Only now, the best deals aren't in the Sunbelt region but rather along the Eastern coast.\u00a0At least that's the view of Matt Frazier, CEO and cofounder of Jones Street Investment Partners, a multifamily investor with roughly $2 billion in assets under management. Frazier thinks the best opportunities have shifted from southern cities like Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, to smaller New England cities like Portland, Maine, as well as Mid-Atlantic hubs like Richmond, Virginia.\u00a0Of course, Jones Street's entire portfolio is focused on the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic multi-family homes. Still, he's created a compelling slideshow that explains why the dynamics have changed in favor of these regions. It's a contrarian view in an industry obsessed with the Sunbelt\u00a0since Jones Street was founded in 2014.\"We came out of the investment world, not out of the real estate world, and our observation was that there was a dangerous amount of groupthink in the industry,\" Frazier told Insider.According to Frazier, one of the biggest reasons for turning north is the impending \"supply glut,\" or fears that a rush of multifamily construction \"could flip the script on the supply and demand imbalance,\" which threatens to lower rental income. According to Jones Street's analysis, \"this dynamic is specific to Southeast and Sunbelt markets,\" not the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.\"Over the next four years, the number of multifamily units delivered in the NeMA is projected to average 1.4% of total supply, which is less than historical averages and less than the 2.2% expected in the Southeast and Sunbelt markets,\" the company wrote in a recent note to investors, a copy of which was obtained by Insider.\u00a0What's more, supply in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions isn't going to surge suddenly, thanks to higher building costs and bureaucratic government control over zoning.\"The current supply and demand imbalance is not likely to be remedied soon,\" the company said in the report. Indeed, Jones Street estimates that if the pace of new housing delivery doubled relative to historical averages, \"it would still take 20 years to find supply and demand equilibrium.\"With $440 billion in multifamily loans coming due by the end of 2024 and many operators underwater on their investments, Jones Street is ready to pounce on the opportunities.\u00a0\"This really substantial wave of loan maturities doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be blood in the streets and a lot of distress, but it certainly will create more deal flow,\" Frazier said.Frazier walked Insider through a Jones Street whitepaper that outlined this thesis and shared some charts that his investor relations team has created to show why the company is focused on smaller markets in the Northeast and Midatlantic, where the fundamentals are good, but investment demand, and therefore pricing, is lower, including Manchester, New Hampshire, Boston, Massachusetts, Portland, Maine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Richmond, Virginia.","label":"Real Estate, BI Prime, Finance, Markets, Real Estate Investing","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/best-place-to-buy-multi-family-homes-rental-properties-2023-9"},"2":{"index":2,"title":"Inside JPMorgan's Plan to Woo Startups After the Fall of SVB and First Republic","date":1695908821000,"content":"The March implosion of Silicon Valley Bank created a\u00a0banking\u00a0vacuum in the startup world.JPMorgan is racing to fill it.So far this year, the Wall Street bank has doubled the head count of its commercial-banking unit dedicated to early-stage companies to more than 400 bankers. This group, dubbed the innovation economy team, has expanded to Beijing, Frankfurt, London, Stockholm, Sydney, Tel Aviv, and Zurich with more than 40 overseas hires.\u00a0Many of the senior hires, both overseas and domestic, came from the ranks of SVB, including the division's new cohead, John China, a 27-year veteran based in San Francisco who joined JPMorgan in July. New York-based Melissa Smith, who has led the innovation economy business since its inception in 2016, told Insider that her co-leader was hired to build trust in Silicon Valley.\u00a0\"It became very clear to us in that March to April timeframe that having a senior West Coast presence that was a known commodity in the VC ecosystem was very important,\" said Smith, who also oversees the specialized industries group that includes the innovation-economy unit. \"We all recognize there is a bit of a void since the events of March, and we have the winning hand to fill that.\"This window of opportunity, however, comes at a grim time for startups. In the second quarter of 2023, venture-capital-backed companies in the US raised 48% less year-over-year, and their median valuations have fallen across nearly all stages, according to PitchBook. But Smith is \"cautiously optimistic\" with signs of green shoots in capital markets. She told Insider that this is the right moment to invest in serving startups and illustrate the advantages of working with a megabank.\"I think JPMorgan has often been viewed as the port in the storm,\" she said.The innovation-economy team was formed to attract middle-market startups and retain them until they grew large enough to need the services of JPMorgan's investment bank. Within the commercial bank, it caters to small and midsize companies with services including credit, financing, treasury and payments, and international banking. JPMorgan declined to specify the unit's revenue.\u00a0Scooping up SVB employees is a well-trodden playbook for the innovation-economy team. In 2019, the group poached four executives from SVB to work with venture capital funds and their portfolio companies. Two years after that, JPMorgan hired another four alumni.The division was preparing to expand before SVB's downfall, Smith told Insider. But these plans were accelerated by the collapse as customers fled to JPMorgan from SVB as well as First Republic, which JPMorgan now owns. Both banks were beloved by Bay Area startups and high-net-worth individuals.\u00a0\"We had a decent influx of clients coming our way, so we needed to make sure we had the resources in place, whether that be in the US or in other countries, to serve those clients that had come knocking at our door,\" she said.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, has openly acknowledged the influence of both banks. \"We're building what we call the innovation economy to do a better job, and what First Republic did and Silicon Valley Bank was a big lesson to us, how they cover those clients,\" he said of the growth efforts at a recent conference.SVB had a particularly strong presence in Israel, and JPMorgan brought back Darya Fuks, an ex-JPMorgan banker who left for software company Wix, to lead a team of 10 former SVB bankers in Tel Aviv in June. First Republic also served emerging venture capital\u00a0firms, an untapped client segment for JPMorgan's commercial bank.The unit's coverage spans life sciences, healthcare, information technology, climate tech, and e-commerce. The purpose behind building out these verticals and expanding geographically is to demonstrate to small startups that they wouldn't get lost in the shuffle at the giant bank.In some aspects, the breakdown of SVB strengthened JPMorgan's appeal to tech upstarts that had previously eschewed too-big-to-fail banks, Smith said.After a rush of hiring this year, Smith expects hiring to slow down in the near term, though JPMorgan has plans to hire innovation-economy bankers in Beijing.The unit's customers have relatively simple needs when it comes to accounting and treasury services, but their needs have shifted in this turbulent market, Smith said.With interest-rate hikes, startups are concerned about getting the most yield on unused cash from fundraises, which wasn't an issue in a zero-interest rate environment, she said.The funding crunch has given JPMorgan a chance to tout Capital Connect, a digital platform for private companies to find investors and vice versa, which was launched in October. The bank also acquired fintech Aumni in March and is integrating its benchmarking term sheet data into Capital Connect\u00a0Bankers are also having tough conversations with clients who are trying to raise funds and facing unattractive valuations.\"I think that's been a huge focus area, particularly in a constrained capital environment,\" she said, \"having that conversation with founders around when is the right time to raise the next round of capital, and helping them kind of digest or get over the hump of a down round or just a valuation that's not as attractive as they would have seen in 2021.\"","label":"Finance, BI Prime, JPMorgan, Startups, Venture Capital, Banking, Wall Street, Finance","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jpmorgan-startups-commercial-bank-svb-first-republic-2023-9"},"3":{"index":3,"title":"\"Dumb Money\" Movie Review Based on GameStop Meme-Stock Trading Saga","date":1696005472000,"content":"When individual investors sent shares of so-called meme stocks skyrocketing in early 2021, putting billion-dollar hedge funds on their heels, one thing seemed obvious: This would make a helluva movie.\u00a0More than two years later, we get to see for ourselves.\"Dumb Money,\" which opens for a wide release today, navigates the lead-up, peak, and aftermath of the GameStop short-squeeze, which led short-sellers to lose billions of dollars.Full disclosure: I was critical of how the movie was cast. But I went into a recent viewing wanting to like \"Dumb Money.\" I'm fascinated by Hollywood's interpretation of finance, from \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Margin Call\" to \"The Big Short.\"\"Dumb Money\" is a classic David-vs-Goliath tale.\u00a0The movie's main protagonist is Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who sparked interest in GameStop with Reddit posts and YouTube videos detailing his investment thesis under the pseudonyms \"DeepFuckingValue\" and \"Roaring Kitty.\"(Like I said, the script practically writes itself.)The film also follows a series of characters \u2014 a pair of college students, a nurse, and a GameStop employee \u2014 who invest in GameStop along with Gill, hoping to make money and stick it to the Wall Street firms betting against the company.\u00a0\u00a0Their inclusion is a smart device \u2014 the GameStop saga was a community-led movement \u2014 but feels underutilized. While Gill was the engine of the short squeeze, individual investors fueled him. A piece of the story falls flat without some meaningful development from them.And then there's the movie's antagonists. The depiction of hedge fund managers Ken Griffin (Nick Offerman), Steve Cohen (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Gabe Plotkin (Seth Rogen), whose firm's GameStop short position put it in Reddit traders' crosshairs, came across as too over-the-top and cartoonish.\u00a0That's not a defense of them. God knows they don't need my help. Griffin reportedly raised hell over his portrayal in the movie.But if satire was the direction the movie wanted \u2014 \u00e0 la \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" \u2014 it should have pushed harder. Instead, Gill's stoner brother (Pete Davidson) has to carry the comedy load, but most of his jokes come up short.\u00a0What's left is a somewhat mediocre movie that's neither too serious nor too funny.So, to tweak a phrase made famous by Gill: For me, I don't like the movie.\u00a0","label":"Finance, Markets, Newsletters, Newsletter, Wall Street","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/dumb-money-movie-review-gamestop-trading-sage-short-squeeze-2023-9"},"4":{"index":4,"title":"5 Economy-Proof Ways to Save Money and Increase Your Peace of Mind","date":1695996019000,"content":"If you're concerned about the state of the economy, you aren't alone. A 2023 survey found that 82% of Americans worry about the impact of inflation. And two in three adults fear the next recession is just months away.In the face of financial uncertainty, it's always wise to reexamine your plan for saving. What steps can you take to shore up against the unknown? How can you maximize your savings and your peace of mind?Saving more money means widening the gap between your income and your expenses.Knowing those numbers is the first step. Try tracking money in and money out for at least one month. Then, use what you've learned to create a strategic plan for your finances \u2014 a simple but powerful budget.\u00a0Next, get creative in reducing those expenses:Two amazing allies when it comes to saving are time and compound interest.When you leave money in an account that offers compound interest, you reap savings exponentially over time. What starts as a few dollars of interest transforms over the years into hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.Savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are ideal tools for reaping compound interest on short-term savings. Consider these accounts for money used for paying bills, traveling next summer, or stashing for a rainy day.\"The most important first step is moving whatever funds you have to save to a separate account to avoid the temptation of spending unnecessarily. Beyond that, it often comes down to a tradeoff between flexibility and earning the highest guaranteed rates possible,\" said Jaspreet Chawla, senior vice president of savings products at Navy Federal Credit Union.\u00a0\"Your standard savings account will generally have a lower rate than a money market account but will allow more options for utility. Certificates, particularly in the 3-month to 18-month range in today's environment, give a higher guaranteed return but lack the option for immediate access without penalty.\"\u00a0Longer-term savings goals might include a college fund for your child or your own retirement savings. For these goals, consider taking on more risk in exchange for higher rates of return with specialized investment accounts. For college, try a 529 Plan or Coverdell ESA. For retirement, explore 401(k) plans, IRAs, Roth IRAs, and dedicated accounts for the self-employed.\"I always recommend meeting with a financial advisor at your bank or credit union because they can help you evaluate the possible solutions to meet your financial needs,\" Chawla added.At some point, an unforeseen expense will come your way. It may be a necessary repair for your home or car, a medical bill, or even a lost job.Facing that event without cash on hand triggers two more problems you definitely don't need \u2014 added stress and the possibility of being forced into costly debt.Fortunately, an emergency fund can carry you smoothly over many financial bumps. And you can start building yours quickly:People often overlook the high cost of interest payments made every month on debt. However, reducing or eliminating those payments frees up cash for extra savings.First, look at every account on which you carry a balance. This may include credit cards, personal loans, car loans, a mortgage, and student loans.Next, examine your interest rates. Are they fixed at a low rate? Variable and subject to climb? Fixed at a rate that's costing you dearly?Assess your options for the debts with the highest interest rates:If you're a current or retired service member \u2014 or if you're part of a military family \u2014 there are a variety of exclusive savings that may be available to you:\"While points and cash back are the primary benefits of using a credit card, many cards have other often overlooked and underused benefits that can save you time and money,\" says Russell Nelson, manager of the credit card products acquisition team at Navy Federal Credit Union.\"For example, maximize benefits by shopping through your card issuer's online shopping portal. By doing so, you can earn extra rewards beyond what you'd get for purchasing in-store or directly from a retailer's website.\"No one knows for sure what the economic landscape will look like next year or even next month. But there are steps you can take to fortify your finances. With the right strategies, you can increase your personal savings and better protect your family.Ready to start saving?

Another $25 million will go toward building up law enforcement on the island, according to the statement.As part of the settlement announced Tuesday, the bank is also paying an additional $20 million in fees for the US Virgin Islands' attorneys, from the firm Motley Rice LLC.The funds come on top of the $290 million JPMorgan Chase has already agreed to settle a separate class-action lawsuit brought by Epstein victims, to fund a compensation program.According to the statement, JPMorgan has also settled legal claims with Jes Staley, the former CEO of Barclays who stepped down in 2021 following revelations about his relationship with Epstein. During an earlier time as a JPMorgan executive, Staley kept close ties with Epstein, exchanging over 1,000 emails, including during a period when Epstein was incarcerated for soliciting sex with a minor.JPMorgan had sued Staley, alleging he was solely responsible for any liability from the US Virgin Islands' lawsuit \u2014 a claim Staley had denied.The settlement arrived hours before lawyers for Staley and JPMorgan were scheduled to argue in a Manhattan federal court over the scope of a trial, which a judge set for October. The terms of the settlement with Staley were not disclosed.The US Virgin Islands had claimed that JPMorgan \"pulled the levers\" of Epstein's sex-trafficking operation by running his bank accounts and turning a blind eye to payments that should have raised alarms within the institution. At least 20 of his victims were paid $1 million through his accounts managed by JPMorgan, the government alleged.In pretrial court filings, JPMorgan claimed the US Virgin Islands government was essentially guilty of the same practices. Local politicians, it claimed, had received donations from Epstein and allowed the pedophile to run rampant as law enforcement turned away from red flags. Epstein owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands, which were sold by his estate earlier this year to billionaire Stephen Deckoff for $60 million.The lawsuits caused turmoil in the US Virgin Islands when they were filed last December. Shortly after they were fired, the territory's governor ousted Denise George, the previous attorney general, who brought the JPMorgan case.In a statement, US Virgin Islands Attorney General Ariel M. Smith said he was looking forward to \"building a new relationship with JPMorgan.\" The bank would inform law enforcement when customers are involved in human trafficking and terminate their accounts, he said.\"This settlement is an historic victory for survivors and for state enforcement, and it should sound the alarm on Wall Street about banks' responsibilities under the law to detect and prevent human trafficking,\" Smith said. \"Our Department of Justice tirelessly pursued this enforcement action to make it substantially harder for traffickers to finance their crimes in the future, and we are confident this settlement will help achieve that goal.\"In a separate statement in response, JPMorgan spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank had not introduced any new policies. It was \"committed to previous and ongoing efforts to fight human trafficking\" through its anti-money laundering program.\"There are no new commitments. Our controls, compliance, risk, and other functions are always improving, and we are continually investing to become even better,\" Wexler said. \"We have always worked closely with law enforcement to help combat human trafficking, and we will continue to look for ways to invest in advancing this important mission.\"The additional funds from JPMorgan, Wexler said, will help the US Virgin Islands improve its own enforcement practices, she said.\"We are pleased that the USVI will use settlement proceeds to enhance the infrastructure and capabilities of their law enforcement to prevent and combat human trafficking and other crimes in their territories,\" she said.Epstein killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019. His acquaintance Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of trafficking girls to him for sex in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million to settle a similar class action lawsuit brought by Epstein's victims, also alleging the financial institution facilitated his sex trafficking. Epstein's estate, following the financier's death, paid out $125 million to his victims.This story has been updated.","label":"News, Finance, Politics, Jeffrey Epstein","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/jp-morgan-settles-virgin-islands-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-suit-2023-9"},"9":{"index":9,"title":"Why Gen Z in the UK Are Struggling More Than Any Generation Before Them","date":1695731377000,"content":"I've been working since I was barely in my teens, first with a morning paper route then part-time in retail during my studies.I'm three years older than my parents were when they bought their first house in 1995 at the age of 21.I make on average \u00a33,000 a month as a freelance writer, roughly \u00a3500 above the monthly median wage in my area, according to PayScale, and still, the prospect of buying a house with my partner feels completely unachievable.I was the first in my family to go to university and consequently racked up almost \u00a365,000, or around $80,000, in student-loan debt.To attend university, I took out both tuition fees and maintenance loans \u2014\u00a0the maintenance loan paid for my accommodation but little else. I worked part-time in retail and as a freelance writer during my studies.After graduating in 2020, I freelanced full time while living on my own. England was in and out of lockdown and I managed to save \u00a35,000 thanks to a lack of expenses aside from rent and utilities.I started my master's degree in 2021 and took out another student loan. It covered my tuition fees but not all of my accommodation, so I had to dip into the money I'd saved the previous year.Between both degrees, as of September 11, I owe \u00a364,834.46 in student loans, with an interest rate of 7.3%. Before June, the interest rate was 12%, but the government has reduced it due to the cost-of-living crisis.For British students in the UK, tuition fees are currently capped at \u00a39,250 a year. In 2006, tuition at a UK university cost an average of \u00a33,000 a year, according to the House of Commons Library. In 1998, when tuition fees were first introduced, I'd have been paying \u00a31,000. Tuition prices have risen far beyond general inflation.The UK has been in a cost-of-living crisis since 2021. The crisis is the fall of disposable incomes in the UK as a result of the national and global rise in inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and the war in Ukraine.While everyone will be affected to some degree, young people \u2014\u00a0who are more likely to have lower incomes and less savings \u2014 are among the most affected.As a freelancer, the money I make each month can fluctuate, but I always make enough to look after my rent, bills, and other expenses.Generally, I can expect to make around \u00a33,000 a month, before taxes. I currently pay around \u00a31,000, or about $1,250, in rent and utilities a month.I'm fortunate to be in a relatively decent financial situation, but I still find it impossible to imagine a real future for myself \u2014 one in which I own a house and a car, have a comfortable standard of living, and the thought of retiring before the age of 75 isn't a pipe dream.When my parents had me in 1999 they were able to raise a family in a house they already owned.My parents said they never had it easy, but they've acknowledged they wouldn't have had the same security or be able to get on the property ladder now.They've had to work hard over the years, but it feels as though their hard work has been rewarded in a way that the hard work of my generation isn't.In 2022, nearly half of young people in the UK surveyed by Deloitte reported spending their entire monthly salary on living costs. This makes saving money for retirement or for a home seem nearly impossible.As of June 2023, the average house price in Bath and North East Somerset, where I live, was \u00a3435,313, up 2.8% from last year, according to the UK House Price Index.Homes are only getting more expensive \u2014 and quickly. Go back a decade, to 2013, and the average house price in this area was \u00a3250,911. In 2003, the average price was \u00a3180,278.The average house price in 1995, when my parents moved in together, was around \u00a356,000. According to the Bank of England's Inflation Calculator, something that cost \u00a310 in 1995 would cost \u00a319.48 in July 2023, an increase of 94.8%.However, if you compare the average house price in 1995 to the average house price in the UK in June 2023 \u2014 \u00a3287,456 \u2014\u00a0it's increased by more than 413%.Meanwhile, median weekly earnings are roughly \u00a3575 according to PayScale, so I'm earning over the average for my area.When my girlfriend and I talk about moving in together in a couple of years, we find the thought of buying a property almost hilarious.My friends and I are resigned to long-term renting, even those of us who have the degrees and qualifications our parents didn't.I chose to go to university and rack up student debt, and I could stop going out to socialize to save more money \u2014\u00a0but it's not feasible to expect all young people to stop living their lives to save.Young people are struggling financially not because they get a latte on their way to work or meet their friends for a drink on the weekend. They're struggling because\u00a0it's simply more difficult to get started as an adult in life now.It's more difficult to get onto the property ladder and to save and plan for the future, whether you buy the occasional small treat to help you through or not.","label":"Opinion, Finance, gen z","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/why-gen-z-financially-struggling-living-in-england-uk-2023-9"},"10":{"index":10,"title":"AI Study With Consultants Shows Impact on Office Workers","date":1695653243000,"content":"When I think of white collar workers, I think first of consultants.Armed with MBAs and case studies, these consultants parachute into the biggest companies in the world to find efficiencies, sharpen strategy, and justify tough decisions.There's been a lot of talk recently around how AI might impact these kinds of so-called knowledge workers.

The pitch session is meant to push them out of their comfort zone, Harry Schwefel, Point72's co-chief investment officer, told Insider.They ask questions like, \"How are you going to get there? What are the building blocks?\" Schwefel said. \"It creates a great forum for Steve to dig into those building blocks to give his own view on things he's seen work and things that haven't worked.\"The exercise is part of Point72's program for emerging long\/short equity investors, LaunchPoint. It takes on internal and external senior analysts looking to take the next step and run their own book.\u00a0It's a chance for Cohen to share his wisdom and draw on his nearly 40 years of experience. The billionaire opened Point72 in 2014 as a family office after his previous firm, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to securities fraud tied to allegations of systemic insider trading.\u00a0Point72 is a pioneer in developing investor talent; the multi-manager has been running LaunchPoint, previously known as Nines, since 2012. It also runs the Point72 Academy, a 10-month boot camp for college graduates looking to become investment analysts.LaunchPoint is an incubator, a training ground for promising analysts to build a team and test their strategies through mock portfolios with the support of Jon Weiner, the head of LaunchPoint and a longtime healthcare PM, and his team. They remain in the program for the first year they manage real client money. Point72 declined to disclose how much money these PMs are seeded with.A pipeline of new managers is handy in times like these, when the world's biggest hedge fund managers are deploying more money and perks to hire top traders. To find long\/short talent\u2014 investors that own some stocks in hopes their prices will rise and others short, hoping their prices will fall\u2014 it's becoming increasingly difficult.\"In my day to day, a good long\/short manager is an endangered species,\" said John Pierson, head of portfolio manager search firm P2 Investments. \"Not that they're going away, but to survive in a market-neutral mode, you have to learn to time the market\u2014 to tilt\u2014 it's a very hard thing to be good at. And if you're good, they're going to move heaven and earth to get you on their side.\"\u00a0And just as Cohen has flexed his billions to build up the roster for his New York Mets, Point72 is involved in the current hedge fund hiring spree.\"We believe that it's important to be incredibly active in the external talent market, but also to not leave things to chance, not leave things to the ebbing and flowing of supply and demand and cyclicality and instead develop it ourselves,' Schwefel said.If the hunt for hedge fund talent resembles bidding wars for star athletes, then Point72's LaunchPoint is its feeder team.\u00a0In a press conference after buying the New York Mets in 2020, Cohen said: \"We're going to build a process that produces great teams year in and year out. You build champions. You don't buy them.\"Weiner said: \"We're taking the same approach here, which is we're not just buying PMs, we're building them internally.\"And they've benefited from setting investors up in-house. More than 70 long\/short managers have launched through LaunchPoint since it started in 2012, and 75% of those are still at Point72. They make up 50% of the firm's 100 long\/short managers. The firm has about 175 PMs globally.Becoming a PM at a multi-manager like Point72 can be daunting: You're handed a significant level of autonomy to run your team and make investment decisions. There are often specific risk parameters and a set amount their strategy can lose before getting the ax.\u00a0For Point72, LaunchPoint was created with the idea that it can take two to three years to figure out how to be a PM.\"Sometimes the mistakes happen before they've even launched capital because of how Jon's team runs their process,\" Schwefel said. \"Sometimes it happens after they've launched, but we're not subjecting them to binary outcomes with drawdowns in those early years because they're figuring it out.\"Point72 helps PMs with startup costs and infrastructure builds, finding the proper research tools, and analyst talent. Weiner and his team, Nick Shivers and Ariel Herman, help facilitate the build-out of models and data, \"anything that basically gives you a nudge, helps you make decisions.\"\"We saw that preparation really influenced the long-term success of new PMs,\" Weiner said.\u00a0\u00a0The program currently has 21 candidates, but it fluctuates as people join or roll off. The candidates are typically split between Point72 senior analysts ready to take the plunge and senior analysts from single-manager hedge funds or their rivals who make it through the firm's intricate hiring process.The candidates come forward with detailed business plans and spend months fine-tuning their investing approach with a paper book that stimulates their portfolio without putting any money at risk.\u00a0There is no set time frame before they go live; Weiner said it could vary between six and 15 months. They launch once PMs have their team, infrastructure, and other necessary tools set, and they've shown signs of success.\u00a0\"We don't just hand the manual to new PMs and say, 'This is how to be a PM.' It's very customized. We're underwriting their business, and we want to help it evolve,\" Weiner said.Griffin Newman, who joined Point72 from Brigade Capital Management in 2015 as an analyst, knew he wanted to evolve into a manager at the firm and made that goal known in the hiring process.After four years of working under another PM, he hit a point where he felt ready. He worked on his business plan for about eight months, getting feedback from his colleagues along the way, ahead of joining LaunchPoint.\u00a0\u00a0\"Places will use the carrot of big dollars that you can manage as a way to get it in there, which I think is just very risky,\" said Newman, referring to other multi-managers. \"I think that the benefit here as you go and do it on a paper book with people monitoring and your dollars scale up in a measured way, it just really ensures your probability of success instead of being thrown totally into the deep end.\"Newman, who started the program in 2019, took about a year to start running his book, which meant he launched during the pandemic. His focus is airplanes and aviation and the sectors that touch that, including industrials, consumers, and tech.\"The scary thing is you're now in charge, and so you're going into a new role where you're managing money, and you have a team of analysts looking up to you to be the point person, making your own decisions when you haven't done it before,\" Newman said.\u00a0 \"And I got to try that into a pandemic, a travel aviation person.\"He was lucky to be able to pick up the phone and call Weiner and other PMs for guidance. He said he still hears Weiner in his head \"every single day\" regarding lessons he learned during the program.\"They're phenomenal at finding your weaknesses or areas that you could be adjusting,\" he said.Weiner was a day-one employee at SAC Advisors. He spent over 25 years as a healthcare PM and personally developed several analysts who went on to run their own money.In 2019, he decided to hand over his team to one of those analysts, Ryan Wilder, who recently left the firm to launch his own healthcare fund, according to Bloomberg.\u00a0\"It was my time to move on and do something else,\" Weiner said. \"And this was just a great next step for me where I could still be part of a firm I grew up in and give back and help the next generation of talent.\"Weiner took over in 2020 and rebranded the program from Nines \u2014 a 10 would mean a person is entirely ready to be a PM \u2014 to LaunchPoint to reflect better what it did.\u00a0Including the annual goal pitching session with Cohen\u2014 which is typically followed by a dinner with him, Weiner has made mentorship core to what he does, from setting up coffees with PMs and candidates in the same sectors to inviting managers to host fireside chats where they talk about their struggles when starting out.\u00a0One such common struggle is team management. Weiner and his team work on communication and encourage conversations with PMs who had issues with their team early on.\"A lot of the PMs go to a place of vulnerability where they really share some of the real challenges that they had,\" Weiner said. \"The hope is really that our new PMs can learn from them, and hopefully avoid them, but if they encounter them, they realize, 'hey, this is not just unique to me.'\"","label":"Finance, BI Prime, Hedge Funds, Trading, Wall Street","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/point72-launchpoint-hedge-fund-steve-cohen-emerging-manager-training-2023-9"},"12":{"index":12,"title":"Citadel Securities in Legal Battle With 2 Ex-Staff Who Started Crypto Firm","date":1695549318000,"content":"Ken Griffin has made some scathing comments about cryptocurrencies in recent years.The billionaire founder of the hedge fund Citadel and Citadel Securities, the market-making firm based in Miami, said in October 2021 that due to the \"lack of regulatory certainty around cryptocurrency, we just aren't involved today.\" He added: \"I just don't want to take on the regulatory risk in this regulatory void that some of my contemporaries are ready to take on.\"Griffin also described crypto as \"a jihadist call\" against the US dollar.Alex Casimo and Leonard Lancia did not share the same view of crypto. They left Citadel Securities Europe in March 2021 and the following month founded Portofino Technologies, a Swiss-based start-up that's developing high-frequency trading-grade technology for digital assets.They publicly announced their new venture in September 2022, along with funding of more than $50 million from outfits including Valar Ventures, Global Founders Capital and Coatue.Valar's founders include Peter Thiel, while Global Founders has invested in companies including Slack, Zalando and HelloFresh over the past two decades.The venture has faced legal challenges by Citadel Securities, whose European arm filed a case in London in June 2022.According to Portofino, Citadel's core complaint is that \"Lancia and Casimo allegedly violated their employment agreements by soliciting Citadel Securities employees\" \u2013\u00a0a claim they reject.A hearing at the London Court of International Arbitration is scheduled for May next year.Citadel has not been content to only contest the matter in Europe. In May this year it began legal action against Portofino in the US as well when it sued the start-up in New York, claiming the founders had stolen \"trade secrets\" and told \"bold-faced lies to their colleagues about their activities and intentions.\"Portofino said in its initial response that Citadel's legal action was \"unmeritorious, anticompetitive and a classic example of corporate bullying.\"The latest chapter in the wrangling came this week when Portofino filed a motion in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to dismiss the suit. It argues it's a European dispute, and that Citadel Europe had chosen to first take action in London. Portofino also stated a desire to conclude the London case as quickly as possible so it could \"proceed with its day-to-day business free of Citadel Securities' intimidation and interference.\"Portofino said there's no evidence it had stolen trade secrets and that the allegations were \"clearly meant to intimidate other Citadel Securities employees who are thinking about jumping ship,\" per the motion.The motion also points out that after Griffin made his comments in October 2021, \"Citadel Securities apparently had a change of heart about crypto.\" In March 2022, Griffin told investors that the firm needed to give \"serious consideration\" to becoming a market-maker in crypto.Per the motion, in December 2021 \"Citadel Europe's outside counsel began \"demanding information from Portofino and its founders, and soon after began shaking down Portofino's recruiters, investors, and potential investors for information about Portofino, including by threatening litigation.\"In January 2022 Griffin sold a $1.2 billion stake in Citadel Securities to venture capital firms Sequoia and Paradigm. CEO Peng Zhao said at the time the funds would help Citadel expand into new asset classes. Matt Huang, the Paradigm cofounder, said that expansion would include crypto, the Financial Times reported.A Citadel Securities representative told Insider in a statement that Lancia and Casimo \"secretly designed and launched\" a crypto market-making firm while employed by Citadel, and \"lied to colleagues and held clandestine investor meetings during which they touted the access and the advantages they gained from working here.\"\"Further, their attempt to improperly poach Vincent Prieur, a New York-based employee described as the 'aggregator of all things crypto' at Citadel Securities, is undisputed.

An Emirati helped change that.As he drew attention at home as an ambitious royal in the mid-2010s, becoming defense minister before the age of 30, it was United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan who helped the Saudi prince's name reverberate in the West.\"MBZ was basically telling Obama, 'You've got to pay attention to this young prince because he will be a future king of Saudi Arabia' \u2014 when at the time, nobody had really heard of him,\" Kristian Ulrichsen, a Middle East fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute, said, referring to Sheikh Mohamed.By giving Crown Prince Mohammed credibility from Washington to London, Sheikh Mohamed, now 62, began to foster a close relationship with the future leader of the biggest economy in the Middle East.That relationship is now fraught.The stratospheric rise of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed in recent years has created a turbulent relationship between him and Sheikh Mohamed \u2014\u00a0a man considered by many to have been his mentor \u2014\u00a0as the crown prince's unrelenting pursuit of glory has threatened to sow deep discord between neighboring states.How the UAE and Saudi Arabia navigate their growing tensions is crucial: The consequences of an escalating rivalry threaten to ripple far beyond the Persian Gulf.While the crown prince and the UAE president started out as close allies, the rivalry between their two nations has deep roots.In the 1950s, a three-year territorial battle known as the Buraimi dispute saw the Saudis attempt to wrestle an oil-rich oasis around the city of Al Ain into their possession, sparking furor in the UAE \u2014\u00a0then part of what was known as the Trucial States.In the '70s, when the British completed their withdrawal from the Gulf in the twilight of their empire, a settlement that established borders between the UAE and Saudi Arabia later left the Emiratis feeling cheated as a huge oil field known as Shaybah went to the Saudis.Ulrichsen said Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE's founder and former president, was believed to have spent \"the rest of his life\" feeling \"he had been tricked by the Saudis\" into giving up this resource-rich area.Fast-forward to the 2000s, and battles seemed to spill into all arenas \u2014 naval standoffs, disputes over a gas pipeline from Qatar, and fallout over a proposed common currency in the Gulf came to define the relationship between the two nations.It wasn't until the Arab Spring that the competing nations found significant common ground.\"Both the UAE and Saudi, especially Abu Dhabi, felt that Qatar was supporting different groups, and they aligned against Qatar, and this brought them onto the same page,\" Ulrichsen said.It was only a matter of time before sparks would fly again: The two states are battling to determine which will be the region's superpower.\"These are two countries increasingly eyeing each other in a hostile way for geo-economic purposes and are going to be at odds with one another on an array of issues,\" Abishur Prakash, the founder of the Geopolitical Business, an advisory firm, said.On an economic front, the UAE has had a huge head start with Dubai, which has consistently been a destination for young Saudis and others seeking jobs not available at home, as well as foreign direct investment from global businesses looking for a gateway to the Middle East.That advantage is now threatened by Vision 2030 \u2014\u00a0the crown prince's radical transformation plan to future-proof Saudi Arabia's economy by reducing its dependence on oil. Its scope is enormous.Along with \"gigaprojects\" such as The Line \u2014 a 100-mile-long glass structure on the cusp of the Red Sea envisioned as a car-free, futuristic city for 9 million people \u2014 Vision 2030 is targeting entertainment, hospitality, and travel as growth areas for the country.These sectors, of course, are central to the UAE's economy, making Saudi Arabia's focus on them a direct competitive threat.\"You cannot have a business hub in two neighboring countries in such close proximity,\" Abdullah Alaoudh, the Saudi director at the Freedom Initiative, a US human-rights organization, said. \"Sometimes their influence or their interests, actually, do not see eye to eye.\"Recent developments have made this direct competition clearer than ever. In March, Saudi Arabia unveiled Riyadh Air, a new airline serving as an alternative to the UAE's Emirates and Etihad Airways.In 2021, the Saudi Public Investment Fund completed its $400 million takeover of Newcastle United FC, giving it ownership of a sports club that would directly compete in the English Premier League against the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.Saudi Arabia is also upping the ante as it prepares to introduce regulations that go into effect on January 1 barring foreign companies from operating in the country unless their regional headquarters is also there. Several firms have their bases in the UAE.\"A move like that fundamentally redesigns the relationship between the UAE and Saudi Arabia,\" Prakash said. \"You're telling the world to pick sides. If you want to do business with Saudi Arabia or Saudi state-owned entities, you've got to base your regional HQ in Saudi Arabia.\"Experts say Crown Prince Mohammed's full-blooded political ambitions have made relations between the UAE and Saudi Arabia a real high-wire act, too.The anti-corruption purge that turned Riyadh's Ritz Carlton into a prison for elite Saudis targeted by the crown prince in 2017 sparked alarm as the consequences of unbridled ambition from the leader presented a huge uncertainty.The murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 \u2014 which an intelligence report released by the Biden administration in 2021 concluded had been approved by the Saudi crown prince \u2014 presented a similar uncertainty.\"I think there was a concern that MBS seemed to have no limits over his actions,\" the Baker Institute's Ulrichsen said. \"It was almost a wake-up call to some people in Abu Dhabi, like, 'What's next?'\"The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been sparring well beyond their own borders, too. A critical flash point has been Yemen, where the UAE formed a part of the Saudi-led intervention into the country torn by civil war in March 2015. The two are now on opposing sides.As the war has descended into a full-blown humanitarian crisis following periods of intense airstrikes and targeting of Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the Saudis have sided with the Yemeni government, while the UAE has backed an opposing secessionist group in the south.\"For Saudi Arabia, this is a very dangerous game,\" Alaoudh said. \"Saudi Arabia sees the separation project in Yemen as a way to let the Houthis control the north and therefore have a more-threatening border at the south of Saudi Arabia.\"How far the rivalry between the two nations goes largely depends on Saudi Arabia's actions. While a Qatar-style blockade is unlikely, experts told Insider, Saudi Arabia may look to push the UAE by getting the upper hand economically.Both are members of the oil cartel OPEC+ but have opposite stances on oil production. Saudi Arabia is seeking to reduce production as crude nears $100 a barrel; the UAE said in July it wouldn't make further voluntary production cuts.Prakash added that much of this now came down to the crown prince's ability to deliver on the central promises of Vision 2030.\"Is Saudi Arabia posing a threat today to the UAE? No, because the projects Saudi Arabia is working on are not finished yet,\" he said. \"The Line is an incredible project, but once it's built, will people come? That's the million-dollar question.\"Evidence also suggests some promises may not be kept. During a press conference in 2016, the same year the Vision 2030 project was announced, the crown prince made the bold claim that Saudi Arabia \"can live without oil\" by 2020.Three years have passed, and the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco generated record profits of $161 billion in 2022, with Saudi Arabia's role as the world's top oil exporter boosted by the Ukraine war.\"We're almost going to finish the year 2023, and Saudi Arabia is more dependent on oil than ever,\" Alaoudh said.The foreign investment needed for Vision 2030 has also been slow to arrive. Figures published in July by the United Nations showed that Saudi Arabia's foreign direct investment dropped almost 60% to $7.9 billion last year, but the figure for the UAE rose by 10% to $23 billion.Ulrichsen said this reflected the fallout from the Ritz Carlton siege, which spooked overseas investors: \"Foreign-investment levels collapsed after that, partly because investors were thinking, 'Well what happens if our business partner suddenly gets detained?'\"That said, there is still a possibility of Saudi Arabia pulling off a generational transformation.

The collection is managed by a company called Seline-Invest, which is in turn owned by Abramovich's trust, the Ermis Trust Settlement, according to the investigation.The collection is worth an estimated $963 million and includes works by some of the greatest modern artists including Picasso, Monet, Freud, and Hockney.\"You could fill a museum with it \u2013 this is a stupendous collection,\" Goldsmiths, University of London curation professor Andrew Renton told The Guardian.Masterpieces like Francis Bacon's \"Triptychs, 1976\" cost the couple $86.3 million, the highest price paid at auction for a post-war work, per The Art Newspaper.Abramovich and Zhukova, who married in 2008 and separated in 2017, amassed the artworks over a decade during which they became prominent figures in the art world. The collection was stored in south London, with items occasionally lent to galleries under the anonymous label of \"private collector,\" The Guardian reported.The investigation also uncovered that Abramovich made moves to protect the collection from asset seizures against Russian oligarchs in the weeks before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.The couple previously held a half-share of the collection, but the documents showed that Zhukova took a 51% share on 4 February 2022.The restructuring enabled Abramavich to maintain possession of the collection, as only assets that were majority-owned by a sanctioned individual were subject to seizure.Zhukova is a darling of the global art scene and is on the boards of several famous galleries. Through her second marriage she is now a US citizen and exempt from any sanctions. She has condemned Putin's \"acts of war,\" per The Guardian.Abramovich was among seven Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK in March last year. His assets, including Chelsea soccer club, were frozen and his $700 million superyacht, on which pieces from the art collection are believed to be displayed, was seized.He is also blocked from doing business in Britain or entering the UK.The leaked files only date back to 2022, leaving the current location of the collection unclear.Representatives for Abramovich and Zhukova did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider.

Hundreds of speakers are scheduled to give presentations aimed at helping delegates develop \"new strategies for understanding the greatest challenges and opportunities of the new era,\" according to the FII.The annual event is the largest investment and business conference in the Middle East, and has been compared to Davos \u2013 the Swiss ski resort that hosts the World Economic Forum each January. Last year's event attracted top brass from the likes of Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, Bridgewater Associates, and BlackRock, as well as FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried and Jared Kushner, per NPR.It's a marked change from just five years ago, when many western execs shunned the event following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its consulate in Istanbul. While claims about human rights abuses in the region persist, the interest in the conference suggests that many are prepared to overlook them.That's partly because of the slump in deals following sharp rises in interest rates in the US and elsewhere in the past 18 months, sparking renewed interest in the oil-rich Middle East.As well as being a forum for discussion, the event is also an accelerator for Saudi investment opportunities. At last year's conference, more than 28 investment deals worth over $9 billion were signed, according to the US-Saudi Business Council.For the first time this year's conference is only open to FII Institute members and strategic partners, at an annual cost of $15,000. Nonetheless, it is still expecting to draw 5,000 delegates.The event also furthers Saudi Arabia's ambitious plans to diversify its economy and strengthen the country in line with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030. His strategy has seen the kingdom invest billions in sports, entertainment, and technology.This year's theme, The New Compass, signals the Saudis' notion of a new global order in which \"centuries-old economic models start to unravel while new systems and frameworks begin to take shape,\" according to the event guide.While the FII does not yet attract the same attention of the Davos summit, the demand for this year's event underlines the rising global interest in Saudi Arabia.","label":"Finance, Saudi Arabia","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/saudi-business-conference-davos-in-desert-costs-15000-attend-2023-9"},"17":{"index":17,"title":"Inside Mortgage Startup Better's Latest Round of Job Cuts","date":1695412161000,"content":"Two days before its highly anticipated stock-market debut, top executives of mortgage startup Better, including CEO Vishal Garg, held an all-hands meeting to celebrate with staff.\u00a0The stock debut, the result of a long-delayed SPAC merger, would give the company access to $565 million in capital, which Garg, had said would be used to improve the company as it waits for mortgage demand to pick up. Staff were treated to a bubbly toast and assured that the company was finally at the right size to be successful and grow, according to two people who attended the meeting.\u00a0CFO Kevin Ryan told employees that they could finally \"sleep and breathe easier\" after two years of cutbacks that have reduced the ranks by 91%, according to the two people who attended the meeting, both of whom were Better employees.\u00a0On its first day of trading on August 24, shares of the newly formed company\u00a0 \u2014 following a SPAC combination with Aurora Acquisition Corp. \u2014 plummeted 93% from where Aurora had traded the day before. (Excluding Aurora's stock price, shares of the Nasdaq-listed Better Home & Finance are down more than 59% from the opening day.)\u00a0Roughly two weeks later, on September 6, Better laid off about a quarter of its US mortgage sales and origination team, which underwrites the company's mortgage loans, interacts with its customers, and is considered a revenue generator for the company, according to the two employees. The employees, who said they were let go via phone calls, spoke to Insider on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution and concern for their future job prospects.\u00a0The two former employees say the company now has about 75 employees on the mortgage origination team in the US as well as some employees in India. Better spokeswoman Jessica Schaefer told Insider the company has over 100 people left on the team.\u00a0At the time of the SPAC merger, Better boasted 950 employees. According to the one laid-off employee, the company used to have 70 managers on the sales team, roughly the amount of total employees left after the layoff.\u00a0In an emailed statement, Schaefer said that the company plans to replace at least some of the laid-off employees. \"New projections and remarks from chair Jay Powell signal no near-term relief from elevated borrowing costs so the mortgage market will continue to get tougher,\" she said. \"We are hiring more seasoned professionals who can sell in this tough mortgage environment and then making them 10x more productive through our technology.\"Employees were given 30 days of pay, and up to three months of company-provided COBRA coverage, according to two laid-off employees.Garg, who made headlines in 2021 for brutally laying off hundreds of employees via Zoom, told Insider before the deal that the $565 million from the SPAC merger, most of it from a SoftBank convertible note, would allow the company to acquire underperforming mortgage platforms and continue to develop its technological platform, which both laid-off employees praised as the best in the business. Garg also said the money would give the company breathing room to wait out the rough market, and predicted a refinancing boom once interest rates fall.The mortgage industry has been hit hard by rising rates, leading to revenue declines and layoffs across the industry. But Better has been hit particularly hard, dropping from the nation's 10th largest mortgage originator in 2021 to the 59th largest by the first quarter of this year. The company, which posted a $172 million profit in 2020, lost $1.2 billion from 2021 to 2022, and recorded an additional $135.4 million in losses through the first half of this year.\u00a0Both former employees told Insider that they were optimistic that the cash infusion might offer some relief after a year of what felt like constant layoffs. One of the employees described a team Zoom meeting where multiple people realized during the call that their Slack had been deactivated, a sign that they were laid off. Those people were able to say goodbye to colleagues before their laptops were shut down remotely, the employee said.\u00a0","label":"Real Estate, BI Prime, Startups, Finance, Mortgage, Layoffs, SPAC","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/mortgage-startup-better-cut-jobs-after-spac-merger-stock-debut-2023-9"},"18":{"index":18,"title":"How Media Investors Stay on Top of Industry Innovation, AI: Shamrock","date":1695400430000,"content":"To say that the media industry is rapidly evolving would be an understatement.New technologies are changing how films are made, TV shows are produced, and entertainers monetize their craft. Companies ranging from advertising agencies to studios and streamers are overhauling how they work with tech tools like artificial intelligence \u2014 which, ironically, are also at the heart of the writers' and actors' strikes that have largely ground Hollywood production to a halt.\"Every day there's a new article or a story or disruption taking place,\" Andrew Howard, a partner at Shamrock Capital, told Insider this summer about the firm's media strategies. It's \"really hard to invest\" in the space, he added, \"if you're not paying attention.\" Shamrock, which is based in California, pursues strategies in the private markets, mainly through equity or debt-based investments. Earlier this year, the firm reported managing roughly $4.4 billion in assets.So, in a niche that's undergoing such rapid evolution, how do investors stay on top of all the developments?\"It helps that we're thematic investors, meaning we're constantly evaluating the trends and deciphering where the puck is headed for the foreseeable future,\" Howard explained, adding that Shamrock is deliberate about its investments. Decisions to back new portfolio companies \"may take long\" or follow a series of meetings with management teams, he said: \"We're following them for a period of time, so when they're ready for capital, we're already up to speed as to what the business is doing and why they need capital and what we can do to help effectuate and continue their growth trajectory.\"Founded as a family office in the late 1970s for members of the Disney family, the firm has blossomed into an institutional investor exclusively focused on media, entertainment, and communications. It launched a designated debt opportunities fund in 2021, announcing it had raised nearly $200 million, to help support \"owners of entertainment IP across the film, television, music, games, sports media rights and other content sectors.\" Earlier this year, Shamrock announced a new fund intended to \"acquire a diverse and global portfolio of content and media rights,\" saying it had raised some $600 million.Howard likened the speed of today's transformations to the dot-com arms race that defined the Internet landscape two decades ago.\"Has the disruption always been there? No doubt,\" he said. \"It goes back even to the late nineties with the burgeoning Internet, which is very similar to where we are today with AI.\"He pointed to one helpful strategy: Turning to the young \u2014 or at least the young at heart \u2014 for their insights about where consumers' heads are, and how they're spending their money.\"It's so important to get the perspective of some of our 20-year-olds, our 20-somethings, because they have a different consumption behavior,\" Howard said. \"Where do they spend their disposable income? It's essential to get that viewpoint,\" Howard said, adding that the firm's leaders routinely ask more junior team members about their media and entertainment habits: \"What are you seeing? What are you doing on the weekends?\" Then there's another factor that doesn't hurt: Being an industry insider.\"We're coaching kids whose parents are running major studios and companies within media and entertainment,\" Howard said. \"This is why it's wonderful to be here in Los Angeles.

But let's face it, many of the tasks junior bankers spend their time on could very well be done by a robot.Talk to any entry-level investment banker and they will tell you their day is full of tedious chores: Adding corporate logos to slideshows, fixing a messy million-row Excel sheet to look neat, and gathering information on a company or industry and summarizing it into a document.\"A lot of the work analysts do is very mundane. You're doing random Excel stuff or editing a deck or putting logos on a Powerpoint,\" said a first-year investment banking analyst who works on tech deals. \"As a junior banker you don't critically think. You just do as you're told.\"With artificial intelligence progressing by leaps and bounds, how will it impact the job of the junior banker? Insider spoke to six finance professionals, including an entry-level banker. We learned that AI could be good for junior financiers, making their jobs less tedious and maybe even improving their notoriously grueling schedules. But it could also mean firms will require fewer analysts on staff, making an already competitive industry even fiercer, and causing them to raise the bar when it comes to the skills required to break into the field.To some extent, it's happening already. Deutsche Bank, for example, has begun testing out generative AI pilots, and Insider spoke to Tamara Bitticks, one of the execs involved in the project, to get her insights into how it's going and what the future holds. She said it's already helping junior bankers get their jobs done faster.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you think about AI, it's advancing fast and will have major implications for our lives and work. Here's what it could mean for people who start off on the lowest rungs of the investment banking career ladder.According to a recent study by consulting firm Deloitte, generative AI will unleash \"a new era of productivity\" for investment banking, boosting the productivity of front-office workers by as much as 35% by 2026, which could translate to additional revenue of at least $3 million per employee.\u00a0It also has the potential to improve the lives of junior bankers, who work long hours, sometimes upwards of 100 hours a week. Junior bankers can use the tech for a range of tasks, like creating pitch books, industry reports, and performance summaries, according to the Deloitte study. They can also use it to help generate deal structures, peer analysis, and term sheets.\u00a0Industry insiders agree.\"It could be a good thing for banking if there are some parts that are more automated because it'll get rid of some of the work that takes hours and hours for some of these junior guys to go through,\" said a Wall Street recruiter who specializes in placements in investment banking.\"It could be good for the hours,\" added the first-year analyst. Both the analyst and the recruiter asked to remain anonymous because they weren't authorized by their companies to speak to the press.Over at Deutsche Bank, executives like Bitticks are seeing the benefits firsthand. The bank has been running dozens of generative AI pilots and hiring hundreds of engineers to transform how its employees work across the firm. Some of the pilots aim to improve time-consuming and mundane tasks carried out by juniors in the corporate bank, which serves Deutsche's institutional clients, financial services firms, and investors.One tool set to launch at the beginning of the year will use AI to generate reports senior bankers need to prepare for client meetings, Bitticks said. Making one of these reports \u2014 which brief the bankers on leadership changes, company performance, and relevant industry trends \u2014 usually takes a team of junior bankers a day or two to produce, said Bitticks, vice chair in Deutsche's corporate bank.\u00a0The new tool will allow these reports to be created in just a few keystrokes.The technology will pave the way for \"a new way of being a banker,\" Bitticks said, and enable juniors to focus on building up more analytical skills and soft skills.\"What I struggle with our juniors a lot of times is they're gathering the information, and they're so consumed with the gathering that they don't think about the analyzing,\" Bitticks told Insider in an interview at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco last month.\u00a0\"AI gives them these great tools to know what all the data is behind the scenes and to come in fully up to speed on what the client's doing and allows them to worry about the engagement itself instead of putting all the data together,\" Bitticks said.\u00a0The recruiter echoed that sentiment, saying AI could allow analysts to do \"more of the associate level work in the future.\"\u00a0Peter Torrente, a partner at KPMG working with financial services firms, agreed that AI may require future generations of junior bankers to hone their analytical skills and become better at understanding data and extracting insights.\"It will allow junior bankers to operate at a higher level with that first pass of analysis being prepared by the technology,\" said Torrente. But it will also likely give bankers larger datasets to work with \u2014 whether it's a broader peer analysis or data that goes further back in time \u2014 which will lead to more investigating and analysis on behalf of the banker, he added.The skills required to become a Wall Street trader or investment banker are also changing in other ways, said Bogdan Tudose of Training the Street (TTS), which preps up-and-coming finance and business students and new hires at client firms like Blackstone, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley.\"Coding is becoming an essential skill for all bankers and financial analysts to have,\" explained Tudose. \"They don't need to be full-on computer scientists or engineers; however, they need to know some of the fundamentals so they can automate some of their processes and also deal with large data. In this day and age, some of the data sets our PE and bank clients are dealing with are too large to even open up in Excel.\"While AI is expected to add to this burden, it could also help people acquire new skills faster. For example, Tudose's students are using tools like ChatGPT to dramatically reduce the time it takes them to produce code to automate a task.In the past, a financial analyst might spend two to three hours creating the code \"by first googling or reading forums, copying someone else's code, and then having to modify it for their own use case,\" said Tudose. \"Now, with tools such as ChatGPT, as long as you provide it the correct prompt, they can get some initial draft code in a matter of seconds to get them started.\"The proliferation of generative AI could also have its downsides. By turning over more of the mundane tasks to automation, AI also threatens to make the uber-competitive industry even harder to break into. The fewer tasks there are to be done by humans, the fewer junior workers firms will need.\"In the future maybe instead of 10 analysts, you only need five,\" said the first-year analyst.\u00a0\"It's good for people in the industry. I guess it's bad for the people trying to break into the industry,\" the analyst added. \"There are going to be less roles, so it will be hyper competitive.\"Tudose of Training the Street says he's hearing these same concerns from some of his students. People who have already broken into the industry are excited about the technology because they see it improving their workflow. New hires are more worried about generative AI replacing them, Tudose said.\u00a0But he warned against buying too heavily into doomsday predictions. \"Generative AI 'hallucination' is a real problem right now,\" he added, comparing it to the introduction of Excel, which had people predicting that accountants and financial analysts would be out of a job.\"Sure, it replaced some very low-entry jobs, but overall models have become more complex and powerful,\" Tudose said. \"Tools such as generative AI will have the same impact. They will help automate some of the mundane, repetitive tasks so that analysts can focus on more value-add analysis and apply critical thinking to their models.\"\u00a0In other words,\u00a0 there will always be a need for humans to check the work done by AI.\"Some of our participants joke in our classes that ChatGPT is currently a 'glorified intern' who is overconfident in their answer but you still have to fix up their mistakes and double-check for any incorrect information,\" Tudose said.The recruiter agreed \u2014 there will always be a need for some analyst roles, he said.\"At the end of the day, regardless of if there is a model or a presentation that was built by AI, I still think that they're going to require the human touch to be behind that before showing it to the client realistically,\" said the recruiter.\u00a0In addition to Deutsche Bank's initiatives, Visa's tech chief wants to have every employee working with AI by the end of the year; Goldman Sachs is piloting AI to help its 12,000-strong engineer workforce code more efficiently; JPMorgan has a team of about 60 academics who focus purely on researching the possibilities of AI.Though Wall Street's embrace of AI is accelerating, industry insiders predict it could be many years before financial firms widely adopt it.\u00a0A recent KPMG study found that 40% of financial services executives surveyed said their organization's IT and digital infrastructure would limit their ability to innovate and adapt to advancements in AI. Financial firms built on legacy systems come with a price (for maintenance), leaving less money on the table to pursue new technologies, the survey found.\u00a0\"Banks are moving more work to cloud environments, where they would have more flexibility and agility in adding new capabilities such as LLM models, but the process is slow,\" the KPMG report says. \"Banks can also face organizational barriers that limit their agility versus fintech startups. As a result, they may struggle to keep pace with the rapid innovation and product development cycles of cloud-native and AI-native startups, losing market share to these more agile competitors. Legacy asset managers face some of these same challenges.\"The first-year analyst told Insider that he isn't very worried about AI taking his job because the finance industry is so \"slow\" that it'll take a long time to see actual implementation at an industry-wide level. By the time that happens, if it does, he'll be at his next gig on the buy side.The investment banking recruiter agreed.\u00a0\"I don't want to be naive because technology is obviously moving very quickly,\" he said. \"I just don't know how quickly the adoption of those things will be across all firms. Banks are such regulated environments and it probably has to go through so much regulatory discretion to really ultimately be implemented across all firms.\"","label":"Finance, BI Prime, Careers","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-ai-will-change-the-investment-banking-career-path-2023-9"},"20":{"index":20,"title":"Robinhood Is Cutting Jobs and Focusing on Credit Cards to Solve a Shrinking User Base, Insiders Say","date":1695332333000,"content":"Robinhood is laying off more employees and reorganizing teams as part of a new focus on credit cards as the company tries to mitigate a shrinking user base, insiders say.In June, Robinhood announced plans to acquire no-fee credit card startup X1 for $95 million.

Credit cards are much higher-margin products than stock-trading and generally less exposed to volatile markets.A Robinhood spokesperson confirmed after publication that Robinhood made internal changes as a result of the acquisition and laid off what the spokesperson said was a very small number of the 60 employees who joined Robinhood since the acquisition. The company is still hiring and has 200 open roles, the spokesperson said.The changes come as Robinhood tries to address a shrinking user base.

The layoff was widely reported, but audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by Insider recently showed ongoing cuts have been deeper.It's unclear when the company made its most recent job cuts. Posts on a private group for people with a Robinhood.com email address on the tech-industry chat app Blind suggests layoffs as recently as Thursday, according to screenshots viewed by Insider.Last week, after Robinhood released its monthly metrics report for August, JPMorgan analysts said in a research note that performance \"seems to once again prove that retail is generally less active in weaker markets as both client engagement and client returns struggled in August.\" However, August is generally slower for user engagement overall, the analysts noted.The Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood has been expanding into other businesses for a couple of years. In 2021, it bought Say Technologies, which connects companies with retail shareholders, for $140 million.\"We started with trading and investing.

Moreover, many of them were able to buy stocks and homes at far lower prices in the past, and have enjoyed substantial appreciation in the value of their assets.McDonald's X post made the point that higher rates have lifted yields on Treasury bills to more than 5%. As a result, baby boomers have the option to cash out their profits, invest in short-term government debt, and collect a solid, guaranteed return.The former Lehman Brothers trader, who wrote a book about the investment bank's collapse at the start of the financial crisis, has flagged wealth disparities between generations before. He's noted that at the age of 40, baby boomers had paid far less for college and their homes than millennials, a larger percentage owned homes, and they generally had higher net worths and smaller debts.\"Baby boomer party, then left the check in the lap of Millennials,\" McDonald tweeted in early 2019. He's also noted that boomers were worth an estimated $78 trillion, or about half the US total, at the end of last year. That's despite the cohort making up just a fifth of the US population.While baby boomers are under fire for hoarding wealth, their spending in retirement could prove crucial in sustaining the economy and preventing a recession, market veteran Ed Yardeni argued this summer.\u00a0","label":"Economy, Finance, Economy, Millennials, Federal Reserve, Inflation, Recession, Interest Rates, Bonds","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/baby-boomers-millennials-wealth-generation-inequality-fed-rates-housing-mcdonald-2023-9"},"23":{"index":23,"title":"Warren Buffett Age, Net Worth, Lifestyle: How He Spends Fortune","date":1695320061000,"content":"Warren Buffett's had a good year \u2014 his fortune has ballooned by more than $16 billion so far.With an estimated net worth of $124 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the 93-year-old\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO is now the sixth-wealthiest person in the world.

(Although that doesn't hurt.) Partner status comes with a certain cachet across the Street: This person is the real deal.\u00a0With that in mind, why does it seem like so many partners have headed for the exits recently?\u00a0A recent Insider investigation by Dakin Campbell and Emmalyse Brownstein found that at least 202 partners have left the firm during CEO David Solomon's volatile five-year tenure.\u00a0But Dakin didn't stop there, interviewing six partners about what led them to leave. The conversations provide a fascinating glimpse into a person's rationale for leaving a role some consider to be the pinnacle of the field.\u00a0\u00a0And while Solomon's strategic missteps were a key talking point for many, not all the former partners bashed the CEO. Some defended their old boss to Dakin, pointing to the number of changes he's taken on during his tenure.The bank, meanwhile, has long pushed back on the notion of a partner exodus, explaining the turnover as the natural changing of the guard and pointing to an increase in the average tenure of partners.But much of the interest around partner exits isn't just about how many partners have left. It's also about which ones have gone.\u00a0This year alone Julian Salisbury, once considered a CEO contender, and Dina Powell McCormick, one of the most senior women at the bank, both departed. Even new entrants to the partnership aren't sticking around. Fred Baba, considered a rising star at the bank, left less than six months after being named a partner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One former partner noted broader exits at the firm could boil down to flushing out the people who weren't willing to back Solomon's vision.\u00a0But how many of those people are still at the firm? Ahead of Solomon taking the reins from Lloyd Blankfein back in 2018, Dakin compiled a list of executives in Solomon's inner circle and key members of his broader management team.\u00a0Fast forward to today, and roughly half of Solomon's ardent supporters have since left.Before the opening bell:\u00a0US stock futures are flat Wednesday ahead of the Fed's interest-rate decision.\u00a01.

The industry got a boost early on in the pandemic with a rash of home buying (which has since subsided) and a flood of people entering the profession. The business also became more reliant on the web in the pandemic as people went online to tour and buy homes and watch real estate influencer content.O'Brien, who appeared on Insider's 2022 list of Rising Stars in the Entertainment Business, said Estate Media grew out of a serendipitous meeting he had with Flagg and Shanfeld, whom he met through a friend, Jack Davis, co-founder of Crypt TV. He took inspiration from other personality-driven companies like Magnolia \u2014 the content and merch empire built around former HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines \u2014 and The Chernin Group-backed Epic Gardening.\"The idea was, can we create an ecosystem play where we bring in all these personalities and create assets around them that we own,\" O'Brien told Insider. \"There were these old real estate pubs and reality programming and there really wasn't anyone in the middle who was creating content that was entertaining and also educating.\"The company will offer content created with a network of real estate personalities who, Estate Media said, reach a collective 25 million followers.The mission is to be trade-focused while also serving consumers. Initial offerings include a class by Flagg, an original star of Bravo's \"Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\" which follows real estate agents as they try to sell high-end properties. There's also a podcast featuring TikTok-famous broker Margot Ettedgui discussing pop-culture trends and celeb real estate gossip; and a video podcast where agent and TikToker Aaron Grushow chats with other big names in the business like Robert Rivani, Glennda Baker, and Ricky Carruth. Other shows for digital and television are in the works.\u00a0Bringing media business expertise is O'Brien, who serves as Estate Media's CEO and worked in content acquisition at Roku and Amazon before moving to Pocket.Watch, a studio that tries to turn YouTube stars into global franchises.The company plans to make money through advertising from real estate, financial, and luxury brands; providing leads to real estate companies; and paid membership to communities built around the network of influencers. O'Brien said he expects ad revenue to top $1 million this year and that he sees educational content becoming a \"nice seven-figure business.\"While the real estate industry has come down from its pandemic frenzy, O'Brien believes Estate Media can ride ups and downs in the market.\u00a0\"The number of new people coming in is unsustainable, but it will remain the largest asset class in the world,\" he said. \"There are always going to be buyers and sellers seeking information.\"\u00a0Estate Media has raised $1.65 million in seed funding from Adam Weitsman, CEO of Upstate Shredding, a scrap metal processor, and Chris Heller, president of Ojo Labs, a real estate tech company, as well as several investors with media backgrounds: Rich Antoniello, co-founder and former CEO of Complex Networks, Austin Rief, co-founder and CEO of Morning Brew, and Devin Emery, chief content officer of Morning Brew.

As the firm names 80 or so new partners every two years, a number close to 200 would need to leave over five years to make way for the new elite class.\u00a0\"There's nothing that's going on in the context of partner transitions that's different than any other cycle,\" Solomon said earlier this month at an investor conference. The average tenure from executives once they make partner has increased from 6.2 years to 8.3 years, Goldman says.\u00a0But the departures arrive as Solomon faces a barrage of negative press, focused on his use of the corporate jet, his strategy missteps, and his temperament.An August piece in New York magazine put it bluntly, asking: \"Is David Solomon Too Big a Jerk to Run Goldman Sachs?\"\u00a0To better understand their reasons for leaving, Insider set out to gather the perspectives of former partners. Interviews with six of them who have left over the past year or so, as well as with one former managing director, shed fresh light on what's going on inside Goldman, and why so many are exiting.The executives worked in different parts of the bank, and each had their own motivation for leaving. They've since moved to smaller rivals or to clients, or are keeping their next step under wraps.\u00a0There's no way of fully capturing the reasons behind each and every partner's departure under Solomon. But put together, the interviews highlighted a few recurring themes, including personnel decisions, pay, and strategy missteps.\"You want to suspend belief and say, I will follow these guys, but with the number of people mistakes and business-strategy mistakes that they have made, I think people have lost confidence in the plan,\" said one former partner who was referring to Solomon and Goldman's president and chief operating office, John Waldron. The person, like the others, was granted anonymity to preserve their relationships at the bank and in the industry. Their identities are known to Insider.Some of those who spoke with Insider defended Solomon, pointing out that he had made a lot of changes in a short amount of time and that some turmoil was to be expected. They didn't excuse his strategic mistakes but acknowledged that he felt that his mandate would modernize Goldman Sachs in a way that his predecessors didn't or, perhaps, couldn't.\u00a0In particular, before Solomon, Goldman nurtured many fiefs and then spread the wealth from the most successful ones across the firm. Under Solomon, that model has been turned on its head in favor of delivering return-on-equity targets for investors in a way that made Goldman more like JPMorgan.Goldman's lead director, Adebayo Ogunlesi, acknowledged that Goldman lost some partners \"it did not want to lose in part due to disagreements as GS began acting more like a Fortune 50 firm,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a September 18 report after meeting with Ogunlesi and referencing the company's stock ticker.\u00a0\u00a0Investors have largely supported the shift. Goldman's stock has gained 94% since the end of 2018, compared with a 79% increase in the S&P 500, Devin Ryan, a JMP analyst, wrote in a September 11 report.\"We think it is also fair to criticize certain aspects of management and its decisions, including Mr. Solomon, as that comes with the territory,\" Ryan wrote. \"However, when looking back on how the firm has operated since 2019 (Mr. Solomon took the helm in late 2018), we would highlight that a lot has gone right.\"Nonetheless, the changes Solomon has made have angered many current and former employees, partners and managing directors alike, one of the people said.\"It was a multiyear process of pissing a lot of people off,\" the person said.Of the former Goldman executives that Insider interviewed, here are the most cited reasons they gave for leaving Goldman.\u00a0\u00a0One doesn't get too far into a conversation with a former partner before hearing complaints about the personnel decisions made by Solomon or Waldron.\u00a0According to the former partners, as well as those still at the bank who spoke with Insider, Solomon and Waldron have repeatedly elevated executives without the appropriate management experience into much larger roles, or placed people in charge of teams where they had no industry experience. In many of those cases, the handpicked executives have failed to execute on the firm's strategic priorities.Solomon and Waldron have justified the appointments by saying that talented executives should be able to flourish anywhere and that an internal candidate who knows Goldman's culture is preferable to an outsider.\u00a0Yet the appointments have had destabilizing effects on various teams and contributed to the turmoil, some of the people said. Managers below them in the division have had to spend time on backfilling positions or calming anxieties when they could be focused on developing new business.\"That's absurd,\" Tony Fratto, a Goldman spokesperson, said in an emailed statement, using abbreviations to describe the businesses of asset and wealth management and global banking and markets. \"Our AWM business is exceeding its targets and delivering record management fees and our GBM business is taking market and wallet share from peers.\"\u00a0Many of the people who spoke with Insider pointed to the asset- and wealth-management division as a prime example of a unit that had suffered from Solomon's unorthodox leadership choices.In September 2020, Solomon merged Goldman's mutual fund and third-party alternatives business with its in-house private-equity business, known as the merchant-banking division, to create one large asset-management division. He named Eric Lane and Julian Salisbury to run the combined business. While Lane had long run one of Goldman's divisions, Salisbury was a relative newcomer to the senior ranks. He was a talented investor who had only ever managed a team of several hundred people.\u00a0When Lane departed six months later in March 2021, it left Salisbury in charge of a division of about 5,000 people. It wasn't until the following January that Luke Sarsfield, an investment banker said to be close with Waldron, was named to cohead the division.\u00a0 Sarsfield also didn't have management or operations experience that would have prepared him to run a sprawling division.\u00a0When both men struggled, senior partners left, and Goldman stumbled in its efforts to wind down its balance-sheet investments. Salisbury and Sarsfield have both left the bank.Solomon has now tapped Marc Nachmann to run the asset-management business. Even Nachmann, known internally for his operational chops, is a stranger to the world of asset management, having spent most of his career as a banker, and then the past three years in the markets division. He's having to do a lot of learning on the job, two of the people said.\u00a0\"The asset-management business is one where all of these consultants, all of these clients, want longevity,\" one former partner said. \"They are frustrated with having the churn.\"Solomon addressed the turnover at the investor conference, saying: \"Whenever you put businesses together, there's going to be disruption and there's going to be volatility.\"The CEO said he's satisfied with the division's leadership and excited about its future.\"We think we're well positioned, and one of the things that gives us such confidence is the feedback from our clients about our offering, the mandates we're competing for and winning, gives us a lot of comfort that we have something unique that can be powerful and can grow over time,\" he said.Goldman recently won the right to manage two pensions holding \u00a323 billion, or about $28.5 billion, for the defense company BAE Systems.\u00a0Fratto said the asset-management division was \"exceeding its targets under Marc's leadership,\" adding that the firm promoted 11 investors to partner this year and hired another nine managing directors to invest on clients' behalf. Attrition is the lowest it has been in years, Goldman says.\u00a0Solomon took a similar managerial approach in naming an inexperienced executive when he selected Stephanie Cohen to corun the firm's consumer-banking division. Cohen also hadn't run a large division before, and people with direct knowledge of her leadership said they believed the division suffered as a result. After head count and expenses spiked in 2022, Solomon finally pulled the plug and ordered a large-scale retreat.\u00a0Now overseeing a much-scaled-down division called platform solutions, Cohen is on leave.Solomon \"has a big ego, is ambitious, and really wants to disrupt,\" one of the former partners said, adding: \"He wants to think out of the box and wants people who don't seem to make sense. He underestimated the pushback he would get from the people on the ground.\"There are other examples. Solomon chose as his chief legal officer, Kathy Ruemmler, President Barack Obama's White House counsel and a former Justice Department attorney who helped convict the Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. Hired as the head of regulatory affairs in 2020, Ruemmler became the firm's top lawyer the following year.\u00a0Unbeknown to Goldman's partners, Ruemmler held dozens of meetings with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the years before she joined Goldman, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. While Ruemmler disclosed the meetings before she was hired, a Goldman spokesperson told Bloomberg, her hiring in the face of that knowledge has left several people who spoke with Insider questioning Solomon's judgment \u2014 Ruemmler cochairs Goldman's reputational-risk committee.\u00a0\"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told the Journal.On Wall Street, one thing that can be counted on to ease personnel problems is pay. There's no question that Solomon disappointed on that front last year as the boom of mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings dried up.But now, the question raging among Goldman's highest earners is whether the 2022 bonus disappointment is part of a changing norm as Solomon adjusts how to spread the wealth in good times and in bad.Goldman Sachs partners are paid well by any standard: $950,000 in base salary and often multiples of that in annual bonuses. Bonuses were exceptional in 2021, thanks to a pandemic-fueled increase in trading and investment banking.\u00a0But last year felt very different to the people Insider spoke with. The discomfort started about midyear, when Solomon and Waldron started communicating compensation levels to managers in a way that made many people believe that something might have changed about their approach, four of the people said.\u00a0That was right around the time that losses were beginning to mount in Goldman's consumer bank, and it didn't take long for partners to put two and two together.\u00a0Though partners were long accustomed to working from the bottom up to figure out compensation levels, Solomon and Waldron last year imposed top-down figures that suggested they had little understanding of what each desk or business was paying its people, the people said.When managers looked at their teams and calculated the base salaries they were paying out and the bonuses they expected to pay to keep people, the two sides were far apart, two of the people told Insider. The money Goldman had set aside for compensation and benefits heading into the fourth quarter was over $3 billion less than in the prior year.\u00a0Managers pushed back on those top-line figures, and by the end of the year, Solomon and Waldron relented and topped up the compensation pool.The adjustment increased the compensation ratio to 32% for the year, compared with 30% the prior two years, and resulted in fourth-quarter results that, one analyst said, were \"even more miserable than anticipated.\"But by then, three former partners that Insider spoke with said they had come to believe that Solomon was inclined to reward shareholders at the expense of employees. After all, Solomon had become CEO in late 2018 with a mandate to bring more corporate accountability to a company that had been run as a private partnership before going public in 1999.It was a clear signal to them, in other words, that the way Goldman had traditionally paid its people \u2014 for example, by paying investment bankers to maintain relationships even during years when dealmaking was slow \u2014 had fundamentally changed.\u00a0Fratto, the spokesperson, disputed that interpretation, saying: \"The process for compensation did not change at all. Business heads fight for compensation for their people every single year. The only thing that changed in 2022 was that it was a relative down year off a record high in 2021.\"\u00a0Current partners are now looking to the 2023 compensation cycle for signs that Solomon still has their interests in mind. If it's another year like 2022, some people fear there will be another wave of exits.\u00a0\"A decade-high decline in comp in 2022 probably caused a degree of extra concern on the part of some employees,\" Mayo wrote in his September 18 report. He added that he worried that Goldman \"could feel a need to transfer more wealth from shareholders to employees to placate any potential situation.\"What's not in dispute is that Solomon and Waldron have less flexibility when it comes to paying people because of how large Goldman's staff has become.Last year, for example, pay and benefits fell 15%, while its staff rose 10%.Over the four years through 2022, head count ballooned 33%, to 48,500 from 36,600. Many people who have been hired in technology or consumer-banking roles get a higher percentage of their compensation in base salary. That's the opposite for investment bankers and traders, who get a larger portion of their compensation in variable bonuses.\u00a0\"It was a massive ballooning of head count to support the consumer and tech build-out,\" one of the people said, citing Goldman's expansion in lower-cost locations such as Texas. \"Those are people in Plano making $100,000 a year, so there is not a lot of variability.\"Solomon has begun to reverse the head-count trend, firing 3,200 people earlier this year to bring the increase during his tenure to 21%.\u00a0One of the people who spoke with Insider described the shift in compensation structure more simply: \"If you have a blowout year, you pay top performers very well. You don't need to use those discretionary dollars on the people who have more of a fixed compensation scheme. It works in reverse, too, so you can't pay top performers very well in down years.\"Fratto disputed that characterization, saying: \"This makes no sense for Goldman Sachs compensation structure or decision making.\"That increase in head count has brought additional bureaucracy, some of the people said. Solomon, to his credit, according to one person who spoke with Insider, has sought to eliminate red tape wherever he can, for example, by encouraging partners to call or text him directly rather than going through assistants.\u00a0But for investment bankers, traders, and portfolio managers who like to do deals, their reality is that a significantly larger firm\u00a0is in danger of becoming unwieldy. Partners' roles are now taken up with more paperwork than some of them would like, three of the people said.\u00a0The pressures of more people are going to increase as Goldman ramps up hiring in the wake of increased scrutiny from the Federal Reserve.Bloomberg reported last month that Goldman was hiring for several hundred back-office roles to help address the Fed's concerns, but the people who spoke with Insider said it might take months, if not longer, for Goldman to shake the Fed's scrutiny.\u00a0While most banks face regular scrutiny from their regulators, some of the people said the focus on Goldman is at least partly driven by Solomon's headlong push into consumer banking, a highly regulated industry.\"The Fed is all over us,\" one person said. \"And David doesn't want to acknowledge it's all driven by the consumer business.\"In 2022, Solomon publicly acknowledged that Goldman's consumer ambitions were costing the company too much money. He has been scaling them back ever since. Late last month, for example, Goldman sold off a business it had acquired when it bought United Capital Financial Partners for $750 million in 2019.\u00a0The bank is also now selling its GreenSky point-of-sale financing business. Yet the acquisition, which Goldman made in 2021 for $2.2 billion, still rankles Goldmanites. The deal never made sense to many people inside Goldman, especially those in its investment-banking division who had spent their careers advising corporate executives on takeover targets.\u00a0With GreenSky, Goldman took a financial-technology firm valued at a high multiple that used other banks' funding and turned it into a business dependent on Goldman's balance sheet with a lower multiple.It's not just internal people who have noticed. One former partner who spoke with Insider said that in calling on clients, people had had to answer for Goldman's consumer-banking missteps.\u00a0\"It's kind of embarrassing when you are showing up to a client pitching for M&A business, position yourself as the best M&A advisor, pointing to these credentials, and our own deals have been an absolute mess,\" the person said. \"The number of jokes clients make, and there is some truth, why hire you to do M&A if you can't even do your own M&A.\"\u00a0\u00a0Fratto noted that Goldman had been ranked No. 1 in M&A advisory for 20 years running, adding that the firm's consumer troubles were mostly behind it.\"We began narrowing our consumer ambitions nearly a year ago, have been executing on that strategy ever since, and the market has reacted positively,\" he said.\u00a0Goldman has said that much of the bad press surrounding the CEO has come from former partners who disagree with the firm's direction, with Fratto saying it's \"not surprising\" that many of Insider's sources were \"disgruntled former employees.\"\u00a0Even so, Solomon apparently believes that if he can win back the former partners, some of the noise will die down, one of the former partners said.\u00a0To that end, Solomon has gone on offense, charging Alison Mass, the chair of investment banking, with leading the office of alumni engagement and winning back the hearts and minds of the partnership. Over the past several months, Mass has hosted numerous dinners and get-togethers for former partners, in places including London, Paris, and Chicago, where Solomon and former CEO and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson spoke to a group of ex-partners.\"He is on a campaign to reconnect with the ex-partners,\" one person who saw Solomon at one of the alumni events said. \"If he can get them to back off and get them to be supportive, that will help.\"Solomon has also wooed partners at his Wooster Street apartment in lower Manhattan.Last month, Solomon brought a respected former partner, Russell Horwitz, back into the fold by hiring him as the firm's chief of staff. Several of the former partners who spoke with Insider supported that move.The stakes are high as Solomon faces the biggest test of his five-year stint.\u00a0The company's board met earlier this month when firmwide succession planning was high on the discussion list. And the bank is set to report third-quarter earnings next month. Ryan, the JMP analyst, said he expected quarterly revenue of $12.4 billion, which would be the most in six quarters.\u00a0\u00a0If Solomon can put up better numbers, and weather the media storm around partner exits and his personality, the CEO may outlast his critics.Mayo agrees, writing after his meeting with Ogunlesi that \"our conclusion is that the CEO is not going anywhere anytime soon,\" based in part on his belief that the \"board is in anything but caretaker mode, as reflected by the engagement of the lead director.\"That means Solomon still has time to cement his legacy.\u00a0\"The people that are really unhappy with the way that David has run the firm are being flushed out, they are cutting their ties with the firm, and they are deciding it's not the place it used to be,\" one of the former partners said. \"The people who are left behind are those who are in support. It's a watershed moment.\"Emmalyse Brownstein contributed reporting.","label":"Finance, BI Prime, Goldman Sachs, Wall Street","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-ceo-partners-departures-strategy-2023-9"},"28":{"index":28,"title":"American Express CEO Works 17 Hours a Day: Here's His Schedule","date":1695152456000,"content":"The CEO of American Express has 17-hour work days \u2014 and they include eating a Chopt salad for lunch at his desk each afternoon, and spending three hours each night answering customer emails.CEO Steve Squeri leaves home within 15 minutes of waking up at 5:45 a.m., and works in the car on his way to the office, the Financial Times reported.

In some cases, we receive a commission from our partners; however, our opinions are our own. Terms apply to offers listed on this page.One of the perks that come with most Amex Delta co-branded credit cards is a free checked bag for the cardholder and up to eight travel companions on the same reservation when flying Delta.Six Delta credit cards offer this benefit:For travelers who check bags often, the savings can add up quickly. Delta charges $30 each way for a checked bag on a domestic flight. For a family of four taking a long vacation, just having the credit card can help save $240 \u2014 $30 each bag, each way would mean a total of $240 for the whole family.Here's how to make sure you get your free checked bag as a Delta credit card holder.We're focused here on the rewards and perks that come with each card. These cards won't be worth it if you're paying interest or late fees.

It has a modest annual fee so it's worth it even if you only fly the airline occasionally.When you apply for a Delta Amex card, you'll be prompted to enter your Delta SkyMiles number (if you don't have one, it's free to join). From that point on, as long as the card is open, the benefits are tied to your SkyMiles account.There is no requirement to use your Delta card to pay for your ticket (or the taxes and fees on an award ticket) to receive your first checked bag free.Just make sure that you're logged in to your Delta account when booking tickets \u2014 or, if you're booking through a third-party portal like Expedia, just enter your Delta frequent flyer number during the booking process. If you go to add a bag when checking in for your flight, you'll see a cost of $0. The same will apply to up to eight passengers on the same reservation as you.The key is making sure that you're on the same reservation. If you book separately, your travel companions won't have access to free checked bags unless they have their own Delta credit card (or hold elite Medallion status).\u00a0There's no limit to the number of times you can use the free checked bag benefit, so cardholders who fly Delta frequently can get a value that far exceeds the card's annual fee with this perk.The only Amex Delta credit card that doesn't offer a free checked bag is the no-annual-fee Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Blue American Express Card.

However, if an authorized user is traveling on the same reservation as the primary cardholder, they'll be eligible for the free bag.The free checked bag benefit only applies to normal bags. If your bag is overweight or oversized, you'll still have to pay the appropriate fee.If you forget to add your SkyMiles number when you booked your reservation, all is not lost. You can add your frequent flyer number to your itinerary by going to the \"My Trips\" section of the Delta website and searching for your reservation.Alternatively, you can call Delta reservations and have an agent add your SkyMiles number, but keep in mind that hold times these days can be very long.In economy class on flights in the US, Delta normally charges $30 for the first checked bag, as long as it's not oversize or overweight. To qualify for a free checked bag from your Delta credit card, your bag must weigh under 50 pounds and not exceed 62 inches when you total length + width + height.\u00a0If you have a second bag to check, you'll be charged a fee of $40 (assuming it's not oversize\/overweight).\u00a0Other Delta baggage fees vary by route and class of service.

And as banks \u2014 those big old traditional lenders\u00a0\u2014 have had a year of turmoil, private money managers have stepped in, effectively positioned as banks without the same regulation.\u00a0\"This is a great time for private credit. This is not a quarter that's a great time for private credit; this is a secular change,\" Apollo CEO Marc Rowan said last month. \"Today we are seeing the best risk-reward opportunities we have ever seen in direct lending,\" Blue Owl co-CEO Marc Lipschultz told Insider last December. Goldman Sachs research analysts told clients in June that they view private credit as \"one of the most interesting growth themes within capital markets over the next several years.\"So it's no wonder that through the past couple of years, working on and around private credit deals has become Wall Street's career du jour. Private investment firms often hire from their competitors and investment banks, said Paul Heller, managing partner and co-leader of search firm Caldwell's financial services practice.\u00a0\"If I were to advertise an executive role in a private credit fund and an executive role in a bulge-bracket bank, the credit fund's applications would be three times, four times that of the bank,\" said Hannah Robb, associate partner at New York-based search firm Eastward Partners. And more people are touting their work in the space; the number of LinkedIn users globally listing \"private credit\" as a skill is up 131% in the past year, according to the website.In a \"perception matrix,\" private credit is viewed more favorably than banking roles, Robb said. \"It's considered the most interesting, largely because money talks and the returns are there.\" From 2005 to 2022, direct lending strategies measured by consultant Cliffwater reflect a 9% return while Bloomberg's high-yield bond and aggregate bond indices show returns of 6% and 3%, respectively, in the same time.\u00a0While private credit has been booming, the same investment firms launching funds are offering eye-watering pay packages for restructuring experts to help in an eventual downturn.Private credit is a $1.5 trillion market (including both assets and cash that investors haven't yet deployed), up from $500 billion in 2010. Private credit is most often floating-rate debt \u2014 that is, debt where interest rates rise in concert with rate hikes. Asset managers large and niche are profiting from central banks' historic path of policy tightening while the businesses they lend to risk struggling under the weight of higher interest payments in a slowing economy.\"These markets are weird, and there's a tremendous amount of chaos in private credit. There are many firms trying to raise capital,\" Heller of Caldwell said. \"There is a lot of attention on retail investors allocating money to the space. So there's a little bit of a talent frenzy at the moment.\"\u00a0It's worth noting what private credit is: we're talking about debt and loans. This is not exactly new or tantalizing stuff. But who is lending out money, and who is becoming more powerful as a result, has shifted in recent years.\u00a0Banks have broadly pulled back on making risky loans since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, benefiting private investment managers like Ares, Apollo, Carlyle, and Blackstone.\u00a0Marco Acerra, a financial services-focused consultant at the search firm Spencer Stuart, said it's been the case in past down cycles that banks retrench and alternative capital fills in the gap. \"I see this as a normal continuation of that trend, except we have been in a low interest-rate environment for such a long time that it feels particularly pronounced,\" Acerra said.And people want in. Last week, the CFA Institute said it was adding a new private markets and alternative investments certificate that includes a course on private credit to meet growing demand among members. Private credit strategies like direct lending (which makes up the larget portion of private credit assets), mezzanine capital, and asset-backed lending demand specialized skill sets, noted Richard Fernand, head of certificate management at the CFA Institute.\u00a0Some business schools are seeing a subtle shift in where students are going. Nicholas Kalogeropoulos, senior associate director of employee relations for Columbia Business School, said there has been a steady increase in interest from firms seeking to recruit the school's students for private credit positions in the past few years, though this is from a very small base as the space is nascent and private credit has not historically targeted MBAs.Even by Wall Street standards, the private credit market is commanding large paydays, a theme magnified while firms increasingly seek out people specializing in restructuring for portfolio companies gone bad.\u00a0In demand, too, are private credit-focused investor relations roles, with competitive pay packages to match, said Sam Iles, executive director and cohead of distribution at asset management consultancy Alpha FMC. Acerra of Spencer Stuart said he isn't hearing much demand from candidates necessarily choosing between banking and private credit roles at the executive level, where his team is active. But at junior levels, he senses that \"banks are losing high-quality junior bankers to private credit roles, as opposed to the traditional buyout roles they might otherwise have favored.\"Robb of Eastward said that for private credit funds seeking workout talent in the past year, \"I've negotiated packages that are more than $2 million, guaranteed for multiple years, which is somewhat unheard of.\"The demand for private credit extends to the attorneys these firms hire.\"For most of my career, attracting new attorneys to private credit was a challenge. They didn't quite know what it was, were concerned about committing long-term, or oftentimes, viewed finance as a boring practice area,\" said Mike Mezzacappa, partner and cohead of private credit at the law firm Proskauer. Proskauer's private credit group now has 90 lawyers, 24 of whom are partners, working full-time on private credit. Evan Palenschat, a newer partner in the group, noted that more firms are starting to brand practices as \"private credit\" or \"direct lending.\"\u00a0The industry is grappling with what rising rates mean for the companies they have invested in, both on the debt and equity sides, including monitoring defaults.Last week, KKR's chief financial officer, Robert Lewin, said default rates are ticking up, though they are below their 10-year rolling averages. \"Relative to expectations, I think it has been better across the board,\" he said at a conference hosted by Barclays. Goldman Sachs research analysts noted in a June report that Moody's forecasts the loan default rate to increase to a peak of 6% next year from 1.5% in the last two years.Acerra of Spencer Stuart said default risks broadly are \"somewhat tempered,\" pointing to firms creating custom agreements with portfolio companies, known as covenants, to protect against default.\u00a0\"That said, I expect more private credit lenders will need to be set up to handle restructurings and workouts in-house, which is a trend that we expect will accelerate,\" Acerra said.\u00a0Private credit is an attractive career for people in financial services in part because \"banks naturally have more capital constraints and private credit firms are not regulated in the same way,\" Heller of Caldwell said. \"But at some point, the market can saturate.\"","label":"Finance, BI Prime, Finance, Asset Management, Wall Street","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/wall-street-private-credit-careers-asset-management-2023-9"},"32":{"index":32,"title":"I Make the Impossible Possible for Some of America's Richest People","date":1694962046000,"content":"This is an as-told-to essay based on a transcribed conversation with Rey Flemings, 50, the founder and CEO of community and concierge service app Myria. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I created Myria, a community and concierge for ultra-high-net-worth individuals in 2021. It works in two ways. There's a community for members to connect with one another through our app, and there's an access side where they can get off-market luxury experiences.From my time working with big celebrities, I've learned that A-list celebrities have access that the rich don't.\u00a0\u00a0We are highly selective about who our members are and what their personal profile looks like.\u00a0Membership starts at $30,000 per person per year. Myria has 35 members, but we plan to accept a further 85 by the end of this year.We have a waiting list of about 1,000 names, but we only let in small numbers at a time.Over half of our business is experiential \u2014 on things like travel and events.The remainder is more serious: staffing, hiring, security, professional services, and dealing with crises.The general rule of thumb for using Myria is that if your assistant can do it, then your assistant should do it. For everything else, call Myria.\u00a0Right before the world essentially shut down due to the pandemic, we threw a birthday party for a client's wife.The client is the CEO of a Fortune 100 company and wanted to go all out, so we hired around 100 people to work the event and got Pitbull to perform.We had it all filmed as a reality show that they could watch later.A level one request is easy \u2014 something anyone can do or likely can purchase online. Level five requests are all but impossible.\u00a0Let's say you wanted to get a VIP pass to Coachella, anyone with internet access and a credit card can buy that.A level two request could be someone wanting to attend an after-party at a fancy villa in Palm Springs or maybe booking a private jet.\u00a0Level three requests are off-market \u2014 things that you can't Google. For example, a backstage pass to Coachella with an all-access artist's credentials. They sell them but there's no website where you could go to find it.A level four request could be getting a backstage pass to Beyonce's headline performance.\u00a0But the vast majority of our business isn't celebrity-driven. People have very diverse interests.Before launching Myria, I set up and ran an offline concierge service called The Blue. Before that, I was CEO of Particle, which was sold to Apple in 2010.In the startup world, I met a lot of people who had built big fortunes and built relationships with them.I've helped produce events and taken care of the biggest celebrities in the world and some of the most prominent families on the planet, including the Justin Timberlake family office, which I've worked with for eight years.I came from not very much in Memphis, Tennessee. I attended a public junior high school, but my principal suggested I attend a private all-boys school, which happened to be one of the best in the southeastern US. It has a lot of renowned alumni, from the founder of FedEx to Paul Tudor Jones, one of the most famous option traders in history \u2014 so I was exposed to a world of wealth.\u00a0In the 1990s, my mentor asked me if I could make digital presentations for his financial services business to some wealthy families.Over the next four years I pitched hundreds of presentations to super-rich families and got an understanding of their concerns, who they were, and their interests. That experience was the best training ground that I could ever have and it has enabled me to be able to do what I do today.","label":"Careers, Finance, Tech","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/ultra-exclusive-concierge-app-myria-wealthy-clients-2023-9"},"33":{"index":33,"title":"Finance Execs in China Spend 30% of Working Day on 'Xi Thought,' Report Says","date":1695131593000,"content":"Employees of the global finance firm BlackRock, together with other bankers and business leaders in China, are said to be spending up to a third of their working time engaging in materials related to \"Xi Jinping Thought,\" per Bloomberg.Study sessions have now apparently become mandatory for many employees at non-state-owned companies, including foreign staff members at international firms.In June, some employees of the financial firms Franklin Templeton and BlackRock were ordered to attend a lecture on sticking to the party's leadership in the industry, Bloomberg reported. Some have reported having to join activities or courses, or read numerous books on the subject each month.First published in 2017, Xi Jinping Thought lays out 14 principles by which China will prosper. It follows a pattern of Chinese leaders building on the original Marxist-Leninist teachings. Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin all introduced their own revised teachings on the theory that underpins China's communist political system.But Beijing's promotion of the doctrine fits into the shift towards prioritising ideology to maintain the party's grip on power as economic pressures have mounted.In addition to the pressure to study of Xi's doctrine, new laws have limited international banks' abilities to operate as normal in China.Amendments to the country's counter-espionage laws have hindered typical business practices including gathering information on local markets, potential partners, and competitors, as well as making accurate reporting to investors and regulators more difficult by cutting access to certain sources of information to non-local businesses.In March, Deloitte was fined $31 million after an official investigation found \"serious deficiencies\" in its audit of a state-owned debt management firm, per the Financial Times.Meanwhile, China's foreign relations law makes clear that foreign nationals will not be exempt from China's increasing control over private business. \"Foreigners and foreign organisations in mainland China shall comply with Chinese law and must not endanger China's national security, harm the societal public interest, or undermine societal public order,'\" the law states, per the Financial Times.\u00a0Correction: September 19, 2023 \u2014 An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Xi Jinping.","label":"Finance, China","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/blackrock-execs-in-china-ordered-spend-working-day-xi-thought-2023-9"},"34":{"index":34,"title":"Meet Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, World's Richest Woman Worth $87B","date":1694863480000,"content":"Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, the 70-year-old granddaughter of L'Oreal founder Eug\u00e8ne Schueller, is the richest woman in the world, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\u00a0Bettencourt Meyers is worth almost $88 billion, mostly due to her stake in L'Oreal.

Blank leads Connect Ventures, an investment partnership between the agency and VC firm NEA that led a recent $20 million investment in Deep Voodoo \u2014 which was previously funded entirely by Park County, \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's production company.\u00a0\"I think Hollywood's going to be leading because the companies that rise to the top will be the ones that can work at the highest quality bar,\" Blank added.To be sure, Hollywood creative stakeholders share the broader concerns about generative AI taking people's jobs and stealing artists' content. AI has been a key issue in the Writers Guild of America's strike against the studios as film and TV writers seek guardrails on its use in generating content. The actors' guild, SAG-AFTRA, has battled over the issue in contract negotiations, while the Directors Guild of America reached a tentative agreement acknowledging that \"AI is not a person.\"There are also worries about the nascent technology being used to deceive viewers and exploit actors.There are already AI tools that can write full scripts. Down the road, people working in AI predict it will be used to create entire movie characters and scores and to personalize video game experiences.\u00a0\"All elements of how you make content will be influenced by generative AI \u2014 generating parts of faces, backgrounds,\" said Thomas Graham, CEO of Metaphysic, a London-based AI startup known for its Tom Cruise deepfakes. \"Over 10, 15 years, it'll touch every part of content creation.\"Vendors and investors told Insider that over time, AI tools will change jobs, not replace them. Chatbot-written scripts aren't ready for primetime \u2014\u00a0at least not yet. And in bringing down the cost of production, the argument goes, AI will ultimately create more jobs by freeing up funding for more projects.\u00a0\"We've taken clients to experience this firsthand and a number of times, the response has been, there's a movie I've always wanted to make that I didn't think was possible because of the technology, and now I know it is,\" Blank said of deepfake technology.Insider scouted 12 AI-centered companies that have raised capital in recent years, listed in alphabetical order.

The average price return for an NBA team, for example, was 1,057% from 2002 to 2021, per PitchBook.Now rich individuals have to compete with institutional investors like private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds for a limited number of teams. As a result, aspiring team owners have gotten more creative to seal the deal.Many are joining forces in order to amass enough cash for a controlling stake. Actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, for instance, bought Welsh minor-league soccer club Wrexham AFC for $2.5 million in 2021. Less popular sports, such as pickleball, are also drawing investors, with LeBron James buying a team this past October.Even billionaires are looking overseas for opportunities, such as former co-owner of the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks Marc Lasry, who is eyeing African and Asian basketball teams.Goldman Sachs, which has worked on a number of high-profile sports deals like financing the stadium for the\u00a0National Football League's Tennessee Titans, is helping its wealthy clients get a piece of the action. On the back of demand for \"the rapid increase in capital\" looking to invest in the sports industry, the bank is creating a new unit of sports dealmakers, Goldman Sachs announced in a memo Friday. The new team aims to work with its wealth business to pitch investments in sports teams and stadiums to its rich clients.These trends are likely to continue as valuations show no sign of cooling off, according to Brian Kantarian, head of sports finance in JPMorgan's private bank. A controlling stake in a NFL team requires at least $2 billion of cash equity, he told Insider. Apollo cofounder Josh Harris bought the NFL's Washington Commanders for a record-breaking $6.05 billion this summer.\"Some of what's driving interest towards these more nascent leagues is that the entry point is achievable, especially if you want to have a say in club operations and be any kind of decision-maker,\" Kantarian told Insider.Professional sports are viewed by many as a recession-proof investment. Even when discretionary income drops, some consumers continue to go to games in order to take their minds off their troubles, Kantarian said.\"Sports, given the passion aspect of it, will continue to play an important role in people's lives,\" he said.\u00a0Much of this resilience can be credited to the rising value of media rights, according to Ivo Voynov, who leads sport finance for Citi Private Bank.He has observed that newer investors, whether their backgrounds are in tech or private equity, have brought a new sophistication to sports team ownership. Due to the rising costs of controlling stakes, many have formed syndicates of other high-net-worth limited partners to buy teams.\"It's brought this sense of building up real companies around these assets that used to be thought of as nice-to-have trophy assets that you could talk about at cocktail parties,\" he told Insider.American investors are also becoming more dominant in European soccer leagues, according to Voynov. More than a third of clubs in Europe's Big Five soccer leagues are backed by US investors, including private equity firms and high-net-worth investors, according to PitchBook.\"The perception is that there are a lot of inefficiencies in the way clubs are run there, and then potentially you could bring in some of the lessons learned in the US to Europe and improve operations, whether its data and analytics,\" he said.Plenty of investors have no attachment to their franchises before inking the deal.\"I think it's my biggest competitive advantage that I don't get emotionally attached,\" RedBird Capital CEO Gerry Cardinale told Insider in December. \"They're all pieces of intellectual property that have a legitimate right to be monetized as long as they balance the fan-social contract at the same time.\"But most team owners often become personally invested, according to Kantarian and Voynov.\"A lot of the owners we work with, they may have initially approached the investment looking at the metrics and the financials and the growth rates, but they get in the owner's seat and suddenly they want to win,\" Kantarian told Insider.Despite the flurry of M&A activity, the number of sports teams is largely static. Starting a new league is risky and expensive. The XFL, a spring football league, is on its third try after first launching two decades ago.Advising on deals in European soccer has proved to be big business for Wall Street banks. But banks have limited interest when it comes to emerging sports like pickleball. JPMorgan, for instance, generally does not finance debt if the league involved is less than 10 years old, Kantarian said. The bank also considers the existing owners involved and whether they are current clients or prospective ones.These investments are also typically regarded as evergreen investments, Voynov said.\"It's never going to be a private equity type of model where these assets will be exited every five years,\" he told Insider. \"You're becoming part of the community so it's not as easy to extricate yourself in those scenarios.\"","label":"Finance, BI Prime, Investing, Billionaires, Private Equity","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/rich-sports-team-owners-investing-private-equity-2023-9"},"37":{"index":37,"title":"David Marcus Lays Out Why Meta's Crypto Plans Failed and How That Influenced His New Startup","date":1695304699000,"content":"After years of pie-in-the-sky dreams and pitches, crypto founders have become more realistic.Perhaps that's because of the market \u2014 investors are more willing to suspend disbelief when rates are low \u2014 or thanks to the industry's well-known bad actors, but either way, those remaining are no longer promising to take over the world.David Marcus is a good example.The one-time president of PayPal was the head of the failed stablecoin project at Facebook, now Meta, which was known as Libra and Diem at different points in its short existence. With an ultimate goal to be the go-to currency for the global financial system, it was, in hindsight, too ambitious, Marcus admits now.Speaking to reporters at Andreessen Horowitz's downtown Manhattan office, he explained how they were too \"idealistic\" with their original idea.\"If you're dependent on one centralized stablecoin to do global payments, it's a problem as we've experienced firsthand,\" he said.Now, his new startup Lightspark is working within the system \u2014 building on top of Bitcoin to connect, but not replace, governments and their local currencies. Investors, including well-known venture shops like a16z and Paradigm, have poured $175 million into the new company already.In 2019 Meta unveiled plans to create a digital currency pegged to hard currencies including the US dollar. The idea was that people using Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp would be able to send cryptocurrency seamlessly around the world, which could later be be changed for local currencies.Libra's goal to make \"everyone happy and it'll be wonderful and everyone will agree,\" Marcus said, couldn't mesh with political realities.\"You don't want a private company to become massive in controlling the unit of account and managing reserves at a single point of failure,\" Marcus said.\"If you depeg and it's a centralized company that's managed privately, governments really don't like that \u2014 they want to be in control of their unit of account, they want to be in control of their currency.\"The project was zealous, even for pie-in-the-sky crypto standards. Massive payment companies like Visa, regulators across the globe including the Securities and Exchange Commission, and politicians were going to have to work together and approve a radical transformation of global financial policy that was coming from a company known for scandal after scandal tied to user data and privacy.Even Mark Zuckerberg admitted in his testimony to Congress on the project that his company might not be the \"ideal messenger\" for Libra. Regulatory roadblocks and concerns over Facebook's data privacy eventually stalled the project.While Marcus is best known for his time spent at PayPal and Meta, he's founded three companies that went on to be bought by competitors.When he announced in a tweet in November 2021 that he was leaving Meta he added: \"my entrepreneurial DNA has been nudging me for too many mornings in a row to continue ignoring it.\"With his new startup, Lightspark, Marcus plans to hypercharge the global payments system is simpler, or at least less grandiose.Users will swap their local currency for bitcoin and then have it converted to the local currency of whichever country the capital is needed in. Marcus likens it to a software-as-a-service company; it makes revenue on transaction fees.The Los Angeles-based company uses bitcoin as its \"neutral internet money\" for several reasons, mainly its liquidity and the regulatory clarity governments have provided on the digital currency. Plus, it is not tied to one particular country so there is less geopolitical mistrust.Lightspark is using the best part of the crypto industry's progress, said Christian Catalini, Marcus's cofounder who previously worked at Facebook with him.\"The most valuable thing that's been built has been the connection to legacy systems,\" he said. Given bitcoin's popularity around the world, exchanges in far-flung locales have the ability to transfer it to local currencies. It's an area that JPMorgan is reportedly looking at too. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Wall Street bank was exploring a blockchain-based deposit token for faster cross-border payments and settlements.Marcus and Catalini have signed up different exchanges like Bahrain-based Rain and crypto wallets and are hoping to have the first currency transfers go through later this year. Next year, Marcus said, the firm hopes to \"seriously ramp it up.\"\"Money is the last thing that doesn't move over the internet.\"","label":"Finance, Finance, Wall Street, Meta","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/david-marcus-failed-facebook-meta-stablecoin-plans-new-startup-lightspark-2023-9"},"38":{"index":38,"title":"Deutsche Bank to Launch Gen AI Tools and Hire Hundreds of Engineers","date":1694709116000,"content":"A handful of men clustered around a structure of half a dozen computer screens erected overhead. They stood face-to-face with what could be the future of banking.\u00a0With a touchscreen pre-populated with questions in front of them, they queried the machine about the performance and ESG strategy of a fictitious company called Cymbal. Line graphs, bar charts, company reports, and stock charts whirled across the screens. Then they cut to black before text came into focus to provide intel on Cymbal, a hypothetical corporate client of Deutsche Bank.The tool presented a client briefing, a report to prep investment bankers before client meetings. Thanks to generative AI, what would usually take a team of junior bankers a day or two to put together was produced in seconds.The German bank's interest in the buzzy technology was fully displayed at Google Cloud Next 2023 in San Francisco in late August. Live demos of genAI tools drove a steady stream of admirers as they experimented with souped-up chatbots that could change language mid-conversation, dashboards that brainstormed potential clients, and a new way to generate software code.Generative AI has become all the rage on the Street since the splashy debut of ChatGPT. For all of Wall Street's interest and investment in generative AI, many are still exploring applications of the technology.Deutsche Bank is aiming to transform the business and work of banking. The firm is running about 25 pilots, with many experiments going live in early 2024. It is looking to double or triple its AI-related workforce in the next year and retrain existing front- and back-office employees as the technology permeates DB's ranks, from HR to tech to the investment bank. But it will also be a trusting moment for the bank, with a minefield of unknowns, including future costs, evolving regulations, and a talent war that's heating up.\u00a0\"On generative AI, it's like net new. There are no benchmarks. There's a lot of assumptions,\" Gil Perez, Deutsche Bank's chief innovation officer, told Insider.\"You need to basically get people to do a bit of a leap of faith and say, 'Yes, I understand that we don't have all of the details, but we will get there.' And that's really difficult for a lot of boardrooms, a lot of CFOs,\" Perez said.Deutsche Bank has been establishing its AI strategy since 2021, a year after the bank pivoted to the public cloud, forming a partnership with Google Cloud. A centralized AI team with less than 100 technologists builds core AI capabilities.\u00a0The bank is aggressively hiring more technologists to build out its AI empire. In total, between 300 to 400 technologists are working on all of Deutsche's AI projects. Perez said the bank will at least double, maybe even triple, the size of the team in the next 12 months.A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined to comment on the amount it is investing in its AI efforts.What's unique about the bank's approach is that it is being driven by about 13 chief operating officers who span the firm and suggest ideas for how to improve their business lines through tech.\u00a0With the business driving the momentum behind Deutsche's AI ambitions, technology is being developed at an unprecedented speed. Usually, tech needs to convince the business to allocate budget before a new capability or tool can be developed \u2014 and that's usually met with pushback about years' long product roadmaps, Perez said.\u00a0But with ideas generated by the businesses themselves, tech teams get the green flag to move quicker.\"The analogy is that we're not pushing any more, we're being pushed,\" Perez said.By as early as January, a day in the life of a Deutsche banker could look very different. The corporate bank, which drew in 1.6 billion euros, or more than $2 billion, in revenue in the second quarter, serves Deutsche's institutional clients, financial services firms, and investors.\u00a0The division has been a hotbed of experimentation ever since February, and many of the use cases are targeted at improving time-consuming processes usually shouldered by junior ranks.\u00a0The pilot that was on display at the Google event produced a client briefing with the touch of a few keystrokes.\u00a0The time saved will allow junior bankers to spend more time critically thinking about the client, headwinds within their industry, or something a client isn't doing that its competitors are, Tamara Bitticks, vice chair within the corporate bank, told Insider. Bankers can focus on building people skills, like building trust, reading the room, and being a good listener, she added.\u00a0\"What I struggle with our juniors a lot of times is they're gathering the information, and they're so consumed with the gathering that they don't think about the analyzing,\" Bitticks said.\u00a0\"It will be a new way of being a banker,\" she said.Deutsche is currently piloting a genAI chatbot to serve corporate and investment banking clients. It has the ability to answer complex questions, like if a client needs to update account signatories, the chatbot could provide the total number of accounts a client has where a specific person is a signatory or authorizer.The bank has plans to launch the chatbot in the first quarter of 2024. It's testing it on a sampling of everyday customers and internally for HR employees. Reusability of these so-called core platforms will be a core piece of how Deutsche scales its AI capabilities, Perez said.Deutsche Bank's genAI journey won't be easy to pull off.\u00a0The bank will need to compete for in-demand AI tech talent, a market that is only set to heat up. And it will need to establish retraining and upskilling programs for existing employees across the firm, not just the developers building the tech.\u00a0\"We are going to ensure that people understand that you now have somebody that helps you, just like a personal assistant helps you and does something for you, but at the end of the day you need to take responsibility,\" he said.\u00a0There's also a gap between regulatory acceptance and generative AI. Red tape is a common source of frustration for many innovation and tech teams on Wall Street, but how Washington D.C. will regulate genAI has yet to be determined.\u00a0Determining the technology's return on investment will be another tricky unknown to navigate. Unlike other advancements, like the public cloud or mobile apps, finance firms don't have a precedent to stack themselves up against.\u00a0\"That makes the discussion in the boardroom when you're trying to quantify this a lot more difficult, a lot more challenging,\" Perez said.\u00a0And the pricing of these compute-intensive genAI applications could be 10 or 20 times once the pilots graduate and the tech is live, he said.\u00a0\"This is great, but what's going to be the return? How do we quantify it? What's going to be the benefit? The answer is we don't know,\" he said.","label":"Finance, BI Prime, AI, Generative AI","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/deutsche-bank-to-launch-generative-ai-tools-hire-hundreds-engineers-2023-9"},"39":{"index":39,"title":"They Bought a Piece of a Dream Home.

Crowdfunding had popped up in the wake of the financial crisis that made Burry's name, offering the promise of private-equity-style returns to smaller investors.\"What happened in the crisis is there was practically no underwriting,\" Burry was quoted as saying at the time. \"It's important for the next-generation alternative lending model that there be controls in place. There's somebody at the door checking for excess credit risk.\"Just eight years and $121.9 million in funding later, including from the Silicon Valley behemoth Andreessen Horowitz, Burry's optimism was proved wrong. PeerStreet and its affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 26 after its lending business dropped to $5.4 million in mortgage originations, down from $695 million in 2021.PeerStreet blamed its collapse on plummeting demand amid rising rates. But the bankruptcy documents show the empty promises of real-estate crowdfunding, which rose from the ashes of the global financial crisis, to \"democratize\" real-estate investing and give the little guy a chance at the spoils previously enjoyed only by the fabulously wealthy. With the help of hundreds of millions in venture capital, this pocket of investing morphed into a $14 billion industry by 2022, anchored by major companies such as Yieldstreet, CrowdStreet, and, for a time, Fundrise.Insider pored over hundreds of court filings, spoke with bankruptcy and crowdfunding experts, and interviewed six PeerStreet investors and one former employee to find out what went wrong. We found that most of the company's loans were \"nonperforming,\" indicating that the majority of PeerStreet's investors loaned money to borrowers who've stopped paying them back.\u00a0More importantly, many PeerStreet investors who thought they were purchasing a slice of a loan in a property have learned that they did no such thing, at least according to the company. PeerStreet has told a Delaware federal bankruptcy-court judge that it sold financial instruments that acted as fractions of mortgages instead of mortgages themselves, giving the company the right to sell the loans in bankruptcy.The question of ownership is before Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein. Depending on how she rules, many PeerStreet investors stand to lose much of their investment \u2014 raising questions about the viability of the real-estate-crowdfunding business model for Main Street investors.PeerStreet CEO Brew Johnson told Insider he's \"unable to comment at this time.\"A ruling in favor of PeerStreet \"will break people's trust in the crowdfunding platforms as a whole,\" Braun Mincher, a PeerStreet investor, told Insider.Like many PeerStreet investors who spoke with Insider, Mincher has a strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He's a tech entrepreneur who has successfully exited multiple businesses and has experience as both a buyer of real estate and a direct lender to real-estate projects. He is a founding shareholder of a $250 million community bank and served as the head of the committee of creditors in another Delaware bankruptcy case. He even wrote a book on personal finance.Yet the extent of the prospective losses stemming from PeerStreet's bankruptcy has taken even sophisticated investors such as him by surprise.\u00a0\"I feel that I'm savvy, but I feel duped by what they're trying to do here,\" Mincher said, echoing language filed in letters to the court, including one from a noteholder who said they felt like the \"victim of an investing scam.\"Crowdfunding took hold in the age of social media, with the pioneer LendingClub getting its start on Facebook in 2007. The concept is simple: Instead of requiring someone with a business plan \u2014 be it a startup, a product, or a real-estate investment \u2014 to go to a bank or large investor for cash to get their idea off the ground, the investment can be collectively funded by small investors.\u00a0The most well-known version is reward crowdfunding, most commonly seen on Kickstarter, where someone with an idea for a gadget asks for startup money and then provides these early investors with a reward, usually the product itself, once it's created.Another form of crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding, works a bit like the stock market without the onerous and expensive process of initial public offerings. An asset, be it a company, a piece of real estate, or even an expensive artwork, is split into shares. Small-time investors can then purchase a share of the asset and split the spoils.In the case of PeerStreet, investors purchase a note that operates like a mortgage tied to (in most cases) a residential investment property. As long as the property owner can pay the mortgage, the investor gets a monthly payout proportional to their share.Launched in 2013, PeerStreet quickly grew a stellar reputation among the burgeoning crowdfunding community, but the quality of deals on the platform noticeably declined as its popularity grew, said Ian Ippolito, the founder of the Real Estate Crowdfunding Review, a website that researches real-estate crowdfunding platforms.According to Ippolito, it's a common story: A crowdfunding company grows in popularity to the point where deals are fully funded in 30 minutes or less, prompting it to increase the number of deals on the platform. Skyrocketing demand for deals comes with \"a temptation to reduce the underwriting,\" he said.\u00a0PeerStreet didn't respond to requests for comment, but its executives have made no bones about its ambition to function as a \"two-sided marketplace,\" instead of as an investment manager. Marketplaces, which merely connect buyers to sellers, do better as more volume flows through them, which means the incentive is for more investments, not necessarily high-quality ones. This is true for many real-estate crowdfunders, whether they sell notes attached to debt or shares of an equity investment.\"If you get up to a cruising altitude with a whole bunch of developers up there, it's impossible for them to do the due diligence,\" said John McNellis, a principal and cofounder of the development group McNellis Partners and an author of a best-selling book on real-estate development.He said the up-for-grabs investment pitch of many crowdfunding companies was: \"This is up on our website. It may or may not suck as an investment. Make your own decision.\"Perhaps not coincidentally, the rise in demand for deals often coincides with capital infusions from venture capitalists, further fueling the cycle and leading to even more deterioration in the underwriting standards, industry insiders including a former crowdfunding founder said.Burry was an early PeerStreet investor and vouched for the company's credit quality in 2015, when it was still in startup mode. By 2016, the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz was also backing the company. By 2019, PeerStreet had raised $121.9 million in venture funding and surpassed $3 billion in total loans funded. (It had hit the $2 billion benchmark only a year earlier after five years in business.) The company's meteoric growth continued amid the pandemic, but loan volume collapsed as interest rates rose.The collapse has revealed deeper issues, including a massive number of loans in or near default. A mind-boggling 54% of the company's loans were more than 30 days delinquent as of the bankruptcy, a fact pulled from court documents that drew gasps from industry insiders when discussing PeerStreet with Insider.Ippolito and McNellis said crowdfunding companies were never in line to get the best deals anyway because those tended to be reserved for the banks or institutional investors, which have higher underwriting standards. The focus on quantity exacerbated the situation, resulting in a flood of low-quality deals.\"They call it democratizing real estate. I call it shearing sheep,\" McNellis added, explaining his view that the crowdfunding industry was regularly taking advantage of Main Street investors.PeerStreet's bankruptcy is also testing a fundamental principle of crowdfunding: It gives small investors a chance to own assets, whether it's a piece of a company or a mortgage loan.Bankruptcy filings show that the El Segundo, California, company is arguing that it controls the loans and should therefore be allowed to sell them at auction to pay off its creditors. PeerStreet's lawyers have pointed to language in the investment agreement that says the notes sold on its platform are unsecured. Instead of a fraction of a mortgage backed by real estate, they're a financial instrument that acts as a fraction of a mortgage secured by nothing.More than 50 investors have sent letters to the judge, the vast majority saying they believe they're secured investors. They have also argued that they should have a right to decide what happens to their investments. The investors who spoke with Insider said they wanted to ride the loans to term in hopes that they could recoup their investments.\u00a0The site's users have cited the company's marketing, such as a post on the company's website that says the notes PeerStreet offers are first-lien loans \"sitting at the safest part of the capital stack.\" The post adds: \"This position is the least risky because these investors will be the first in line to get paid, and take priority to junior debt and equity in the event of default or foreclosure.\" In conversations with Insider, some investors also cited a Burry quote in a press release from 2015 that said: \"PeerStreet's notes are backed by real estate.\"Burry declined to comment for our story, but bankruptcy filings show that he, too, has a lot to lose. In addition to his investment in the company, he was a user of the site with over $600,000 in investments and about $9,000 in cash in his PeerStreet account.The largest investor on PeerStreet's platform, Pacific Funding Trust, which owned just under one-quarter of the notes on the platform, has also filed an objection to PeerStreet's effort to sell the loans, claiming that the notes it purchased were actually pieces of the loans.\u00a0In an August 4 hearing, the bankruptcy judge halted PeerStreet's plan to sell until the question of ownership was resolved, noting both the Pacific Funding objection and the letters from smaller investors. Silverstein, the judge, said the case was extraordinarily complex and that the dispute would take time to figure out.One of PeerStreet's lawyers tried to push the sale forward, arguing that the judge could authorize the sale before figuring out ownership. The judge disagreed.\"If you don't own them, you can't sell them,\" Silverstein said.The PeerStreet investors who spoke with Insider said the outcome of this case could determine whether they stick with real-estate crowdfunding. The next hearing on the question of ownership has been scheduled for Wednesday.\"If they allow PeerStreet to confiscate my investment that they promised wouldn't be confiscated, I don't see why anyone would crowdfund anything ever again,\" Sean Quinn, a PeerStreet investor and retired labor-relations executive, said.Doug Lyon, an engineering professor at Fairfield University and an investor on many crowdfunding platforms, told Insider he planned to continue investing on other platforms but not PeerStreet, even if it successfully emerged from bankruptcy.\"This is where money goes to die,\" Lyon said of the site.Real-estate crowdfunding tends to be restricted to investors with at least $1 million in net worth, not including their home, or $200,000 a year in income. As a result, some investors have hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, according to the bankruptcy court letters.According to Ippolito, unsecured instruments are common in the debt-crowdfunding world, which PeerStreet helped pioneer. One of the largest crowdfunding platforms, Yieldstreet, uses a similar form of note that's not directly tied to the underlying loan, Ippolito found in an analysis of the company's investment agreement.Patch of Land operated with a similar note structure before it paused originations in 2020 and let the loans run to term as it moved away from crowdfunding, according to CEO Jason Fritton. The company was eventually sold, and the platform wound down.To be sure, platforms that offer equity instead of debt tend to provide investors with a true piece of the asset, instead of a note. They do this by creating an entity known as a special-purpose vehicle to buy the property. Then investors receive shares in the actual entity proportional to the amount of money they invested and therefore should have more autonomy in the case of bankruptcy.Of course, equity holders are often the first to get wiped out in a bankruptcy.PeerStreet investors also take issue with the company's past representations about how it would handle a bankruptcy if one ever needed to be filed. In a post on its website, PeerStreet wrote that its investments were held in a \"bankruptcy-remote entity\" and that in the \"unlikely event PeerStreet no longer remains in business,\" a third party would come in to manage the investments \"and ensure that investors continue to receive interest and principal payments.\"Instead, the company froze all payments to investors and lobbied the court to let it sell the loans to satisfy its debts. While some of that money could make its way back to investors, the amount is unclear, bankruptcy experts said.\u00a0The company has argued that it would sell the loans in tranches of similarly performing loans and then pass the proceeds to noteholders after calculating each investor's holding to limit losses.\u00a0But investors said the company could just as easily put the proceeds of any sale into one big pot to pay off its debts in order of seniority. In that case, the platform's noteholders would be below the hedge-fund company Magnetar Capital, which is owed $27 million, lawyers, and even real-estate brokers, bankruptcy experts said.\u00a0Kirk Brett, the chair of Adler & Stachenfeld's bankruptcy group, which is not involved in the PeerStreet bankruptcy, said the question of distributions could play out in various ways, including the big-pot scenario investors said they feared.\u00a0\"I don't think that has been addressed in cases before, and you can tell that because there's not a lot of case-law citations on the issue in the filings,\" Brett said.\u00a0The real-estate-crowdfunding industry is littered with allegations of faulty controls.\u00a0In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the CEO and founder of iFunding and another corporate officer of misappropriating more than $1.17 million in investor funds and making fraudulent statements to investors. In 2021, the two men were ordered to fork over more than $2 million in fines and restitution after admitting to the SEC's allegations.More recently, CrowdStreet has come under scrutiny after it raised $53.8 million for two deals that never closed, prompting an investigation in Delaware bankruptcy court. In July, the fiduciary tapped to review the matter said the money had been \"misappropriated,\" with much of it transferred to entities connected to the CEO of the developer, Nightingale's Elie Schwartz.\u00a0CrowdStreet has responded by blaming Nightingale and said that it was assessing legal actions against Schwartz and Nightingale. Nightingale has not responded to the allegations, but its lawyer told the court the company was working on a settlement with investors after the fiduciary revealed that the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission were looking into the matter.\u00a0Meanwhile, the SEC on Tuesday charged Yieldstreet, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms, with $728.5 million raised, with misleading investors. The SEC said the company did not disclose to investors that the borrowers of a $14.5 million project to take apart a ship had previously failed to repay similar loans to Yieldstreet entities. Investors lost millions.Yieldstreet agreed to pay more than $1.9 million without admitting or denying wrongdoing. In a statement to Insider, the company said it continued \"to aggressively pursue recovery for our investors through ongoing litigation and collection efforts both here and abroad.\"Ippolito told Insider that the industry, which used to have hundreds of operators, had been whittled down to roughly 20 platforms over the past decade.\u00a0Some, such as Yieldstreet, have broadened their operations to other alternative assets, including art and private credit, which has become a highly lucrative pocket of commercial real estate as banks retreat from lending. Some operators have consolidated. Others have wound down their operations. Others, such as Fundrise, have moved away from crowdfunding in favor of a model for private real-estate investment trusts, similar to the BREIT later offered by Blackstone.Fritton, the former Patch of Land CEO, said Fundrise's fund model was the wave of the future for real-estate crowdfunding. There's a large appetite from accredited investors to put money into real-estate deals, but a fund structure can offer more protection for both the sponsor and the investors.A marketplace of individual investments prioritizes the quantity of investments, but a fund requires the sponsor to operate like a more-traditional investment manager, which ideally leads to tighter underwriting standards.\u00a0Funds are also better able to weather the inevitable but random operating expenses that pop up when you're dealing with physical investments, such as a broken elevator or water heater or repairs after flooding. Instead of requiring each individual property to keep enough money on hand to deal with these eventualities, a fund can hold a much-larger amount of cash across all its properties that can be used whenever these issues arise. This means there's much less chance that the sponsor will have to go back to investors to ask for more capital to complete a necessary repair.\u00a0Funds can also protect individual investors from getting wiped out if a single investment goes south, Fritton said. If investors pour all their money into the one deal that fails, they lose it all, but if they pour it into a fund, one deal failing won't make their entire investment evaporate. \"No matter how well you underwrite,\" Fritton said, some deals fail.Fritton gave the example of one deal that looked perfect on paper: The sponsor was the CEO of a publicly traded company with a large amount of experience and fantastic credit. It was the company's first payment default.\"He never paid us a dime on that loan,\" Fritton said.","label":"Real Estate, BI Prime, Startups, Finance, Investing, Real Estate, Mortgage","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/problem-with-real-estate-crowdfunding-2023-9"},"40":{"index":40,"title":"Visa Is Rolling Out GPT-4 to Employees As It Goes All-in on AI","date":1694717332000,"content":"It's been three decades since Visa introduced AI to its tech stack, but by the end of the year, there won't be a job or position that doesn't incorporate the technology.\u00a0\u00a0Visa relies on AI for mission-critical tasks like processing payments, detecting fraud, and securing its massive network infrastructure. It has more than 300 AI models that are live and operating. The payments giant has spent more than $3 billion on AI in the past 10 years and one of its tools used to monitor payments in real time helped prevent $27 billion in fraud in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0It's now licensing generative AI software from OpenAI and will spend hundreds of millions each year on its AI budget and hire thousands over the next two years,\u00a0 Rajat Taneja, president of technology at Visa, told Insider.\"AI is going to be a huge part of how we grow, but it'll also be part and parcel of everybody's work,\" Taneja said. \"That's a big part of how we are going to think about the future, where it's assisting you in almost everything you do, whether it's marketing, finance, client services, or coding.\"The company has licensed a private version of GPT-4 that runs on Microsoft Azure and incorporates Visa's internal data. The payments company has opened the tool to 13,000 employees since February with guidelines on using it and the underlying data. It aims to roll it out to the rest of its workforce by year-end.Taneja himself used it recently to revamp a job posting for an AI role, using ChatGPT to rewrite the job description, draft interview questions based on the position, and then ask the AI for the ideal answers.Visa continues to experiment with similar AI models, like Meta's AI model Llama 2 and those from French-American company Hugging Face, Taneja said.Visa's engineers are leveraging AI to write code, and while it's not perfect, more AI-generated code is being used each week, with about half of the code being approved in some cases. The idea is that engineers will direct and supervise models and use them as an \"assistant coder,\" somebody who never forgets anything, who is trained on the latest technologies, and who continues to know more every single day, Taneja said.Not only will AI change how Visa employees work, but it'll push the firm to grow its headcount too. There are more than 2,500 technologists who build Visa's data and AI platforms and services, but the firm will look to hire 2,000 more people in the next few years to carry out its AI road map.Even though Visa first used AI in 1993, it wasn't until 2014 that Visa rebuilt its core data platform and started applying AI across the business and to maintain operations.Every second, Visa processes up to 76,000 transactions. In the blink of an eye, Visa must connect several parties to authorize transactions while managing risk.\u00a0Speed and security are critical. And AI is necessary for this to happen in real time, the way consumers have come to expect, Taneja said.\u00a0The payments firm uses AI to ensure its systems are up and running, for example, identifying if a cable or fiber has been cut along its 24 million-mile telecommunications network.Visa introduced AI models that ingest billions of data points every day to train on, learn patterns, and identify any cybersecurity or payment-security threats. It uses AI to continuously upgrade its tech stack, with Visa making a thousand software changes and updates on some days.It protects cardholders against criminals signing into their accounts through AI by knowing how a specific customer types in their user ID and password. Biometric behavioral analytics will trigger AI to step up authentication if the models think someone other than the customer is typing in the credentials, even if the ID and password are correct and the IP address and device are recognized, Taneja said.\u00a0AI has been indispensable for Visa to offer clients and customers reassurance and reliability, Taneja said. \"If someone is buying a subway ticket or paying for groceries or buying medicine or having a cup of coffee, then in the event there is a problem going on, Visa's AI systems will continue to work in a way that prevents fraud, catches counterfeits, and catches any ATM withdrawal attacks,\" he added.","label":"Finance, BI Prime, Generative AI, ChatGPT, Visa, Payments, Fintech","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-visa-uses-ai-for-cybersecurity-employees-chatgpt-2023-9"},"41":{"index":41,"title":"The Latest News, Headlines, and Business Stories for September 14","date":1694692294000,"content":"Almost to the weekend! Changing phone chargers is already a massive headache, but now you have the bonus of electrocuting your new iPhone 15 if you use the wrong USB-C plugin.Speaking of shocks, Citigroup announced a massive overhaul on Wednesday that'll reportedly lead to job cuts. It's the latest example of the pressure big banks are under to keep their place atop Wall Street. More in today's big story.What's on deck:\u00a0But first, we're going to switch things up.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\nThe big storyReady or not, changes are coming to Citigroup.The bank announced a massive overhaul Wednesday that'll reduce management layers and almost certainly lead to job cuts. Insider's Jennifer Sor has more on the reorg, deemed by CEO Jane Fraser as the most consequential change to Citigroup in nearly 20 years. Citigroup is pitching the move as a way to simplify its structure. Case in point: Fraser said the changes eliminated 35 committees.Changes like these are bound to ruffle some feathers, but Fraser isn't bothered by it. The reorg will \"make some of our people very uncomfortable,\" but the CEO said she's \"absolutely fine with that.\"That might seem like a harsh stance, but understand the bank needs tough love. Citigroup's share price is down nearly 40% since Fraser took over as CEO in March 2021. To be fair, Fraser's tenure has been an uphill battle. She inherited plenty of headaches from her predecessor, Michael Corbat. That included the bank accidentally wiring $900 million, which is the type of thing that's typically frowned upon in banking.But two-plus years later, problems persist. Before the announcement, the bank's share price was down almost 9% this year, trailing all of its fellow big bank peers in the US except Bank of America.Citi's overhaul represents how big banks are scrambling to stay on top of a financial world passing them by. When news of Citi's reorg broke, I immediately thought of Goldman Sachs. The prestigious investment bank has also grabbed headlines for its multiple reorgs amid a failed push into consumer banking under CEO David Solomon.Meanwhile, my colleague Rebecca Ungarino pointed out that Wells Fargo has faced continued setbacks from a slew of fines over the years as CEO Charlie Scharf continues to work to right the ship.Even the big bank having the best year \u2014 JPMorgan \u2014 isn't completely happy. CEO Jamie Dimon recently quipped he \"wouldn't be a big buyer of a bank\" in reference to proposed regulations requiring big banks to keep more money on the sidelines.But banks' retrenchment could just signal an opportunity for others to fill in the gaps. Whether it's fintechs or so-called shadow banks, there's no shortage of players looking to offer services previously dominated by big banks.That could be a welcome change, but there are risks to moving those services outside the walls of a highly regulated institution.

The chairman of the financial giant Citibank and its parent corporation, Citicorp, he was also a man with a vision. Wriston was a globalist who was deeply influenced by economist Friedrich Hayek's vision of a world in which market freedoms were the basis of individual liberty. Look closely at the burgeoning of international finance, of information networks, of logistical innovations that transformed trade. You'll find Wriston everywhere.\u00a0Wriston's financial innovations helped create the modern Eurodollar market \u2014 a vast offshore realm of financial transactions in US dollars happening outside of US borders. His efforts to build a private global payments system under Citibank's control in the early 1970s prompted other banks to build their own collective system, so as to avoid being drawn inside Citibank's gently smiling jaws.Wriston's willingness to put his ideas into action changed the world. As he explained in 1979, the \"current banking network, with its Euromarkets and its automated payments system\" seemed dull and technical, but it had immense political consequences. He believed that if money could move rapidly from country to country, it could no longer be mastered by nations. Instead it might master them, replacing the whimsical tyranny of political rulers with the austere rigor of market discipline.But the tragedy of globalization was that men and women like Wriston built a world that seemed to escape the control of government but in fact was wide open to government power and its own undoing.At the beginning of Wriston's career, in the 1960s, international banking barely existed. It was sluggish, timid, and lazy. Banks were trapped inside national borders by complex and clashing rules put in place after the financial crash of the Great Depression. These regulations meant that most banks faced little international competition and had scant incentive to invest in new ways of doing things. It was nearly impossible to be a true international bank.The 1960s banking industry was a Victorian relic in the modern era, a clattering steampunk engine of rusting pistons and gutta-percha-covered cables, with a few incongruously modern parts bolted on. Eric Sepkes, who helped build the European payments system, later recalled how Citibank's London operation relied on a system of pneumatic tubes to communicate between the office that initiated the payments to clients \u2014 borrowers, business, brokers \u2014 and the office that authorized those payments. Staff had to handwrite payment instructions on a form, which they then stuffed into a canister and inserted into a partial vacuum conduit that ferried it to its destination where the authorizes would then release the funds (the City of London had built miles of pneumatic tube networks in the nineteenth century). One day, when the payments people didn't hear back from authorization, they discovered that the tube had become blocked. Citibank had to call in a chimney sweep to fix the problem, re-enabling payments processing for the entire continent of Europe.Global banking was a system of mysterious tubes on a much larger scale, with various portals that took money in, did expensive and incomprehensible things to it, and spat it out somewhere else. No one fully understood the machinery, least of all the people who were supposedly in charge. The gentlemanly activities of merchant banking, where men with excellent pedigrees built on their social connections to win deals, remained rigidly distinct from the mundane tasks of payments processing, which were performed by female clerks surrounded by vast piles of paper. It took a very long time to send money across borders. At one point, inflation in Argentina was rising so rapidly that Citibank's branch in the country had to convert its profits into cases of Scotch whisky to prevent the value of the income from being inflated away before they could be sent to New York.Wriston helped rebuild this clanking machine into an engine of transformation, welding disjointed national markets into a true world economy. His strategy was built around two insights. The first was that global markets could \u2014 if they were allowed \u2014 circumvent the labyrinthine systems of rules constructed by national regulators and eventually replace them. The second was that banking was a \"branch of the information business.\"\u00a0Market prices provided one crucial source of information, summarizing as they did the decisions of millions of individuals over what to buy and sell. Technology provided another, allowing banks to discover the information they had buried within their own bureaucracies and to better exchange information with each other and their customers. With proper technology, the dull-seeming backroom activities of banking such as payments processing could become a source of profit and power.When Wriston began to remake Citibank, money had already begun to seep through the seams in the ductwork. Businesses outside the United States desperately wanted US dollars, which were needed, for example, to buy and sell oil, while businesses in the United States wanted to earn higher returns. US regulators had capped interest rates for ordinary consumers and stopped interest payments altogether on corporate deposits, limiting the profits many stateside banks could earn. Bankers had already begun to figure out crafty means to connect overseas dollar demand to American supply.Wriston and his colleagues built the institutional infrastructures that allowed this to happen at scale. They created financial instruments like the certificate of deposit, which provided a legal pipeline to smoothly convey the dollars owned by American businesses to the international banks that needed them for their customers. Citibank's competitors, like JPMorgan and Warburg, adapted these instruments and came up with their own ideas. What was once a small and disconnected trade in Eurodollars, based primarily in London, became a vast marketplace for buying, selling, and lending in dollars outside the United States.As the political economist Eric Helleiner describes it, the Eurodollar market became a legal gray zone where vast amounts of US dollars circulated beyond US borders. As the market grew, the US dollar became established as the universal basis of international trade. If you were a Japanese company selling goods to a business in Italy, it was hard to convert the Italian lira that you were paid in directly into Japanese yen. The economic relationship between Japan and Italy wasn't big enough to support a liquid market where the two currencies could be exchanged directly. The Eurodollar market provided an easy detour, where you could turn lira into dollars and then dollars into yen. And as the supply of Eurodollars grew, it increasingly made sense for companies to simply buy and sell in dollars, which they could then convert into their home currencies.The result was that the dollar became a global currency, without anyone really planning it. More dollars circulated outside the United States than within it. US officials at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere paid surprisingly little official attention to what was happening. This made the market attractive, for example, to the Soviet Union, which needed dollars for international trade but worried that they might be seized by the US government if they were deposited directly in American banks. By using Eurodollars, which were bought and sold in London and Italy, they thought they could avoid this risk.These markets all depended on an infrastructure of clever financial engineering. Banks weren't trading physical stacks of hundred-dollar bills. Looked at closely, Eurodollars were an accounting fiction, imaginary dollars traded between real banks. They couldn't be used for anything other than buying other currencies. But every single Eurodollar had to be backed by a real dollar, sitting in a US bank operating under US law and responsible to US regulators. As Wriston explained, \"All the dollars in the world \u2014 except [physical] currency \u2014 are deposits in a bank in America, because that is the only place anyone can spend a dollar.\"This meant that transactions using Eurodollars had to be cleared through a US bank's internal processes (moving money from one customer's account to another's) or through a clearing institution run by US banks, such as CHIPS, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System. Foreign banks had to maintain clearing accounts in US financial institutions if they were to trade dollars and participate in global finance. The Eurodollar market might indeed have been a pirate kingdom, but it was one where the buccaneers had to regularly provision themselves in the monarch's ports. The more that foreign banks came to depend on access to US dollars, the more vulnerable they were to US regulators, whenever those regulators finally woke up.Gradually, the \"dollar clearing system\" run by US banks like Citibank and JPMorgan and clearing institutions like CHIPS became the beating heart of the world's financial system, circulating dollars around the world in a regular systole and diastole. The Eurodollar market, far from creating a decentered new realm of finance, had made the global financial system more fragile and more vulnerable to American jurisdiction.Wriston had hoped to build a world where business, not government, was in charge. He and his peers helped markets spill over the confines of national borders into each other, a confluence that grew into a world ocean of information, money, and production. But even if business leaders like Wriston did not aspire to become sovereigns, they wanted to build their own business empires.\u00a0In 1998, Helleiner wrote a skeptical riposte to Wriston's vision. It wasn't just that Eurodollar markets existed on the sufferance of governments and would have withered if the United States had not let them flourish. It was that global finance was \"increasingly concentrated\" in great financial centers like New York and London where electronic money had to pass through various \"central 'choke points.'\"As Helleiner speculated, this might actually increase the power of governments like the United States rather than undermining it. The question was when these governments would take up their power, and what they would do when they did.Within a couple of weeks of the September 11 attack, Helleiner's predictions began to become a reality. The US Department of the Treasury started to aggressively investigate its options for gathering financial data from the world, so that it could detect future attacks. One of the key areas to watch, the Treasury found, was the flow of dollars around the world. It began to develop a new kind of sanction, which used its control of \"dollar clearing\" to force international banks to implement US policy outside its borders. The SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) messaging system \u2014 which plays a core role in global financial transfers \u2014 and dollar clearing were combined to cut Iran out of the world's financial system, forcing it to the negotiating table to discuss its nuclear weapons program.\u00a0The US officials who planned these steps often thought of them as once-off emergency measures. But in the years to come, the US government would repeatedly exercise its power over the dollar to exact a financial toll on its geopolitical adversaries \u2014 including, most recently, its sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Instead of the stateless, government-less world that Wriston envisioned, the internationalization of the US dollar became the precedent for a massive transformation of America's financial power.Henry Farrell\u00a0is the SNF Agora Professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS, the 2019 winner of the Friedrich Schiedel Prize for Politics and Technology, Editor-in-Chief of The Monkey Cage at The Washington Post, and co-founder of the popular academic blog, Crooked Timber.Abraham Newman\u00a0is a professor at the School of Foreign Service and Government Department at Georgetown University.Excerpted from UNDERGROUND EMPIRE: How America Weaponized the World Economy by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman.

I don't know who I'm going to be 10 years from now,\" Viera said. \"And I want you to know that no matter what, I'm going to take care of you, even if our relationship ends in divorce.\"Financial expert Suze Orman agrees \u2014 she told CNBC that a prenup might feel unromantic, but it's worth an uncomfortable conversation.\"I get too many emails from older women and men telling me that they've just lost everything because of a divorce,\" Orman said.Orman said despite the initial awkwardness, a prenup can actually make your relationship stronger.Similarly to Viera, she thought the agreement offered couples an opportunity to get to know all their partner's thoughts on money.\"If you cannot talk money to the person that you are about to marry, you are doomed for failure because money is going to run through your relationship more than anything else,\" Orman said.Prenups can protect you from being responsible for your spouse's debt, Orman added, and protect your property both before and after the marriage.Despite these pros, prenups only recently gained some popularity among Americans.The Harris Poll, a global consulting and market research firm, found that in 2022, about 15% of married or engaged Americans have signed a prenup. Historically, numbers have been much lower \u2014 in 2010, only 3% of Americans had signed one, according to another study conducted by Harris Interactive.","label":"Finance, Relationships, Marriage, Finance","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/marriage-financial-experts-prenup-agreement-money-wedding-engagement-2023-9"},"47":{"index":47,"title":"Rich Norwegians Are Relocating to Switzerland to Escape High Wealth Taxes","date":1694490087000,"content":"Some of Norway's most affluent people are moving to Switzerland following the Nordic country's decision to increase wealth taxes last year.The Norwegian government raised the levy from 0.85% to 1.1% in November, prompting about 65 of its wealthiest people to relocate.The group, which is worth more than 47 billion kroner ($4.4 billion), made the move to Switzerland over the course of a year, Norwegian newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv reported.\u00a0Individuals with a net wealth of more than 1.7 million kroner ($158,000) or married couples who have a net wealth of over 3.4 million ($317,000) have to pay the 1.1% tax, according to data from PwC.\u00a0Billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke, who is the main shareholder and chairman of the industrial investment company Aker ASA, told the board in an open letter in September that he made the \"difficult choice\" to move from Norway to Switzerland, per The Telegraph.\u00a0R\u00f8kke, who has a Forbes-estimated net worth of $4.9 billion, had reportedly been the country's biggest taxpayer.\u00a0Switzerland has long been considered an attractive tax haven for affluent people looking to take advantage of its lower taxes.According to PwC, wealth taxes in Switzerland vary by canton \u2013 its 26 regions.It says that the result of this is an \"overall personal net wealth tax rate between 0.02% and 1.03%.\"Switzerland came top of the U.S. News & World Report's best countries for a comfortable retirement ranking.The ranking was made from a global survey and the responses of 6,100 people in their mid-40s or older on things like affordability, taxes, and property rights.","label":"Finance, Switzerland","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/rich-norwegians-worth-billions-relocated-switzerland-escape-higher-wealth-tax-2023-9"},"48":{"index":48,"title":"Saudi Arabia Is Spending Billions on Sports, Tech for a Post-Oil World","date":1694336441000,"content":"Saudi Arabia is in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention that could make or break the most powerful kingdom in the Gulf.After a near-century of relying on its oil riches, the country has been scrambling to set a grand plan in motion that aims to do nothing short of transform its entire economy and pave the way to the future for a nation of youths hungry for opportunity.The plan, known as Vision 2030, is being led by the desperately ambitious 38-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the de facto leader trying to cement both his legacy and the kingdom's place on the global stage \u2014 all by the close of the decade.But radical reform has not been without controversy.The kingdom's been under increasing scrutiny since the Crown Prince rose to power in 2017. Saudi Arabia sparked international outrage in 2018 after Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and continues to face accusations of human rights violations.Despite this, little has been able to stop Saudi Arabia from exerting more and more influence on the global stage.It's opened its purse strings to direct billions of dollars towards everything from sports to media and entertainment as part of an international spending spree aimed at helping it diversify beyond oil.All this makes Saudi Arabia a country more relevant than ever. Here's a closer look at everything from its GDP to employment in the Gulf Kingdom.Like many countries, Saudi Arabia's economy suffered when the pandemic struck in 2020, but the only way has been up since then.It GDP soared past $1 trillion last year for the first time, while per- capita output stood at $30,436, up about 50% in just two years, according to World Bank data.The growth phase, which secured the kingdom's spot as the G20's fastest-growing economy last year, was fueled by higher global energy prices as well as a 4.8% non-oil GDP growth thanks to a boom in areas such as construction and transport, per the IMF.Saudi Arabia may be trying to reduce its reliance on oil revenues as part of its Vision 2030 plan for a diversified economy, but it's clear that crude still calls the shots for the world's top exporter.An 8.7% economic expansion last year was driven by higher oil prices. Saudi Aramco, the majority state-owned oil major that raised $25.6 billion in its 2019 IPO, made record profit of $161 billion last year, up from $110 billion in 2021.Despite the resilience of oil demand even with the rise of renewable energy, Saudi Arabia's wants to increase the share of non-oil exports in non-oil GDP from 18.7% to 50%.Both at home and far away, Saudi Arabia hasn't shied away from investing boatloads of cash. The investments are primarily led by the Public Investment Fund, the state's powerful sovereign wealth fund led by MBS and fund governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan.It's the investment vehicle behind splashy deals in sports such as Saudi Arabia's takeover of Newcastle United and the LIV Golf merger with the PGA Tour, to being the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's domestic investments in giga-projects like NEOM and the Red Sea resort.In August, the fund disclosed assets under management surpassed 2.23 trillion riyals ($594 billion) in 2022, Reuters reported. Almost a quarter of those assets were international.Saudi's population is young and growing. The total hit 32.2 million in May with a median age of 29, according to Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Statistics.The population has increased by a third in 13 years and more than half of Saudis are under 30, according to a 2022 census reported by Reuters.The high proportion of young people attempting to enter the workforce is one of the MBS's biggest challenges. The prince has been attempting to diversify the economy and create opportunities for young workers.Saudi Arabia, along with several other countries in the Arab States region, is a key destination for foreign nationals. Just over 40% of the kingdom's total population are non-Saudis, per Reuters.The country has been heavily reliant on migrant labor for some time, with many employed in sectors such as agriculture and domestic service industries. The country has faced criticism from international groups about its treatment of migrant workers including the exclusions from some protections under national labor law.The unemployment rate was 5.1% in the first quarter of this year, according to estimates based on an official labor force survey. The country's average overall employment participation rate was 61.7% \u2013 52.4% for Saudi nationals and 75.2% for non-Saudis.Saudi women are also less likely to be working, with the unemployment rate for those aged 25 to 54 at 15.7% compared to just 3.5% for men in the same age bracket.The Arab Gulf economies share similar characteristics and are all heavily reliant on oil or gas revenue.While Saudi Arabia was the world's fastest-growing G20 economy last year, fellow Gulf states Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates registered rapid growth as well.The kingdom registered the largest overall GDP in the Arab League last year.Its record-setting $1 trillion economy was more than double the size of the UAE. The kingdom's GDP per capita, however, fell below figures recorded for Qatar, the UAE, and Kuwait, per the IMF.","label":"Economy, Finance, Saudi Arabia, Economy, Employment, Tech","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/saudi-arabia-population-gdp-gulf-kingdom-taking-sports-tech-2023-9"},"49":{"index":49,"title":"This Man Unearthed a Treasure Trove Dubbed the 'Find of the Century'","date":1694271515000,"content":"A Norwegian man who was just trying to get some exercise has unearthed gold jewelry that's about 1,500 years old.Earlier this year, 51-year-old Erlend Bore bought a metal detector after he was advised by his doctor to get off the sofa and find a new hobby. He started walking around his home in Rennesoey near Stavanger in southern Norway, mostly finding scraps of metals and the occasional modern coin.But one day his detector immediately started beeping and just five inches below the soil he unearthed nine gold pendants, three gold rings and 10 gold pearls.\"At first, I thought I had found chocolate coins or plastic pirate treasure. It was surreal,\" Bore told the University of Stavanger.But what he had mistaken for chocolate turned out to be very rare show jewelry from the fifth century. The treasure, weighing about 3.5 ounces, has been hailed as the \"find of the century,\" Ole Madsen, director of the university's archaeology museum, said in a statement.\"In Norway, no similar discovery has been made since the 19th century, and it is also a very unusual discovery in a Scandinavian context,\" added associate professor H\u00e5kon Reiersen.The gold pendants \u2014 flat, thin, single-sided gold medals called bracteates \u2014 date from about 500 AD, the so-called migration period in Norway, which runs between 400 and about 550 when there was widespread migration in Europe.The pendants and gold pearls were part of \"a very showy necklace\" that had been made by skilled jewellers and was worn by society's most powerful, said Reiersen.Bore delivered the jewlry to the museum the day after it was found and will not be able to keep his treasure. Under Norweigan law, objects from before 1537, and coins older than 1650, are considered state property and must be handed in.The gold will be exhibited in Stavanger, about 200 miles southwest of Oslo.","label":"Finance, Gold","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/man-unearthed-treasure-trove-dubbed-find-of-century-jewelry-norway-2023-9"},"50":{"index":0,"title":"GOP Debate Viewership Tumbles 25% From First Event","date":1695859200000,"content":"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nThe second Republican presidential debate of the year raked in 9.8 million viewers Wednesday night, according to Nielsen, a sharp drop off from the first debate that took place in late August, which beat expectations with 12.8 million viewers to become the most-watched political faceoff since 2020.\nSeven presidential candidates attended the second Republican presidential primary debate.

As of Thursday evening, Fetterman is the only Democrat to say he would move to expel Menendez, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) hasn\u2019t called for Menendez to resign. He also has the support of many Republicans\u2014which would make getting two-thirds vote more difficult\u2014who are highlighting the fact that he is innocent until proven guilty, in what may be a move of political maneuvering to hurt Democrats. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted Tuesday that while the charges are \u201cserious and troubling,\u201d Menendez \u201chas a right to test the government\u2019s evidence in court, just like any other citizen. He should be judged by jurors and New Jersey\u2019s voters, not by Democratic politicians who now view him as inconvenient to their hold on power.\u201d\nBig Number\n14. That\u2019s how many of the 15 Senate expulsions since 1789 were related to the Civil War and representatives having support for the Confederate rebellion.\n\nKey Background\nMenendez and his wife were indicted last Friday on charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right and conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. They are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in the form of cash, gold bars and a luxury car in exchange for favors from three New Jersey businessmen. In 2015, Menendez was indicted on bribery charges related to a Florida ophthalmologist who reportedly gave him $1 million in gifts and campaign donations in exchange for political influence, but his trial ended in a hung jury and the charges against him were dismissed. Menendez has continued to deny the new allegations against him and resisted calls to resign, saying that \u201cfor years, forces behind the scenes have repeatedly attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave,\u201d and calling the investigation \u201can active smear campaign.\u201d\n\nFurther ReadingThe HillFetterman says he would vote to expel Menendez from the SenateNytimesMenendez Rejects Democrats' Calls to Resign, Prompting Talk of Expulsion\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Molly BohannonEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/mollybohannon\/2023\/09\/28\/could-menendez-be-expelled-from-senate-heres-what-the-process-would-look-like\/"},"52":{"index":2,"title":"Trump Reverses Course: Won\u2019t Try Moving His Georgia Case To Federal Court","date":1695859200000,"content":"Updated Sep 28, 2023, 07:02pm EDTShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nFormer President Donald Trump will no longer seek to have his Georgia election interference case moved to federal court, opening up the former president to a televised criminal trial, a less favorable jury and the chance to pardon himself if he\u2019s convicted after being reelected.\nTrump was booked in August on multiple charges related to an alleged plan to overturn the results of ...

A total of 41 counts were brought against 19 defendants in the election interference case.

Using that money, the golf startup was able to lure some of the PGA Tour\u2019s best-known golfers, including Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson, kicking off a messy legal fight between the two. Eventually, the PGA Tour forbade its golfers from participating in LIV Golf events, forcing players to pick between the two. Throughout it all, LIV Golf was accused of being a \u201csportswashing\u201d operation by the Saudi government, which critics argued was using the golf league to distract from its human rights abuses. This came to an end in June when the two suddenly announced a merger. That deal has been heavily scrutinized, including by politicians in Washington. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told a group of PGA executives the deal gives the Saudi government \u201cfinancial dominance\u201d because they \u201ccontrol the purse strings\u201d during a hearing in July.\n\nTangent\nThis also appears to be an attempt by Endeavor and Fenway to expand their portfolios in the sports industry. Endeavor, which is based in Beverly Hills, California, just completed its takeover of the popular wrestling label WWE. And Fenway Sports Group, which is run in part by founder John Henry, is based in Boston and commands a massive sports portfolio, owning properties like Liverpool FC, New England Sports Network and Nascar's Roush Fenway Racing, in addition to its marquee team: the Boston Red Sox. A deal with the PGA Tour would add to its burgeoning golf investments. It was a partner in the PGA Tour\u2019s Deutsche Bank Championship, and in August partnered with the Ladies Professional Golf Association. It also invested in TMRW Sports, which is launching a new Tiger Woods-backed golf league called TGL, and owns the TGL Boston team.\nForbes Valuation\nWe estimate Fenway Sports Group Founder John Henry to be worth $5.1 billion, and we estimate KKR & Co. co-founder Henry Kravis to be worth $8.9 billion.\n\nFurther Reading\nHenry Kravis, Endeavor, Fenway Eye PGA Tour Deal to Rival Saudi Arabia\u2019s (Bloomberg)\nPGA Tour And Saudi-Backed LIV Golf Agree To Sudden Merger (Forbes)\nThe PGA Tour Wants U.S. Money As Insurance For Opposition Of Saudi LIV Golf Takeover (Forbes)\nSaudi Public Investment Fund Reports $11 Billion In 2022 Losses\u2014But Sports Investments Might Not Be To Blame (Forbes)\nTiger Woods Joins PGA Tour Board Ahead Of Saudi Merger\u2014Expresses Confidence In Maligned PGA Commissioner Jay Monahan (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0William SkipworthEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/willskipworth\/2023\/09\/28\/pga-attracting-red-sox-and-wwe-owners-as-possible-alternative-to-saudi-investment\/"},"54":{"index":4,"title":"Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance World Tour Shatters Record For Highest-Grossing Month, Report Says","date":1695859200000,"content":"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nSinger Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s world tour raked in $179 million in a single month, according to Billboard, far surpassing a previous monthly record set by her and setting the stage for her to join the likes of Coldplay and Rolling Stone on the list of artists with the highest-grossing tours.\nBeyonc\u00e9's Renaissance World Tour is reportedly the highest-grossing tour by a woman.

An elephant named Tarra was used to entertain people in the 1980\u2019s, including in an act where she rode roller skates, according to the Nonhuman Rights Project. Years later, in 1995, she was moved to The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and became its first resident.\nTangent\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project is working at the state and county level to \u201cdemand recognition of the legal personhood and fundamental right to bodily liberty\u201d of a number of species including great apes, elephants, dolphins and whales that the nonprofit says are held in captivity throughout the U.S. Jane Goodall is among the members of the organization\u2019s board working toward that goal. Earlier this summer, for example, the nonprofit filed a petition in Colorado arguing that five elephants housed at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, Colorado, had the right to liberty and should be released to a sanctuary.\n\nCrucial Quote\nCourtney Fern, Director of Government Relations for the Nonhuman Rights Project, called the legislation \u201chistoric,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s indisputable that elephants suffer when deprived of their freedom and that animal welfare laws can\u2019t end their suffering.\u201d\nChief Critic\nJustin Barker, a political analyst focused on animal and wildlife-related laws, told the California Globe the \u201cOjai law is kind of crazy and is only inviting someone to bring an elephant there and directly challenge it.\u201d Barker compared the Ojai ordinance to lawsuits in the early 90s to protect spotted owls in the Pacific Northwest. A federal court ruling in 1991 closed some parts of the Northwest woods to logging; Barker said loggers who were not happy about the ruling responded in \u201cborderline legal ways\u201d like physically moving the birds. He suggested something similar could happen in Ojai.\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nWhile the ordinance says that law enforcement officers can enforce the legislation, it\u2019s unclear exactly what the penalty against violators would be.\n\nFurther Reading\nOjai, CA Becomes First U.S. City To Recognize Legal Rights Of Elephants (California Globe)\nSend me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Ana FaguyEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/anafaguy\/2023\/09\/28\/california-city-becomes-first-to-legalize-rights-of-elephants\/"},"56":{"index":6,"title":"Nvidia\u2019s French Offices Raided Over Antitrust Concerns, Report Says","date":1695859200000,"content":"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nFrance\u2019s antitrust authority raided Nvidia\u2019s French offices this week over suspicion the tech giant engaged in anticompetitive practices, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the raid who identified Nvidia as the raid\u2019s subject despite the authority not disclosing what entity it targeted.\nNvidia is the leading producer of chip technology.

Glenn Youngkin as a 2024 alternative to former President Donald Trump, according to a Washington Post opinion piece by journalist Robert Costa, as a cast of GOP candidates continue to slump in the polls and as Youngkin emerges in the national spotlight as a rumored 2024 candidate and occasional Trump antagonist.\nVirginia Governor Glenn Youngkin at George Mason University in May.Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nYoungkin hasn't formally thrown his hat in the ring and has shrugged off previous calls for him to run for president, but a group of GOP donors are strategizing behind the scenes to draft him in 2024, with meetings planned in the coming weeks, Costa reported in the Post.\n\n\n\nA Harvard University graduate and former co-CEO of investment firm the Carlyle Group whose net worth Forbes estimated at $470 million in 2021, Youngkin entered Virginia politics in January 2021 when he announced his gubernatorial campaign.\n\n\n\n\nHe spent $5.5 million of his own money and ultimately defeated former Virginia Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe with 50.6% of the vote\u2014a major win for Republicans that placed Youngkin in the national spotlight, one year after Trump lost Virginia by 10 points.\n\n\n\nYoungkin, who cannot run for reelection immediately after his gubernatorial term ends in 2026, campaigned as a self-proclaimed \u201cpolitical outsider with proven business experience,\u201d drawing parallels to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and winning Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\nSince winning the gubernatorial election, Youngkin has signed a slew of conservative bills, including a ban on school mask mandates, pushed for a 15-week abortion ban and issued guidelines on transgender students in schools limiting bathroom and locker room use based on students\u2019 sex at birth, which has been decried by LGBTQ advocates.\n\n\n\nYoungkin\u2019s transgender policy, which also requires teachers to address students by their birth names, has drawn support from conservatives, with a lawsuit filed earlier this month by two mothers in Virginia Beach who argued a local school board failed to follow the policy and violated parents\u2019 rights to \u201cmake basic decisions about the education and well-being of their children.\u201d\n\n\nYoungkin was also courted by former Fox chair Rupert Murdoch on at least two occasions this year, the Washington Post reported, as Murdoch\u2019s relationship with Trump soured in the wake of the 2020 election, with Murdoch asking Youngkin to run for the White House.\n\n\n\n\nNews Peg\nRepublican donors will reportedly meet next month at a Virginia Beach hotel in a closed-door retreat nicknamed the Red Vest Retreat\u2014a nod to his iconic red vest donned during his gubernatorial campaign\u2014to support a Youngkin presidential campaign, CBS News election correspondent Robert Costa in a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday afternoon. Officially, the meeting will focus on a push for full GOP control of the Virginia General Assembly. One billionaire GOP donor, Thomas Peterffy\u2014the world\u2019s 54th richest person with a net worth of $28 billion\u2014told Costa he has already donated \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to Youngkin\u2019s political action committee, saying he believes Younkin \u201cappears to be leaving the door open.\u201d\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nWhether Youngkin will enter the race. Despite the speculation, Youngkin has sidestepped the question, saying this week he was \u201chumbled\u201d by the rumors but wants to focus on Virginia, a point he has reiterated throughout the 2020 election cycle.\nTangent\nA Youngkin presidential campaign would add the Virginia governor to a laundry list of GOP presidential hopefuls, though as of this week, no GOP candidate aside from Trump comes close to taking the lead in early primary polls, even as Trump faces four indictments and as he skips the first two GOP primary debates. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was previously favored by some top donors as a Trump alternative, but he has struggled in the polls and taken stances on Ukraine and business that alienated some former backers, causing heavyweights like billionaire Ken Griffin to back away. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s weighted average, Trump is dominating the field with 54% of likely Republicans supporting him, over 13.8% for DeSantis and 6.3% for Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\nContra\nTrump went on a rant against Youngkin as rumors of a Youngkin presidential run began to circulate last year, taking credit for Youngkin\u2019s rise to national prominence. Trump has taken a similar tack with a handful of other former allies, including DeSantis, a 2024 Trump rival whose rise he has repeatedly taken credit for. In a statement on Truth Social in November, Trump claimed he \u201cgot MAGA to Vote\u201d for Youngkin,\u201d arguing the governor would not have \u201ccome close to winning\u201d otherwise and that he \u201cknows that.\u201d\nSurprising Fact\nYoungkin tip-toed around Trump\u2019s baseless election fraud theories following Trump\u2019s loss to President Joe Biden in 2020. He declined to answer a question on whether he would have voted to certify Trump\u2019s 2020 loss if he had been in Congress on January 6, 2021, before ultimately saying he would have, and doubted Democrats would cheat in the 2021 gubernatorial election, even after Trump speculated about voter fraud with no evidence.\n\nFurther Reading\nAlarmed Republicans are preparing to draft Glenn Youngkin (Washington Post)\nRupert Murdoch Urged Glenn Youngkin To Run For President Against Trump, Report Says (Forbes)\nTrump Lashes Out At Gov.

Engoron issued the Tuesday ruling after James\u2019 office filed a motion\u2014which Trump\u2019s legal team opposed\u2014seeking a summary judgment in the case, arguing a trial was unnecessary in order to find Trump guilty. Engoron wrote that Trump and his co-defendants were living in \u201ca fantasy world, not the real world\u201d when they lied about the size and worth of his properties, including Mar-A-Lago, his 40 Wall Street skyscraper in downtown Manhattan and estate in Westchester County, New York.\nFurther Reading\nDid Judge Kill The Trump Organization?

Specifically, Epic Games argued that Apple\u2019s policies of forbidding third-party app marketplaces, charging a 30% commission on purchases through its own App Store, and these anti-steering provisions were a violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In 2021, after a trial, a federal judge sided with Apple on most of the claims, determining that it did not have a monopoly over mobile gaming and could continue forbidding third-party marketplaces and charging commission. However, the judge decided that Apple\u2019s anti-steering provisions violated California state laws against unfair competition. That change has been put on hold, though, while the appeal process plays out. Epic Games and Apple both appealed the decision, hoping to each reverse the side of the ruling they lost, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision.\n\nTangent\nEpic Games also wants to see this case go before the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the company filed its own petition to the Supreme Court requesting the court hear the case.\nWhat To Watch For\nThe Supreme Court could decide by January whether it is going to take up the case, per its regular schedule.\n\nFurther Reading\nFortnite Maker Asks Supreme Court To Review Apple Monopoly Ruling (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0William SkipworthEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/willskipworth\/2023\/09\/28\/apple-asks-supreme-court-to-overturn-ruling-in-epic-games-legal-battle\/"},"61":{"index":11,"title":"Billionaire And Celebrity Real Estate: Here's Which Homes Hit The Market This Week","date":1695859200000,"content":"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nFrom Nashville to Hollywood, the celebrity real estate market is on a hot streak this week with the likes of Elton John, Cooper Kupp, and James Packer listing their multi-million-dollar mansions with amenities from wine cellars to saunas and theater rooms.\nA Beverly Hills estate owned by billionaire James Packer is listed for $85 million by agents ...

Gaetz has cited a string of demands of which he says McCarthy has fallen short, including passing a balanced budget and holding a vote on term limits for lawmakers. Gaetz amplified his threat earlier this month as budget negotiations heated up, delivering a speech on the House floor in which he accused McCarthy of being \u201cout of compliance\u201d with the agreement: \u201cIt\u2019s put up or shut up time for McCarthy.\u201d Gaetz is among a coalition of far-right House members who said they will vote against a McCarthy-backed continuing resolution that would keep the government up and running temporarily to give lawmakers more time to negotiate a full-year spending plan for fiscal year 2024.\nWhat To Watch For\nCongress must pass, and the president must sign, 12 annual appropriations bills that make up the government spending plan every year before the current fiscal year expires on September 30. With just two days left before a government shutdown, neither chamber has passed a budget or a temporary resolution to keep the government open past Saturday. Right-wing resistance in the GOP-controlled House has effectively halted budget negotiations as they can afford to lose just four Republican votes to pass any legislation without the support of Democrats. In addition to the Republicans who refuse to vote on any short-term legislation, a larger GOP coalition is united behind adding anti-immigration measures and border security funding to the budget\u2014provisions the Democratic-controlled Senate has left out of the short-term spending plan it\u2019s advanced in the upper chamber this week.\n\nFurther Reading\nFar-Right Gaetz Slams McCarthy Over \u2018Baby Step\u2019 Biden Impeachment Probe (Forbes)\nTrump Tells Republicans To Embrace A Government Shutdown To Place Blame On Biden (Forbes)\nHard Right Punishes McCarthy Over Debt Ceiling Deal: How The House Freedom Caucus Is Waging Mutiny (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Sara DornEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/saradorn\/2023\/09\/28\/gaetz-claims-mccarthy-paid-social-media-influencers-to-bash-him-online-but-mccarthy-denies-it\/"},"63":{"index":13,"title":"Uber, DoorDash And Grubhub Must Pay $18 An Hour To NYC Delivery Workers, Judge Rules","date":1695859200000,"content":"Updated Sep 28, 2023, 03:01pm EDTShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nNew York City delivery workers will start making at least $18 an hour after a judge denied an attempt from three food delivery giants to block a New York City minimum wage bill from going into effect\u2014delivering a victory for supporters of the first-of-its-kind law, which is the latest effort to regulate how gig workers are paid.\nNew York City has some 60,000 food delivery workers. Tayfun Coskun\/Anadolu Agency via Getty\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nOn Thursday, New York state Justice Nicholas Moyne dismissed Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub\u2019s attempt to bar the city from implementing the rule\u2014which mandates the companies pay food delivery workers a flat hourly rate of $17.96 or pay 50 cents a minute per delivery.\n\n\n\nMoyne did, however, exempt Relay Delivery, a small delivery service company that joined the suit, from Thursday\u2019s ruling, after the company argued it would be put out of business with the cost increase from the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nThe law was scheduled to go into effect July 12, but legal challenges delayed its start. Earlier this summer, Moyne temporarily halted the law from going into effect and allowed Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub to make additional filings in the case. The food delivery companies argued the added costs of higher wages could pass on additional costs to customers and restaurants and ultimately hurt opportunities for workers. Meanwhile, New York City\u2019s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection argued the law would give delivery workers \u201cfair pay for their labor.\u201d The legislation is one of many efforts nationwide to extend minimum pay rules and other job protections for gig workers, like those at Uber and DoorDash, who are typically independent contractors and exempt from many laws that apply to traditional employees. New York City\u2019s legislation, along with efforts in other states like California and Minnesota, aim to fill that gap. Over the summer in Minneapolis, local officials launched an effort to grant Uber and Lyft more worker protects including giving drivers a minimum wage, but that effort was vetoed by the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey.\n\nBig Number\n60,000. That\u2019s how many food delivery workers New York City has, according to the New York Times. Those workers are paid an average of about $11 an hour with tips and expenses, the Times reported.\nSurprising Fact\nThis is the country\u2019s first minimum pay-rate for delivery workers, according to the Times.\n\nTangent\nAlso on Thursday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law ensuring fast food workers are paid at least $20 an hour. After the $4.50 increase from the state\u2019s current rate, California now has the highest minimum wage of any state in the country.\n\nFurther Reading\nN.Y.

All rights reserved\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nThe law will go into effect next April 1 and applies to restaurant workers at chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide.\n\n\n\nThe law also establishes a fast food council with the power to increase the wage by 3.5% each year through 2029 or the annual change in the consumer price index, whichever is lower.\n\n\n\nThe council will be made up of members representing the fast food industry, the workers\u2019 side and one unaffiliated member of the public who will serve as chair.\n\n\n\n\nThe new minimum wage marks the end of a years-long battle between workers and the restaurant industry, which was preparing to spend more than $100 million fighting the bill, according to NBC.\n\n\n\n\nBig Number\nAbout 500,000. That\u2019s the approximate number of employees the law will apply to, according to PBS.\nTangent\nAnother worker-specific law will go into effect in New York City after a judge on Thursday blocked Uber, DoorDash and GrubHub\u2019s attempt to stop the city from implementing a $18 minimum wage for delivery workers.\n\nSurprising Fact\nWest Hollywood, California, has one of the highest minimum wages in the country at $19.08. The rate will be in effect until next June, when it will increase by the consumer price index adjustment.\nKey Background\nCalifornia\u2019s fast food workers made an average of $16.60 per hour and an average wage of $34,530 as of last May, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although the rate is among the highest in the country, workers have taken issue with the gap between it and California\u2019s living wage, which is $21.24 for one single adult or $43.44 for an adult with one child, according to MIT\u2019s living wage calculator. California legislators passed a separate bill for healthcare workers this month that would bring the minimum wage to $25. If passed, the law won\u2019t apply to doctors and nurses but will include those who do everything else at hospitals, dialysis clinics and other healthcare facilities, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFurther Reading\nCalifornia Gov.

That\u2019s about how many wheelchairs United carried on flights in 2022, the company said. During the past four years, United and United Express carriers mishandled wheelchairs at a rate of 1.2%, making them third-best among domestic carriers tracked, according to the DOT agreement.\n\nKey Background\nFigueroa was an advocate for disability rights and was on her way home from lobbying Congress about disability rights in Washington, D.C. on a United flight, when her custom chair\u2014valued at around $30,000\u2014was ruined. The lawsuit filed on her behalf alleges she was forced to sit in a non-motorized courtesy wheelchair for hours, which supposedly reopened a wound and caused \u201cmuscle cramps and spasms.\u201d In a filing from May, United disputed the liability and damages claims and that \u201cany act or omission of United was the proximate cause of Decedent\u2019s injuries or death.\u201d The suit alleges United refused to pay for a replacement chair until Figueroa contacted her local senators and got them involved in filing a complaint, after which they agreed to get a chair but got it to her too late as her condition had worsened. She died on October 31, 2021, a little over three months after her United flight.\nTangent\nThe Biden Administration has taken a particular interest in improving infrastructure accessibility. In the last year, it awarded $686 million in funding to projects in nine states that will increase the number of rail stations meeting or exceeding ADA standards and invested in developing accessible electric vehicle charging stations, according to the White House.\n\nFurther ReadingReutersUnited Airlines agrees to improve flight access for wheelchair usersWSJUnited Airlines Agrees to Smooth Travel for Wheelchair Users\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Molly BohannonEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/mollybohannon\/2023\/09\/28\/united-airlines-enhancing-wheelchair-accessibility-after-federal-complaint-heres-what-will-change\/"},"66":{"index":16,"title":"Hyundai And Kia Recall Over 3.3 Million Cars\u2014Here\u2019s What Drivers Should Know","date":1695859200000,"content":"Updated Sep 28, 2023, 03:13pm EDTShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nHyundai and Kia recalled over 3.3 million of their 2010s model vehicles for fluid leaking issues that could spark engine compartment fires while parked or driving\u2014encouraging owners to park outdoors and away from buildings in case of fire.\nHyundai and Kia, both of Hyundai Motor Group, have recalled over 3.3 million vehicles and are urging ...

In August, both Hyundai and Kia recalled some 92,000 vehicles, including the Hyundai Elantra (2023), Hyundai Kona (2023), Hyundai Palisade (2023-24), Hyundai Sonata (2023), Hyundai Tucson (2023), Kia Seltos (2023-23), Kia Soul (2023) and Kia Sportage (2023), due to oil pumps that could overheat and catch fire. In March, they made a similar plea for owners to park outdoors and away from other cars, homes and buildings when they both recalled over 570,000 vehicles released between 2019 and as late as this year for fear they could catch fire, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Kia, specifically, had to recall 188,912 of its 2021-23 Kia K5 models due to side curtain airbags potentially deploying improperly and causing injury during a crash.\n\nSurprising Fact\nAlong with a spate of car recalls, both Kia and Hyundai are being sued by the city of Chicago for allegedly not having specific security technology within their cars that the city says led to a car theft crisis. About 17 cities are suing the automakers for similar reasons, though they have pushed for a U.S. judge to reject them, claiming other factors like city policing policies and TikTok videos that teach people how to break in certain Kia and Hyundai models are to blame for the uptick in car theft, according to Reuters. \nTangent\nRecalled Hyundai models this week include the Accent (2012-15), Azera (2012-15), Elantra (2011-15), Elantra Coupe (2013-15), Equus (2014-15), Genesis Coupe (2011-15), Santa Fe (2013-15), Santa Fe Sport (2013), Sonata HEV (2011-15), Tucson (2010-13), Tucson Fuel Cell (2015), Veloster (2012-15) and Veracruz (2010-12).

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.)\u2014the Oversight Committee\u2019s top Democrat\u2014said Republicans are doing Trump\u2019s bidding in launching the impeachment inquiry, accusing them of acting \u201clike flying monkeys on a mission for the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d He added that the mountain of bank records Republicans have collected from Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden and other family members doesn\u2019t show a \u201csingle dime\u201d went to the president.\n\nKey Background\nMcCarthy, facing pressure from the hard-right wing of his conference, announced earlier this month that the House would formally open an impeachment probe into Biden, led by the Oversight, Judiciary and Ways and Means Committees. Republicans have claimed without solid evidence that Biden abused his powers to financially benefit himself and his family members, citing bank records that detail his son Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings.\nTangent\nAmong the most explosive allegations Republicans have launched against Biden is an FBI whistle-blower\u2019s claim that the president and his son accepted a bribe from an executive at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma in exchange for then vice president Biden to advocate for the ouster of then Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who Republicans have claimed was investigating Burisma. The claim is fraught with factual fallacies, however. The FBI has not verified the whistle-blower allegation, and a former Shokin official said Burisma was not under investigation at the time. What\u2019s more is the U.S. was part of an international coalition pushing for Shokin\u2019s dismissal over concerns he was not pursuing corruption cases.\n\nFurther Reading\nBiden Impeachment Inquiry: Here\u2019s How The Process Could Play Out\u2014And How It Could End (Forbes)\nBiden Impeachment Inquiry: All The Allegations Against The President Leveled By House GOP, Explained (Forbes)\nHouse GOP Launching Impeachment Inquiry Into Joe Biden, McCarthy Says (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Sara DornEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/saradorn\/2023\/09\/28\/biden-impeachment-inquiry-gop-witness-turley-admits-theres-not-enough-evidence-to-impeach-biden-yet\/"},"69":{"index":19,"title":"Want The Job Covering Taylor Swift Or Beyonc\u00e9?

[+] reporter positions to cover both pop stars. (Photo by Mat Hayward\/TAS23\/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)Getty Images for TAS Rights Management\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nGannett\u2014the nation\u2019s largest newspaper chain\u2014posted both positions at USA TODAY and Nashville-based daily paper the Tennessean about two weeks ago, and fans of Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 have jumped on the opportunity to show the news org they have what it takes to report on both Grammy Award-winning superstars.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported Thursday that applicants included influencers, Emmy award-winning journalists and a White House reporter.\n\n\n\nThe remote positions seek candidates with five years of newsroom experience, in addition to having sufficient knowledge of pop culture and the effect both women have on society and the music industry.\n\n\n\n\nGannett chief communications officer Lark-Marie Ant\u00f3n told Forbes the network is committed \u201cto providing our audience with the content they crave.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nExactly how much the job will pay. Gannett posted a massive wage range, saying the job pays somewhere between $21.63 and $50.87 an hour. \u201cExact compensation may vary based on skills, experience, location, and union representation, if applicable,\u201d the company noted.\nKey Background\nIt\u2019s been a major year for Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter and Taylor Swift. Beyonc\u00e9 was the most nominated artist at the 2023 Grammys. With 28 total wins in her career, she has become the woman with the most Grammy awards of all time. The \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d singer also made history with her Renaissance world tour, which brought in $127.6 million over 11 shows in July\u2014the largest one-month sum for any singer since the mid-\u201880s, according to Billboard. In addition to the success of her Eras tour, an upcoming film of the concert and an upcoming re-release of 1989, Swift has also had a busy year. The \u201cShake It Off\u201d artist brought in $2.2 billion in North American ticket sales alone and is also reportedly earning over $8.5 million per month in streaming royalties for her three album re-releases, which she recorded again due to royalty and ownership disputes.\nForbes Valuation\nBoth women are on Forbes\u2019 Self-Made Women of 2023 List, with Swift\u2019s estimated net worth valued at $740 million and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s at $540 million.\n\nTangent\nOn TikTok, users have shared the job postings for both singer-songwriters, adding that this could be a prime opportunity to attend concerts that were otherwise difficult to find tickets for due to demand drastically exceeding supply\u2014leading to steep price points. Fans struggled to nab Taylor Swift Eras tour resale tickets for an average of $1,619 on SeatGeek, while Beyonc\u00e9 tickets ranged from $102 on the lower end to around $1,401 and up for BeyHive VIP packages, depending on the seat and venue. Prospective candidates spend hours on their applications to USA TODAY, with 24-year-old journalist Lexi Thompson telling the Journal she spent six hours creating her Legally Blonde-style application video. The two job postings also come at a peculiar time for Gannett, which experienced a mass exodus among senior and executive roles, in addition to multiple recent layoff rounds. Gannett\u2019s workforce has shrunk 47% in the last three years, according to the NewsGuild, with hundreds of journalists walking off the job to demand higher wages and changes in leadership.\nCrucial Quote\n\"Reviewing these roles has not broken my soul, quite the contrary!\u201d Nick Capaz, Gannett talent acquisition manager, told Forbes. \u201cThe end game is that we will have two incredible reporters creating joyful content for our audience.\"\nSurprising Fact\nMore than half of U.S. adults say they are fans of Taylor Swift, according to a Morning Consult survey published in March.\n\nFurther Reading\nListening to Taylor Swift in Prison (The New Yorker)\nThe Legacy Of Beyonc\u00e9  (Essence)\nMore Than Half Of U.S. Adults Say They\u2019re Taylor Swift Fans, Survey Finds (Forbes)\nTaylor Swift, \u2018Barbie\u2019 and Beyonc\u00e9 are unleashing the spending power of women (CNN)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Check out\u00a0my\u00a0website.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Amanda FlorianEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions","label":"Business","link":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/amandaflorian\/2023\/09\/28\/want-the-job-covering-taylor-swift-or-beyonce-about-1000-others-have-applied\/"},"70":{"index":20,"title":"US Football League And XFL Announce Intention To Merge\u2014Create New Spring Football League","date":1695859200000,"content":"Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nThe United States Football League and XFL announced Thursday that they intend to merge pending regulatory approval, as the rival spring football leagues backed by Fox Corporation and an ownership group that includes Dwayne Johnson, respectively, aim to create a new professional league as an alternative to the NFL.\nBoth leagues said a potential merger would establish \u201csubstantial capabilities and resources to ...

The XFL was launched in 2001 as a joint venture between NBC and World Wrestling Entertainment, before the league was closed after its first season. Vince McMahon spent $200 million to launch the league again in 2020, though the effort was cut short after five weeks because of the pandemic. An ownership group that included Johnson, Dany Garcia and RedBird Capital Partners subsequently purchased the league for $23.5 million, including $8.5 million to settle previous XFL debt. The USFL launched in the early 1980s before folding in 1985, and was revived by Fox in 2022. The USFL\u2019s viewership is slightly higher than the XFL\u2019s, with games averaging 751,000 viewers on Fox, FS1, NBC and USA Network.

It is now three acts, an evolution of reassessed expectations and redefined goals. Longer life expectancies, and the health care costs that come with them, should be top of mind.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.Running out of money in retirement tops the list of concerns for clients. Nearly 73% of RBC Wealth Management clients surveyed said they worry about outliving their assets, while 62% said they were concerned about the cost of health care and long-term care.Being too cautious and spending too little during your working years might needlessly restrict your lifestyle. But spending too much and not taking longevity into account increases your risks in retirement. Planning for the post-work years is a balancing act, but you can set yourself up for success by considering how you will spend your time and money during those three phases.Leaving a life focused around a career represents a major transition. While taking a break from the workaday world may be a relief, you may find yourself wanting to continue an active lifestyle.Along with travel and renewed interest in a hobby, more Baby Boomers realize the importance of being involved during retirement, which could mean traveling, volunteering with charitable organizations or even taking on childcare duties with grandkids.This means their spending is equal to or, in some instances, higher than what it was when they were working. Some decide to continue working on a reduced scale to keep busy or stretch their dollars in retirement. Before making that choice, consider the following.Heading into your 70s, you will likely still be \u201con the go,\u201d but it\u2019s reasonable to expect the pace of life beginning to slow down.At this phase, retirees are staying closer to home, starting to downsize their lifestyles and spending less \u2014 less on cars, less on homes, less on travel. They are leading a simpler and thus more inexpensive lifestyle.Besides health care, housing is one of the most expensive pieces of the retirement puzzle. Not only is it a large expense, for many it represents a significant and often overlooked asset. To think about retirement without having a serious conversation about housing is a mistake.Consider the following housing choices when developing your plan:As you reach your 80s and 90s, another major shift in focus often occurs: spending less money on activities like travel and hobbies and more on the essentials of life.The challenge in these years isn\u2019t normal monthly expenses \u2014 it\u2019s planning for health care, including the possibility of moving to a retirement village or nursing home. Preparing in advance for this stage of life is critical.Annual out-of-pocket health care expenses, on average, are nearly triple for an 85-year-old couple compared to a 65-year-old couple, according to a 2021 HealthView Services report.While most don\u2019t like to think about it, long-term care and its costs are no longer something we can ignore. Seventy percent of 65-year-olds will need some form of long-term care, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The national annual median cost for a private room in a nursing home is $108,405, with the average length of stay at 2\u00bd years.Consider the following health and long-term care pieces as you set up your plan:For couples, having a survivor benefit plan is also important. Often the survivor will have greater care needs as they age without the support of the spouse.How confident are you that you're truly prepared for what retirement may throw your way?The answer may lie in having a comprehensive wealth plan in place. Eighty-four percent of RBC Wealth Management clients surveyed who have a wealth plan are confident about retirement, while the same is true for only 45% of those without a plan.It makes sense. Those who worked with a financial adviser and created a wealth plan have fewer concerns and generally are less likely to be blindsided by a change in direction that can easily occur over the course of a long retirement.A solid retirement plan, created thoughtfully and managed over time, can help you prepare for unexpected changes in your life and give you the freedom to identify solutions to suit your lifestyle as your circumstances change in your three acts of retirement.This article was written by and presents the views of our contributing adviser, not the Kiplinger editorial staff.

The remarkable rally of 2023 lost steam a couple of months ago amid mounting anxieties over everything from interest rates and bond yields to rising oil prices and the outlook for global growth. The S&P 500 is still up more than 11% on a price basis so far this year, but sentiment has shifted since the benchmark index hit its 2023 peak at the end of July.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.Indeed, the S&P 500 is down about 7% since then, with fears of a government shutdown weighing on the index as we approach Washington's weekend deadline.\u00a0Throwing a potential government shutdown into the mix when markets were already struggling during the seasonally weakest month of the year for equities is less than ideal. Whether stocks can get back on track for a fourth-quarter push very much remains to be seen. A government shutdown certainly can't help matters, the thinking goes.Happily, for market participants, the historical record for stocks when the federal government shuts down is far from one of doom and gloom.\u00a0There have been 21 government shutdowns since 1976, but on only four occasions were operations affected for more than one business day, writes Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. That leaves us with only four \"true\" shutdowns, Buchbinder notes, the last occurring in late 2018 into early 2019.\u00a0It's tough to remember now, but the S&P 500 returned 10.3% during the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019. Stocks did fine during the extended shutdown of October 2013 too.\"Historically, markets were not materially impacted by a shutdown,\" Buchbinder says. \"For example, in 2013, the House and Senate were in a standoff over funding for the so-called Affordable Care Act and the government was shut down for 16 days during the first part of October. The S&P 500 had some down days but overall, the equity market took all the political drama in stride with a 3.1% advance during those 16 days.\"It's sort of counterintuitive, but during the 21 government shutdowns, the S&P 500 rose 55% of the time, generating an average return of 0.3%, according to data from Carson Group. Even better, 12 months after the end of the shutdown, the S&P 500 was higher 86% of the time, with an average return of 12.7%.\u00a0Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but the record for stocks in government shutdowns is almost encouraging. When the last federal government shutdown ended in 2019, the S&P 500 went on to return almost 24% over the next 12 months. There are probably plenty of market participants who would take that deal again.\u00a0","label":"https:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/investing\/what-does-a-government-shutdown-mean-for-stocks","link":null},"73":{"index":2,"title":"Deferring Taxes Until Retirement? You May Want to Reconsider | Kiplinger","date":1695894020000,"content":"Conventional wisdom about putting money in qualified accounts (401(k), 403(b) and IRA are examples) for decades has been to defer your tax liability on those assets for as long as possible and get growth in those accounts unhindered by taxes. If you can wait and pay Uncle Sam later, why pay him now?As the qualified accounts grow, so does the tax liability \u2014 along with the future pressure that required minimum distributions (RMDs) may cause related to where you end up in tax brackets and Medicare premium surcharges.The reality is that if tax rates go up, deferring is not likely helpful and may actually be harmful. If you have a known tax liability today (that\u2019s fairly low by historical standards), settling that liability is not always a bad idea.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.The risk of deferring taxes well into the future is the uncertainty. Tax rates down the road are up in the air, but you can probably count on the word \u201cup.\u201d They are relatively low now, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which expires at the end of 2025. Taxes can go up in the future in at least a few ways. (They can go down or stay the same also, but few believe that will happen.)First, for many people, tax rates can increase starting in 2026 if Congress doesn\u2019t extend the rules currently in place, and who knows how high they might go in subsequent years as many continue to retire? When Uncle Sam comes calling in your retirement (RMDs and Medicare premiums included), you\u2019ll likely want more control and less tax burden whenever possible.Second, many retirees may face tax increases for other reasons. Death of a spouse is one. Divorce can be another. Either circumstance can put a person into a single-tax-filing status whereas they previously filed jointly.Further, taxes could also go up if Congress chooses to raise rates to address the spending that seems to continue to spiral.Here are some other issues to consider.Too many people, because they want to limit as much as possible the amount of tax they will pay in a given year, will not sell a stock that has appreciated significantly and will allow greater and greater concentration in an individual stock. That is an example of letting \u201cthe tax tail wag the dog.\u201dWhen it comes to investment returns, your focus should be on managing risk and thinking in terms of net gains after taxes and on limiting your taxes in retirement. Again, this is about considering settling a liability at a reasonable tax rate rather than at a rate that is likely to be higher in the future. Just like ordinary income tax rates can increase in the future, so, too, can capital gains tax rates.Pay attention to tax location when looking at your investments. What does that mean? You do not have to have your qualified accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s) invested the same way as your non-qualified accounts (those that don\u2019t receive \u201cpreferential\u201d tax treatment).Example: Let\u2019s say I am retired and have $1 million in a traditional IRA and decide to withdraw $50,000 from that IRA. That withdrawal will be taxed as ordinary income, as is the case with all qualified accounts, no matter what I own in that account.But with a non-qualified account, how the money is taxed depends on what kind of investment asset I own. For instance, if I own a corporate bond, and I receive interest income on that bond, that is going to be taxed as ordinary income. But if I own a stock, and its value has increased significantly, all of that appreciation is capital gain and, if held for greater than 365 days, is treated as a long-term capital gain and not ordinary income. And under current law, capital gains taxation is generally better for the taxpayer than ordinary income taxation.So, consider owning things that generate ordinary income in accounts that, no matter what you own, are taxed as ordinary income, and own more capital-gain-oriented assets in accounts that can enjoy capital gains rates.It is beneficial to have assets that have the highest long-term growth potential in a Roth IRA. You don\u2019t get to defer taxes on the money you deposit in a Roth, but you do get growth tax-free and withdrawals tax-free. You\u2019re not going to be hit with taxes when you make withdrawals in retirement, which means you don\u2019t have to worry about those future tax rates.If you have a capital-gain-oriented asset (usually assets that have growth potential), such as a stock, the least advantageous thing you could do in terms of taxes is to invest in that stock through a qualified account. Again, that goes against conventional wisdom because everyone is told to defer, defer, defer, and you get to use the government\u2019s money \u2014 until it is time to pay the piper later.When you defer, all you are doing is expanding the liability. When you put $100,000 in a 401(k), you\u2019ve deferred taxes on that $100,000, but if it grows to $500,000 over many years, wonderful, you\u2019ve also got a tax liability on that $500,000 awaiting you. And if the tax rates are higher when you get to retirement, what you gained will be considerably less.Having a short-term mentality is not prudent when it comes to investing, nor is it when it comes to taxes. It is not the person who pays the least amount of taxes this year who wins. It is the person who thinks long-term and limits their long-term tax liability \u2014 and has a more enjoyable retirement because they did so.Dan Dunkin contributed to this article.The appearances in Kiplinger were obtained through a public relations program.

You\u2019re likely even getting unsolicited calls and emails. All kinds of health insurance brokers and companies want to dazzle you with their offerings.Yep, Medicare open enrollment starts soon. It\u2019s time to make sure you have the best plan or plans for you.\u00a0First, let\u2019s review the basics. As most retirees know, Medicare has several parts. Part A, which is offered at no cost, generally covers hospitalizations. Part B covers outpatient medical care. Part D is prescription drug coverage provided by private insurers.\u00a0Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.Medicare Advantage is the umbrella term for plans offered by private insurers regulated by Medicare to replace parts B and D. Medigap plans, also offered by private companies, are supplemental plans that cover copays and coinsurance charges imposed under Medicare Part B.While some people assume that Medicare will cover all their healthcare costs, experts warn that\u2019s not the case. A 65-year-old retiring this year can expect to spend an average of $157,500 in healthcare and medical expenses throughout retirement, according to data from Fidelity Investments. This highlights the importance of reviewing your Medicare plan choices during open enrollment each year to ensure you have the best coverage to meet your needs.Every year, Medicare\u2019s open enrollment period is October 15 to December 7. This is the time to enroll in or make changes to any Medicare or Medicare Advantage policies, although you may be restricted from making a change regarding a supplementary policy, or Medigap.There is another open enrollment period only for people with Medicare Advantage plans, from January 1 to March 31. During this January open enrollment, you can change from one Medicare Advantage plan to another or go back to original Medicare.\u00a0But while authorities urge an annual review of your coverage, you don\u2019t have to do anything if you\u2019re happy with what you have. If you want to maintain your current Medicare coverage, you do not need to re-enroll.While Part D plans can change the drugs they cover, and Medicare Advantage plans can change their provider networks as well as your costs and other provisions, less than one-third of enrollees are estimated to take advantage of open enrollment to compare plans and reevaluate their coverage.\u00a0Tim Smolen, director of the Washington State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIP), which helps residents navigate Medicare, says beneficiaries consistently care about three things during open enrollment: access, what benefits are included in their plan, and cost.\u00a0That last issue is the toughest to gauge. \u201cIt's very difficult to forecast in the year ahead how much health care you're going to use,\u201d he says.People who choose to keep traditional Medicare may also enroll in a supplemental medigap plan from a private insurer to cover costs like copays. Traditional Medicare, when not paired with Medigap, does not have a limit on out-of-pocket expenses in a year.\u00a0Medigap policies, which cannot be paired with Medicare Advantage plans, have standardized benefits. Most states offer 10 types of Medigap policies, but premiums vary by insurer. You can compare costs, benefits and availability on Medicare\u2019s website.\u00a0If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, you may switch to traditional Medicare, but you may have trouble getting a Medigap policy. Some states offer more protections than others, but, in general, your first time enrolling in Medicare is your best opportunity to get a Medigap policy.These plans have a monthly cost, in addition to the Part B premium, that varies depending on the plan. The plans frequently include prescription drug coverage and limits on annual out-of-pocket costs for covered services.\u00a0They also may offer extras not included by traditional Medicare, such as dental, hearing and vision coverage and gym memberships. They are able to do this because they manage costs, partly by limiting beneficiaries to in-network providers. During open enrollment, experts recommend checking to make sure your preferred providers remain in the network for your plan.\u00a0These plans have come under fire in recent years for their aggressive marketing tactics. Some beneficiaries have told of having good experiences with their Advantage plans until they get sick and find themselves fighting for coverage.\u00a0Sandy Leith, director of SHIP for Illinois, says advertisements for some plans set people up for failure, with important details hidden in fine print. Appeals for denied claims can be difficult to navigate. \u201cThey're getting away with a lot of misrepresentation and services that aren't up to par,\u201d Leith says.At press time, the government had not yet announced premium amounts for traditional Medicare for 2024.\u00a0The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) did say the average total monthly premium for Part D coverage is projected to be about $55.50, a decrease from $56.49 for 2023. That drop will likely be offset by an increase in premiums for Part B, which were expected to rise at least $15 a month.\u00a0According to CMS, the average monthly plan premium for all Medicare Advantage plans is projected to increase by 64 cents from $17.86 in 2023 to $18.50. If enrollees choose to stay in their plan, most will see little or no premium increase for next year, with nearly 73% of beneficiaries not seeing any premium increase.\u00a0People with higher income are charged higher Part B and D premiums \u2014 the income-related monthly adjustment amount, or IRMAA. In 2023, a single person with an income between $97,000 and $123,000 was charged $230.80 a month for Part B, compared to premiums of $164.90 for people who earned less. Your income for IRMAA purposes is calculated based on income two years before the plan year.\u00a0You can appeal your IRMAA if your income is significantly lower now than two years ago due to a life-changing event, such as retirement, divorce or death of a spouse, or if you think the government made a mistake. Beyond that, the only way to avoid the surcharge is to have less modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which includes all taxable income from work and investments, as well as the taxable portion of your Social Security.\u00a0Unfortunately, most popular deductions, such as charitable donations and mortgage interest, do not reduce your MAGI. However, withdrawals from Roth IRAs don\u2019t count toward your MAGI. If you\u2019re still working, you can contribute more toward tax-deferred retirement accounts to lower your income. Another option is to delay starting Social Security.\u00a0In general, you initially enroll in Medicare within three months before and three months after turning 65. Failing to do so can result in financial penalties, increasing your premiums for the rest of your life.\u00a0However, there are exceptions, including many people who receive health insurance through their employer or through their spouse\u2019s job, as long as the workplace has 20 or more employees. Be sure to check with your employer about how it handles your group health coverage at age 65.\u00a0Be warned of the \u201cCOBRA trap\u201d \u2014 insurance you may receive after you leave your job does not eliminate the requirement that you apply for Medicare at age 65.\u00a0The choices can seem overwhelming, and the marketing can be confusing and misleading. Fortunately, each state has unbiased experts who can walk you through the different plans and help you make sure your plans are the best for your needs. State Health Insurance Assistance Programs can be found through www.shiphelp.org or by calling 877-839-2675.

VA would continue to process and deliver benefits to veterans, including compensation, pension, education and housing benefits, and the board would continue to process appeals,\u201d McDonough said.\u00a0Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.However, he added, outreach services to veterans would be stopped, public-facing regional offices would be closed, and many regular operations such as career counseling, transition assistance and cemetery grounds maintenance would not be available.Under the VA\u2019s FY 2021 shutdown contingency plan \u2014 the last public update available \u2014 the agency said that 96% of its employees would either be fully funded to work or required to perform certain functions during a shutdown and that significant services including certain benefit functions under the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) would continue.According to the plan, significant activities that would cease during a shutdown include VBA Education Call Center, as well as all public and intergovernmental affairs functions such as national programs, special events and Tribal Government relations.When asked about whether the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) \u00a0would continue to hire and onboard new employees since some of the agency\u2019s human resources personnel would be furloughed, McDonough said this is one of the areas the VA is looking at closely.The VHA, part of the VA and the country\u2019s largest integrated healthcare system, has been aggressively hiring to reach a goal of increasing its workforce by 52,000, or 3%, in preparation for a wave of veterans under the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, the new law that expands healthcare and benefits for those exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange and other toxic substances.Unlike the VA, the Department of Defense (DOD) is one of many federal agencies and departments waiting on Congress to approve 12 appropriations bills covering fiscal 2024 by the September 30 deadline, an outcome few in Washington expect.Without that funding, the DOD would furlough about 800,000 civilian employees but require some 2 million U.S. military members to continue to perform their duties without pay, although they would receive back pay once the government reopens, according to the DOD\u2019s Sept. 12 shutdown contingency plan. The agency would not award new contracts during a shutdown, but contracts already in place would continue.\u201cThe department will continue to defend the nation and conduct ongoing military operations,\u201d according to the DOD\u2019s plan. \u201cIt will continue activities funded with any available budgetary resources that have not lapsed, as well as excepted activities such as those necessary for the safety of human life and the protection of property.\u201dTens of thousands of other \u201cnon-essential\u201d federal workers from various agencies are also expected to be furloughed should there be a shutdown as some agencies partially close and some services reduced. Social Security would be impacted by a government shutdown, with 8,512 of its 61,869 workforce furloughed, but it would continue to send Social Security checks.Likewise, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid would be affected by a government shutdown but continue to provide essential services, albeit with a reduced staff. That means that in the event of a funding lapse, Medicare and Medicaid programs and services, including the sending of Medicare payments would continue.A government shutdown could also impact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which initially was expected to continue functioning as usual during a shutdown, but now reportedly may be partially shut with thousands of employees furloughed.The Department of Education (DOE) contingency plan, last updated in 2021, states that basic operations, including the servicing and disbursement of federal student loans and Pell Grants, could continue for a very limited time during a shutdown but that these operations could also experience some level of disruption.At a September 25 White House press conference, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked whether the Oct. 1 deadline for student loan repayments could be pushed back, given the looming shutdown. For now, people are expected to start paying student loans even in the event of a shutdown on October 1.Jean-Pierre responded that if the shutdown occurs, \u201cwe anticipate that key activities at Federal Student Aid will continue for a couple of weeks.\u201d However, if the shutdown lasts a few weeks, it \u201ccould substantially disrupt the return to repayment effort.\u201d","label":"https:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/politics\/how-government-shutdown-impacts-veterans","link":null},"76":{"index":5,"title":"What to Know When You Need a Business Loan | Kiplinger","date":1695903321000,"content":"There are times when your business needs a cash injection. You may require a major piece of equipment, say, or have to cover expenses as you increase your employee count. Whatever the reason, borrowing money is something that might be necessary from time to time.But what exactly should you apply for? There\u2019s not just one type of loan appropriate for all businesses or purposes. Here\u2019s a quick guide to help demystify business loans and provide guidance on choosing the best one for your needs.\u00a0There are numerous types of loans available, and there are instances when one variety is more appropriate than others. I won\u2019t get into all of them, but here are some of the most common varieties to know about.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.First, there is the traditional business loan, also known as a term loan. With such loans, you contact a lender \u2014 either a bank or a private lender \u2014 and apply for a set amount of funds. These are then scheduled to be repaid over a certain time period. Getting a traditional business loan approved is by no means guaranteed. Banks will want to see a solid business plan or history in addition to a good credit rating.\u00a0Traditional loans are usually best when businesses need a predetermined amount of money for a specific purpose. That may include things such as a large equipment purchase or a set period of time you\u2019ll have to cover payroll.\u00a0Term loans oftentimes require collateral of some sort before the funds are released. This can be business equipment, real estate, accounts receivable, inventory or securities.There are instances where no collateral is required. Usually, these unsecured loans come with higher interest rates, carry extra fees or require a personal lien.\u00a0A Small Business Administration loan is similar to a standard business loan but has a couple of key differences. With an SBA loan, you still take out a loan through a banking institution. Unlike a standard loan, however, the government will back a portion of your loan. In addition, you will provide a personal guarantee against the loan. Because you and the government are relieving the majority of the risk, the bank is more likely to approve your loan and possibly offer lower interest rates.Other benefits of SBA loans include longer repayment periods, higher loan amounts and low fees. All of that probably sounds pretty good, so why don\u2019t all businesses take advantage of SBA loans? The answer is that they can be difficult to qualify for.Not only is good credit required, but businesses typically need to have been established for at least two years. A great deal of documentation is necessary, as well. Then, if you\u2019re successfully approved for a loan, it can take a while \u2014 sometimes months \u2014 to receive the funds. So if your cash requirements have a quickly approaching deadline, a traditional loan or line of credit might be a better option.\u00a0Kiplinger Advisor Collective is the premier criteria-based professional organization for personal finance advisors, managers, and executives. Learn more >As I just mentioned, lines of credit can work well for quick cash needs. With a line of credit, companies have a set amount available that they can draw from. Some lines of credit are even directly linked to a business\u2019 bank account as a kind of built-in overdraft protection.\u00a0Some businesses find lines of credit to be an efficient system, but they\u2019re definitely for smaller, ongoing cash necessities. Lines of credit almost always have higher interest rates than standard business loans. So if you consistently max out your line of credit and never look at your monthly statements, you might be unaware of how much you are paying in interest.\u00a0Whether it\u2019s a small business loan, a line of credit or an SBA loan, you\u2019ll likely be dealing with a bank. While banks must adhere to certain rules and regulations, not all of them are equal. Since your financial institution can have a major impact on your overall business wellness, choose carefully.The first thing to avoid is being tricked into a tempting introductory offer. Maybe a bank is offering an ultra-low interest rate on new loans. Check to see how long this interest rate is good for. If the rate is subject to change after six months, it might not be such a good deal.Something else to consider is the depth of the relationship you can develop with the people at your bank. With national banks, you might benefit from robust online banking capabilities and other perks but be a virtual stranger to their employees.\u00a0With local or regional banks and credit unions, there tends to be more potential for customization and negotiation. One of my peers was able to structure a line of credit at his local bank that automatically fed into multiple entities. The bank created this option at his request and did some custom coding to accomplish it. Without that close relationship, this arrangement would likely not have been available. So before choosing a bank, check around with your business peers to see which institutions have top-notch people who value customer service.Given all the options that exist, business loans can seem complex. But just knowing the basic types and which ones might be available to you can be beneficial.\u00a0So before applying for a loan, figure out exactly what you need and why. If you don\u2019t, your business could suffer devastating cash shortages during the crucial startup stages. In fact, according to CB Insights, 38% of startups fail because they ran out of money or failed to raise funding. To avoid failure, do your research and give yourself the best chance of getting the right loan for your purposes.The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

This is the fifth round of shipments of the free antigen tests, which provide quick results but are less accurate than lab tests.The tests come with set expiration dates and don't last forever, and officials decided it would be best to ship them out now ahead of colder fall and winter months when respiratory viruses are known to spread.\nAds by Money.

Still, you never know when you could be exposed, so you might as well claim your free tests and hopefully avoid having to pay for over-the-counter kits at the pharmacy, which will likely run you more than $20 for a two-pack.To order four new free COVID-19 tests from the government, you\u2019ll simply need to complete an online form, entering your name and the address where you want the U.S. Postal Service to deliver the tests. You can also include your email if you'd like to get shipping updates.The website is easy to use, but you can also call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s hotline at 800-232-0233 for assistance.You can order up to four tests per household using the government website COVIDTests.gov. The site will ask you to enter your name and address for the delivery. The tests are expected to ship starting in October, and the Postal Service will send them out via its First Class Package Service for deliveries in the continental U.S.If you need immediate testing, there is also a government website for finding free community-based testing options at pharmacies and other locations.No, you do not need health insurance to order free COVID-19 tests online. Part of the purpose of the test delivery program is to make testing available to uninsured Americans who have fewer free options.Ordering tests for delivery through the U.S. Postal Service is a convenient option that's totally free, whether you have insurance or not.Health insurance companies used to be required to cover at-home COVID-19 tests. Up until May, you could get up to eight tests per month through private health insurance with no out-of-pocket costs. However, that ended when the federal public health emergency expired, and many major health insurance companies immediately stopped covering over-the-counter tests.It's unclear how long the free home tests that the government is shipping will last, but officials said they \"are intended for use through the end of 2023.\" The tests will come with instructions for checking the exact expiration date.Rapid tests have a shelf life, so it's a good idea to check the expiration date on the box whenever you take one.If the expiration date has passed, there's still a chance the test is good. That's because many tests' expiration dates were extended after production, so you should consult the FDA's website to see if your test is still valid.In addition to sending out COVID-19 tests, the federal government is encouraging Americans to get a new vaccine booster as the other prong of its efforts to address the possibility of a significant outbreak of COVID-19 returning in the fall or winter.On September 12, the CDC approved updated versions of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for people who want a shot designed to protect against more recent strains of the virus. Almost everyone is eligible to get a shot, aside from infants under 6 months old.Pharmacies and other providers are already administering the vaccine. Even if you don't have health insurance, all Americans have options to get the new vaccine for free.\nNewsletterDaily MoneyEvery day we publish the latest news, stories, and content on the financial topics that matter.

A colossal shortfall in retirement savings is shaping up to be a financial burden that will ultimately affect all taxpayers.Retirees, taxpayers and both the federal and state governments will suffer at the hands of the looming retirement crisis that research from Pew Charitable Trusts released earlier this year says will cost over $1.3 trillion by 2040.However, the non-governmental organization suggests that there's an underutilized solution that could relieve much of the burden: state-run individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, which could help workers save for retirement and enable the government to avoid covering the hefty shortfalls.These programs would allow private employers without the means to create their own retirement savings programs to offer employees an automated IRA. As it stands, only 11 states have adopted these programs.\nAds by Money.

It adds that state governments will be cumulatively burdened by $334 billion over the same time span.These sizable costs are what governments would need to pay to properly address a boom in public assistance demand if things continue as they are. Pew says that this demand would also lead to an increased burden on taxpayers due to decreasing revenues and a drop in quality of life for retirees.What's more, the Pew Trusts estimate that the ratio of retirement-age households to working-age households will grow by 46% between now and 2040. This means that the burden of this $1.3 trillion shortfall will be borne by a smaller population of working-age taxpayers.According to Pew, \"the study estimated the cumulative additional taxpayer liability because of insufficient retirement savings to be $13,600 per household.\"\nAds by Money.

Click below to learn more.Start Investing\nThis data may seem bleak, but as the Pew Trusts point out, there is a solution being undertaken by some states: automated savings programs, or automated IRAs.Some private employers, especially small businesses, are not able to offer employer-based retirement savings options like 401(k)s due to high administrative and financial costs. Auto-IRAs take automatic payroll deductions from employees and roll them into a retirement savings plan that bears no cost on the employer. Employees are typically automatically enrolled in these programs, though they can easily opt out.The research estimates that the average worker need only put aside an extra $140 per month over a 30-year period to help offset the retirement savings gap and largely erase this $1.3 trillion crisis. As it stands now, 11 states (and the city of Seattle, Washington) have implemented auto-IRAs. Four of these states have already seen average monthly savings grow to or above $140 per month.If households could save this much in retirement accounts, \"they could erase the retirement savings gap, eliminate the extra taxpayer burden, and help people maintain their lifestyles in retirement,\" the Pew report states.Pennsylvania is not among the states who have an auto-IRA program, though a bi-partisan group of lawmakers is trying to bring one to the Commonwealth.The proposed Keystone Saves Program Act would make Pennsylvania the twelfth state to offer an auto-IRA. According to the Keystone Saves Coalition, an interest group trying to bring auto-IRAs to the state, and that also includes the Pew Charitable Trusts as a member, says the proposed auto-IRA program would help the state to reduce an estimated $17.8 billion windfall it will be tasked with paying over the next 17 years.\nNewsletterRetire with MoneyRetire With Money brings the latest retirement news, insights, and advice to your inbox.

This is the fifth round of shipments of the free antigen tests, which provide quick results but are less accurate than lab tests.The tests come with set expiration dates and don't last forever, and officials decided it would be best to ship them out now ahead of colder fall and winter months when respiratory viruses are known to spread.\nAds by Money.

Still, you never know when you could be exposed, so you might as well claim your free tests and hopefully avoid having to pay for over-the-counter kits at the pharmacy, which will likely run you more than $20 for a two-pack.To order four new free COVID-19 tests from the government, you\u2019ll simply need to complete an online form, entering your name and the address where you want the U.S. Postal Service to deliver the tests. You can also include your email if you'd like to get shipping updates.The website is easy to use, but you can also call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s hotline at 800-232-0233 for assistance.You can order up to four tests per household using the government website COVIDTests.gov. The site will ask you to enter your name and address for the delivery. The tests are expected to ship starting in October, and the Postal Service will send them out via its First Class Package Service for deliveries in the continental U.S.If you need immediate testing, there is also a government website for finding free community-based testing options at pharmacies and other locations.No, you do not need health insurance to order free COVID-19 tests online. Part of the purpose of the test delivery program is to make testing available to uninsured Americans who have fewer free options.Ordering tests for delivery through the U.S. Postal Service is a convenient option that's totally free, whether you have insurance or not.Health insurance companies used to be required to cover at-home COVID-19 tests. Up until May, you could get up to eight tests per month through private health insurance with no out-of-pocket costs. However, that ended when the federal public health emergency expired, and many major health insurance companies immediately stopped covering over-the-counter tests.It's unclear how long the free home tests that the government is shipping will last, but officials said they \"are intended for use through the end of 2023.\" The tests will come with instructions for checking the exact expiration date.Rapid tests have a shelf life, so it's a good idea to check the expiration date on the box whenever you take one.If the expiration date has passed, there's still a chance the test is good. That's because many tests' expiration dates were extended after production, so you should consult the FDA's website to see if your test is still valid.In addition to sending out COVID-19 tests, the federal government is encouraging Americans to get a new vaccine booster as the other prong of its efforts to address the possibility of a significant outbreak of COVID-19 returning in the fall or winter.On September 12, the CDC approved updated versions of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for people who want a shot designed to protect against more recent strains of the virus. Almost everyone is eligible to get a shot, aside from infants under 6 months old.Pharmacies and other providers are already administering the vaccine. Even if you don't have health insurance, all Americans have options to get the new vaccine for free.\nNewsletterDaily MoneyEvery day we publish the latest news, stories, and content on the financial topics that matter.

Fixed-rate annuities, which are typically funded years in advance in a lump sum or multiple payments, are another popular option.Fixed annuities offer guaranteed income when a worker retires, either in a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual payment, for the rest of the contract holder\u2019s life. In other words, annuities are essentially like a regular paycheck in retirement that you can collect alongside monthly Social Security payments and other income.Combining a 401(k) with an annuity allows retirees to reap the benefits of an investment that produces capital gains and one that produces a steady, fixed income stream \u2014 aka \u201cblended\u201d income.\nAds by Money.

The majority of blended-income retirees are enjoying retirement more than those who only have investments or annuity income. What\u2019s more, the guarantee of lifetime income provided by annuities can help protect retirees from outliving their savings.But there are drawbacks to annuities, like expensive upfront sales fees and annual fees between 1% and 3% of the annuity price, according to insurance company Nationwide.Annuities also aren\u2019t liquid, so if a contract holder tries to withdraw money within the first few years, they\u2019re subject to a \u201csurrender\" fee that reduces the value of their investment. You also have to pay taxes and fees on annuity income because it\u2019s regarded the same way as the earnings you receive while you\u2019re working.The Goldman Sachs report shows that many Americans are struggling with a \u201cfinancial vortex,\u201d or competing costs like swelling debt, higher education and student loans that make it difficult to save for retirement at all.

(Money\u2019s Best Colleges list can help you find schools that are worth the money.) Ultimately, how good of an investment you make depends in part on how much you pay \u2014 and to pick the right college at the right amount, you first have to understand how college pricing works.Here are four myths about college costs and what experts say you need to know to make your higher education experience worth it:On the websites of the country\u2019s most expensive colleges, you\u2019ll see exorbitant estimates for the full cost of attendance: the University of Southern California, for example, now lists the total price as $90,921 \u2014 for a single year.Figures like that can discourage folks into thinking a college education isn\u2019t worth it or is out of reach. But the reality is that only a fraction of students \u2014 less than a third in the case of USC \u2014 pay full price.The majority of students, at USC and across the country, receive grants and scholarships that reduce what they have to pay. This is called the net price of attendance in higher education lingo.Nationally, students actually paid an average price of $28,660 at private nonprofit four-year colleges, counting tuition, fees, room and board, and other costs for the most recent school year, according to College Board research. The figure is almost half that, $14,560, at public four-year colleges. (USC, for what its worth, still lands on the expensive side; the average net price is about $36,800.)Jackie Copeland, associate provost and director of scholarships and student aid at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says the difference between sticker price and real price is \u201cone of the biggest things that we attempt to get through to families when we have the opportunity to speak with them directly.\u201dShe recommends families use net price calculators before applying to receive financial aid estimates based on their income, tax and household information.Lydia McNeiley, college and career coordinator for a school district in Hammond, Indiana, says greater awareness that advertised prices aren\u2019t what you\u2019ll typically have to pay could help college seem more feasible to many of her students, who would be the first in their families to go. Nearly 80% of the district\u2019s students are economically disadvantaged, so cost is a primary concern.Many of her students, in fact, don't realize there are state programs like the 21st Century Scholars that could cover their tuition at a public school like Purdue University.You might be surprised just how much a family can earn while still qualifying for need-based aid at some schools, particularly selective colleges that tend to have greater financial resources.A handful of elite schools are basically free for families with incomes below $75,000 (or higher thresholds in some cases) and that includes tuition, room and board, and more. At several institutions, full-tuition scholarships are available to most families earning up to $150,000.It doesn't stop there, either: At Stanford University, which has one of the most generous need-based aid programs, even families earning between $225,000 to $250,000 get a break: The average scholarship and grant amount for this income bracket is $33,800 per year, which reduces their average net cost to $50,060. For families with multiple kids in college, need-based aid is available at income levels above $300,000.The challenge with these wealthy, elite institutions, of course, is getting in. If you don't, there are many private colleges that focus a significant portion of their financial aid on non-need-based aid, more commonly called merit aid.At the University of Dayton, for example, 43% of students without any financial need receive merit grants, and the average amount is nearly $25,000.When you're researching colleges, you can look for schools that meet financial need with no-loan commitments, as well as colleges that meet 100% of students' financial need, which generally means their financial aid packages exclude private loans, unsubsidized federal loans, or parent PLUS loans. Or, if you're looking for colleges where you can get in and qualify for a significant merit grant, try looking for schools that give out significant merit awards and where you're at the top of the academic profile of admitted students. (Many colleges will share a class profile on their websites or you can search for a college's \"Common Data Set\" to look up statistics of incoming students.)\nAds by Money.

Click below for more information.View Rates\nWhile in-state public schools are generally among the lowest cost options for students, you don\u2019t have to limit your search there if you\u2019re looking for a low price.Robert Lovvorn, a college counselor at Riverdale High School in Portland, Oregon, says students who are focused on finding an affordable college are increasingly looking beyond their state schools. Tuition costs have risen so much at the University of Oregon and Oregon State University that other colleges are looking more affordable, he says.It can sometimes cost about the same for a student to attend a public school in another state in the Northwest, like Montana State, thanks to tuition reciprocity agreements between nearby states. Add on any scholarships, and out-of-state schools can become cheaper than in-state options, Lovvorn says.At UNC, Copeland agrees that costs aren\u2019t always higher for out-of-state students. Non-resident students whose families are within 200% of the federal poverty guidelines can be eligible for the university\u2019s Carolina Covenant program, which qualifies them for debt-free financial aid packages.Private universities can also be cheaper for students who\u2019ll receive aid, especially in a states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Vermont, where public universities are comparatively expensive. Looking at the University of Pittsburgh and Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, you'll find the estimated price for students who receive aid is slightly lower, at $22,400, at the small private college, compared to the estimated in-state price for students who receive aid at the large public, $24,700. Dickinson\u2019s full tuition is higher, but over 90% of students receive grants or scholarships.At public universities in areas with higher costs of living that also have relatively low tuition prices for in-state students, the cost of room and board can trump the price of tuition.Schools like the University of Florida and California State University, Los Angeles are examples of universities that publish room and board costs that are actually quite a bit higher than their in-state tuition prices.Room and board costs have been soaring lately with inflation. In April, Michigan State University officials announced a nearly 7% increase for the upcoming year as they reported that their food costs were up 25%, according to MLive.It's a similar story pretty much nationwide, according Jim Hundrieser, vice president for consulting and business development at the National Association of College and University Business Officers.Even though some schools have made only modest tuition increases this year, \u201calmost all of them are having to look towards a room and board increase to pay for those increases in utilities, construction or renovations, upkeep, food, staffing,\u201d Hundrieser says.\nAds by Money.

But don't just CTRL+F your desired college's website for a dollar figure \u2014 that'll likely give you the sticker price. What you actually need to know is the net price, which is how much you'll pay after grants and scholarships are figured in.That number will help you map out how much you need to borrow for all four years of college.You can use a net price calculator to get an estimate. Search for the college you\u2019re interested in on the Education Department's website here to find specific prices. You can also look up average net prices by income using the College Navigator tool.Though these tools can give you a general idea of how much you can expect to pay for college, everyone's situation is different. For net price calculators and similar pricing tools, the accuracy of the estimate will depend on how detailed and accurate the information you provide about your income and assets is. People who are eligible for federal aid can get a better sense of costs when they fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).To submit the FAFSA, you\u2019ll need documents like your family's tax records, bank statements and investment records. The FAFSA also requires a Federal Student Aid account (called an FSA ID). Go to fafsa.gov to get started.The application typically opens in the fall ahead of the year you\u2019ll be using the money, and it can be submitted until the end of the academic year. However, many states and schools award aid on a first-come, first-served basis. They also may have their own priority deadlines. That's why you're encouraged to do the FAFSA as soon as you can every fall.Once you've turned in your FAFSA, you'll receive what's called a student aid report. The student aid report will display a measure of your family\u2019s finances and indicate whether you qualify for need-based financial aid, like a federal Pell Grant.After you've been accepted to a college, you'll typically get a financial aid award letter that explains the combination of grants, scholarships and government loans you've been deemed eligible for. (Read more about how to get free money for college here.) It'll also give you instructions on how to accept, or confirm, your financial aid.There are two major types of student loans: federal and private. Federal student loans are made by the government and overseen by the U.S. Department of Education, whereas private student loans are made by banks or other financial institutions.Experts generally recommend consumers stick with the federal loan program rather than going the private route because the government provides more opportunities for relief if borrowers end up struggling with repayment. Federal student loans may also have lower interest rates than private student loans, and they're available regardless of your financial standing or credit history.Direct subsidized loans are for undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. One notable quirk is that the federal government pays the interest on these loans while you're enrolled in college and during a six-month grace period after you graduate.(Note: Since March 2020, federal student loan payments have been paused and interest hasn\u2019t accrued for millions of borrowers, however, that is scheduled to end later this summer after the Supreme Court weighs in on the Biden administration\u2019s loan forgiveness plan.)Other types of federal student loans include direct unsubsidized loans and direct PLUS loans.Unsubsidized loans are an option for undergraduates as well as graduate students and professional students. These loans don't require financial need, but you're on the hook for the interest as soon as you take out a loan. Direct PLUS loans include loans for graduate students, as well as parent PLUS loans, which can be used to pay costs for a child enrolled in an undergraduate program.Federal loans carry fixed interest rates, which means the rate will remain the same throughout the repayment term. For undergraduate borrowers in the 2023-2024 school year, the interest rates for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans is 5.50%. For graduate\/professional borrowers, it\u2019s 7.05%.For direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans \u2014 also sometimes called Stafford loans \u2014 there are borrowing limits based on your year in school and your status as an independent or dependent student under FAFSA. You can see a detailed breakdown by grade here, but speaking broadly, limits for undergraduates range from $5,500 to $12,500 in federal loans a year.It's worth noting that there is a one-time loan fee of 1.057% for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans.Direct PLUS loans involve a basic credit check, but denials are uncommon. PLUS loans carry higher interest rates \u2014 currently 8.05% \u2014 and a higher origination fee of 4.2%. The biggest PLUS loan you can get is the total cost of attendance minus your other financial aid.It\u2019s smart to explore your repayment options and likely monthly payment amounts before you borrow to make sure you\u2019ll be able to handle the loans once you leave school. There are several repayment options for federal loans; the government even has a loan simulator tool that helps you find your best repayment strategy based on your employment situation, location, salary, projected income growth, tax filing status and more. You can choose whether you'd prefer to pay your loan off fast, prioritize a smaller monthly payment and so on.For some students, federal loans will not be enough to cover the costs of their education. After you've exhausted your federal loan options, you may still have gaps to fill.Issued by companies like Sallie Mae, SoFi and Earnest, as well as credit unions, private loans have fewer protections than federal loans. They're contingent on your credit score, and they don't necessarily have borrowing limits \u2014 which can be dangerous for a student who borrows more than they can ultimately afford.As such, tread carefully. Many experts recommend students avoid private loans altogether, but if you are going to take them out, make sure to shop around and scrutinize each lender's terms, fees and perks before committing. Note that while students can take out federal student loans regardless of their parent\u2019s income or credit history, with private student loans, most undergraduate students are going to need a creditworthy cosigner to get approved for a private loan.Student loans aren't mandatory. Families sometimes tap a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay for college. Interest rates may be more favorable, but because your house is your collateral, this strategy can be risky. You're basically transferring the burden from one loan to another.Another way to manage college costs is to check with the financial aid office to see whether your school offers a tuition payment plan. These can allow families to make payments over a period of time as opposed to all at once up front.\nAds by Money.

But there is other paperwork to complete with the U.S. Education Department. With federal student loans, you'll have to do some entrance counseling that runs you through the basics of borrowing money. It'll take about a half hour.You'll also need to sign a master promissory note in which you formally commit to paying back your loan plus any interest.If you're pursuing a private student loan, you'll probably need to pass a credit check. According to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, your lender is likely looking for you to have a score \"in the high 600s\" or above. The better your credit score, the better your loan terms and interest rates will be. If you have bad credit or no credit history (like most younger undergraduate students), you will need a cosigner. Like with other loans, a student loan cosigner agrees to share responsibility for the debt if the borrower doesn't pay it back.To prepare for a credit check or loan application and get an idea of where you stand, you may want to pull your credit report and review your credit history for any major errors. (You can get one free credit report every week on AnnualCreditReport.com until December 2023.)When it actually comes time to apply for a private student loan, you should have your (and your cosigner\u2019s) financial information on hand, including employment and income history, bank statements and tax documents.Don\u2019t procrastinate coming up with a plan to pay back your loan.It\u2019s critical to understand how much your first payment will be and when you\u2019ll owe it. Experts say for every $10,000 you borrow, you can expect to owe $125 a month for 10 years.With federal loans, one popular repayment route is income-based repayment, which ties your monthly student loan bills to your earnings. You could have no required monthly payment, or you could be asked to pay up to 20% of your discretionary income.After 20 or 25 years, depending on the income-based plan you qualify for, any outstanding student loan debt will be forgiven. But keep in mind that while these plans can reduce how much you pay monthly, they may actually increase how much you pay over the long term because your monthly amount due may not be enough to pay down your principal.If you're having trouble affording your student loan payments, the government allows borrowers to defer (or postpone) their payments or put loans into forbearance. In forbearance, interest always accrues; in deferment, interest will accrue on most loans, though there are some that are exempt.For this reason, the Education Department urges borrowers to learn their other repayment options before resorting to deferment and forbearance. In most cases, enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan to lower your monthly payment to a more affordable amount is preferable to either forbearance or deferment. (If you're already in one of these plans but are still struggling to afford your debt, you may be able to update your financial information to reduce your payment.)Private lenders often have forbearance options, too, but they are less generous than federal ones. Should you choose to refinance your loans, companies like Splash Financial or Credible can help you compare interest rates and (hopefully) save money. There\u2019s little downside to refinancing private student loans to get better repayment terms, but you should think very carefully before refinancing federal loans; refinancing means you give up access to all federal benefits and repayment options.Ultimately, you want to do everything you can to avoid missing payments. Not only does it start you down a path to delinquency, which can affect your credit score, but it can also push your loan into default. There's a long list of consequences for defaulting on your student loans \u2014 it can impact your eligibility for more aid, stop you from accessing deferments and prevent you from getting your transcript. The government can withhold money from your tax refunds. You might even end up in court.Before it gets to that point, you should reach out to your servicer, a financial advisor or a student loan counselor.\nAds by Money.

Parent PLUS loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Graduate students can use PLUS loans as well. \r\n                      \r\n                      The other type of loans are private student loans issued by banks and credit unions. Usually, experts say to exhaust federal student loan options before taking out private student loans.\r\n                      Can I get a student loan on my own? chevron-downchevron-upIt depends. For federal student loans, most students who are under 24 years old are considered dependent students, and the government requires you to submit information about your parents' income for financial aid calculations. That said, unsubsidized federal loans aren't based on parents' finances, so even though you have to submit their information, it will not affect your\u00a0 eligibility for that type of loan. You may be able to get a loan (and other federal aid) without involving a parent if you meet the criteria detailed here.\r\n                      \r\n                      With private student loans, lenders will often ask for cosigners if a student lacks a strong enough credit history. How much can I borrow with student loans?chevron-downchevron-upFor undergraduate federal student loans, the maximum for dependent students is $31,000. For independent students, the max is $57,500. In both cases, students can only borrow up to $23,000 in subsidized loans. More information about borrowing limits for federal student loans is available here. Borrowing limits for private student loans vary by lender. What do I need to qualify for a student loan? chevron-downchevron-upTo take out federal student loans, you must first be enrolled or accepted into a college or another qualifying program. You'll need to have a Social Security Number and either be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Other criteria include meeting academic progress standards and signing a section of the FAFSA that confirms you're not already in default on a federal student loan, among other things. You can read more about qualifying for federal student loans here. Subsidized student loans have additional qualifications because you need to demonstrate financial need.\u00a0\r\n                      \r\n                      For private loans, you (or a cosigner) will need to meet the individual lender's income and credit requirements.\r\n                      \nHow to Pay for CollegeBest Student Loans Guide to College Grants and Scholarships","label":"Loans","link":"https:\/\/money.com\/get-a-student-loan\/"},"85":{"index":7,"title":"Guide to College Grants and Scholarships | Money","date":1687737600000,"content":"College-bound students might think application season is done once they hit submit.

Grants and scholarships come from different agencies and institutions, including the federal government, state governments, colleges and private organizations.The big difference between the two is that grants tend to be need-based, while scholarships tend to be merit-based or interest-based. Merit-based awards are often tied to academic achievement; that means good grades, test scores or both. But scholarships can be awarded for other attributes, such as an underrepresented background, leadership, music, sports, community service, a specific major or geographic diversity. Sometimes scholarships include a need-based component and may require students to submit their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to show qualifying income. The main thing is to read the fine print on eligibility and start applying early.Scholarships come from a variety of places. Two of the largest sources are state scholarships \u2014 funded by state governments \u2014 and institutional scholarships from colleges.Many states offer scholarships as incentives for resident undergraduate students to stay in-state for college. The goal is to encourage eligible students to stick around after graduation to contribute to the state workforce, possibly in a high-need field like healthcare. A few examples are Florida\u2019s lottery-funded renewable Bright Futures Scholarship, Georgia\u2019s Hope and Zell Miller Scholarships, New York\u2019s Excelsior Scholarship, and Washington\u2019s Opportunity Scholarship for specific fields.Many state scholarships require demonstrated academic achievement in high school, such as a certain GPA, standardized test scores and specific coursework. Even if a scholarship is need-based, like the Excelsior program in New York, it may include stiff academic progress requirements while in college. Many state scholarships only work at public institutions (community colleges or universities), but some, like the Washington Opportunity Scholarship, can also be applied to private colleges.In your scholarship search, check out your state financial aid program and the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s higher education agency map. Most state scholarships require residency, but not all do.If you apply to the right college for your profile, you could be awarded a renewable scholarship for good grades, a sport or a special interest. Common scholarship types include:Not all colleges offer equally generous scholarships. For example, the highly elite colleges don\u2019t offer academic scholarships at all, only need-based financial aid. That\u2019s because everyone at these schools is a top student. So, if you\u2019re a valedictorian from a high-income family hoping for a merit scholarship, you won\u2019t receive one at Ivy League schools, for example. You\u2019d be better off looking for a college that is known to award large merit scholarships.This is why it's critical to take the time to understand the different types of financial aid individual colleges offer. (Many colleges explain their financial aid policies on their websites, but if you\u2019re confused about how a specific college hands out its financial aid budget, you can ask the financial aid office. Colorado College, for example, has a clear policy about meeting need rather than offering merit scholarships.)Community-based organizations, nonprofit foundations and other groups award scholarships for the same kinds of attributes that colleges do. These scholarship opportunities start as small as a couple hundred dollars and increase in value all the way up to awards that cover most of the cost of attendance. In general, the more money on the table, the more competitive the scholarship program. More on how to find these below.The three main types of grants come from the federal government, state governments and colleges. They\u2019re given to students with financial need.The most well-known grant is the federal Pell Grant, but the federal government also offers a few others for specific demographics.Many states offer one or several need-based grants for resident undergrads. Like state-funded scholarships, the goal is to encourage students to work in-state after graduation. Check state financial aid programs where you live or in the state where you're interested in attending college to learn the latest (not all require residency). A few examples of state grants include:Typically, grants from colleges are renewable if your income doesn\u2019t change much. That can add up to a significant amount of money. Remember those elite colleges? They can open affordable doors with need-based grants to qualifying students. Even middle-income families can qualify at these colleges. Stanford, for example, recently expanded its financial aid program so that most students from families earning up to $100,000 get tuition and room and board covered. And several schools, including Princeton and Rice universities give full tuition scholarships to families earning up to $140,000 or $150,000.Organizations and foundations offer grants for study abroad, particular fields of study, underrepresented students, and non-traditional students such as a mother returning to college. Note that many of these aren\u2019t designed for bachelor\u2019s degree programs, and instead are specific to graduate-level studies.\nAds by Money.

Click below for more information.View Rates\n\nFor federal grants, simply fill out the FAFSA. Federal financial aid is a good beginning, but for most people, it\u2019s not a major way to pay for college.State grants also require the FAFSA and possibly a supplemental state form accessible through the FAFSA or your state\u2019s education website \u2014 check your state\u2019s requirements. For example, New York offers the TAP grant via the FAFSA or the state Dream Act form if you\u2019re not FAFSA-eligible.Institutional scholarships and grants are trickier to find because they depend on you applying to colleges that offer money for your academic, financial or extracurricular profile. That takes research. Start by running the net price calculators on college websites. You can also check out these tools to find best-fit colleges.For private scholarships and grants, search locally first to minimize the competition (national scholarships draw thousands of applicants). Some scholarships require the FAFSA; many don\u2019t. For private grants, check out this list of resources, especially if you\u2019re a graduate student.Grants tend to simply require college financial aid forms \u2014 the FAFSA and maybe the CSS Profile \u2014 while scholarships run the gamut on requirements.Some colleges offer automatic scholarships for certain grades and test scores, and they don\u2019t need an extra application. Other college scholarships \u2014 and private scholarships \u2014 will require their own application. Possible requirements include:This fall, the FAFSA doesn\u2019t open until December (a one-time opening date to accommodate the new design and then the schedule will return to Oct. 1 in 2024). Some colleges also use the CSS Profile for awarding institutional grants, and that opens Oct. 1. States also have individual FAFSA deadlines, so check yours. This year, colleges and states will flex their deadlines to account for the later FAFSA opening.Some colleges offer scholarships with early deadlines \u2014 ask admissions offices about those so you don\u2019t miss them. Private scholarship deadlines vary widely with many having spring deadlines.It may sound clich\u00e9, but it is both never too early nor too late look for scholarships to apply to.Staying organized isn\u2019t easy, but it will help you manage the application process with a lot less stress. Track scholarship deadlines and completed submissions in some kind of spreadsheet. Here are some additional tips on how to stand out:Sometimes you come up empty-handed or don\u2019t receive enough money. Maybe your family doesn\u2019t qualify for financial aid at the colleges you applied to, or the scholarships you're awarded are small. What else can you do to pay for college?Work-study is an approved on-campus or off-campus job funded partly by federal or state work-study funds. Work-study is a need-based award, typically ranging from $2,000 to $5,000. Fill out the FAFSA to find out if you qualify. Once you receive work-study funds, you need to apply for a work-study job just like you apply for any job. Work-study jobs tend to be flexible, fitting in around your classes.Even if you\u2019re not awarded work-study, you can look for a non-work study job on-campus or off-campus to earn money for college.As a last resort, after exhausting all other free money, there are student loans. They come in two types: federal loans and private loans. The low-interest federal direct student loans come with annual limits, which are different for dependent and independent students.Then there are private student loans. You should always borrow federal loans first, because private loans don\u2019t offer the protections that federal student loans do, like income-driven repayment plans. Still, private loans may be necessary to cover funding gaps. Private loans can offer a lower interest rate for a good credit score.The Best Colleges in America, Rated by ValueParent PLUS Loans: A Guide to Helping Your Student Pay for College4 Myths About College Scholarships That Could Cost You","label":"FamilyFinance","link":"https:\/\/money.com\/scholarships-grants-for-college\/"},"86":{"index":8,"title":"Parent PLUS Loans: A Guide to Helping Pay for College | Money","date":1686614400000,"content":"A large portion of college students take out their own loans, turning to federal student loans and private loans, personal loans or even using credit cards to help pay for college. However, there are also many parents who want to pitch in \u2013 either to help their kids cover high educational expenses or because those young adults are unable to qualify for enough funding on their own.About 18% of parents borrowed money last year on their children\u2019s behalf to help pay for college, according to a recent survey by Sallie Mae. (That\u2019s down slightly from 21% in 2021.)

These loans can be used to pay for tuition and other qualifying educational expenses, such as room and board, books, supplies and fees.With a Parent PLUS loan, the parent is the borrower, rather than the student. This means that the parent is responsible for qualifying for the loan and repaying the loan once any deferment period ends.The maximum borrowing limit on a Parent PLUS loan is the actual cost of attendance (including tuition, room and board, fees, books and miscellaneous costs) as determined by the school, minus any other financial aid sources offered to the student (such as scholarships or grants). This means that you can borrow as much as you need to pay for college and all related educational expenses, as long as the parent borrower qualifies and doesn\u2019t have an adverse credit history. (More on that below)As with other federal student loans, Parent PLUS loans are disbursed directly to the school. If any funds remain after applicable tuition and educational expenses are paid, they will be issued back to the parent or, in select cases, to the student.Parent PLUS loans are issued with a fixed interest rate that remains the same for the duration of the loan repayment period. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the Parent PLUS interest rate is 8.05%.There is also an origination fee applied to Parent PLUS loans, which impacts the overall cost of the loan. This fixed, one-time fee is deducted from the initial disbursement of the funds; as of this writing, the fee on a Parent PLUS loan is 4.228%.With a Parent PLUS loan, loan repayment begins after funds are disbursed, unless the borrower requests to defer repayment until the student has graduated or withdrawn from school. In the case of a deferment, parent borrowers will have a six month grace period after the student graduates (or otherwise drops below half-time enrollment) before payments are due.Note that Parent PLUS loans are unsubsidized loans. This means that even with an approved loan deferment, interest will begin to accrue on the balance right away, regardless of the repayment term or deferment plan chosen.Parent PLUS loans may still be eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), if certain requirements are met after the student graduates. Parent borrowers can also consolidate their student debt with a Direct Consolidation Loan and even take advantage of the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan. This process combines all of your loan balances into one account with one interest rate (based on the average of each loan\u2019s rate), so it\u2019s a bit different than refinancing.When it comes to paying for college, the majority of parents help cover tuition and expenses for their student children. According to Sallie Mae, 75% of students will use a parent\u2019s current income, existing savings or a college savings plan to pay for at least some of their education, in addition to their own income and any available financial aid.If that isn\u2019t enough, though, parents and students may find themselves borrowing funds elsewhere. And a Parent PLUS loan isn\u2019t the only option.There are many for-profit banks and lenders that offer private student loans to borrowers and their parents. Because these loans aren\u2019t offered by the federal government, you can expect them to operate a bit differently.Loan terms vary by private lender. They may have fixed or variable interest rates, which may be higher than the rates offered on federal loans. They typically don\u2019t have an origination fee. The borrower (student or parent) will need to qualify based on income, credit score, and other personal factors; it may be more difficult to get approved for a private parent loan to pay for college than a federal one. On the other hand, if you have a high credit score, you may be able to qualify for a private loan with lower interest rates than PLUS loans. (Note that it\u2019s very hard for students to take a private loan on their own. Typically they need a cosigner with a longer credit history.)Private loans also don\u2019t offer the same protections as federal student loans, such as loan deferment and forbearance or income-driven repayment plans. However, the overall maximum loan amount may be higher with private loans, giving you the flexibility to cover a range of expenses while in school. This is because federal student loans may offer up to the total cost of attendance minus any existing aid. Private student loans, however, may allow you to still borrow up to the total cost of attendance, regardless of the aid offered.Parents with equity in their homes can also borrow against that value with a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit, also known as a HELOC.Both products work similarly: they allow you to borrow against a portion of your home\u2019s value, securing that debt with the equity you own. Because this debt is secured, it can sometimes be easier to get approved and may even come with a lower interest rate than an unsecured private loan.With that said, home equity loans and HELOCs are riskier for the borrower than student loans, as they are secured by your home. If you default on repayment, the lender could force a foreclosure on your home to recoup the debt.\nAds by Money.

This form should be filled out prior to the start of the current school year.You should sit down to figure out how much you need to borrow, and what monthly payments you can realistically afford. Consider all available funds that can go toward tuition and other school expenses: college savings, parent and student income, scholarships, grants, work study programs and more. This will give you a clear idea of how much you need to borrow.Once you know how much money you need, you can apply for a Parent PLUS loan. This can be done online through the Direct PLUS loan application site. A credit check will be run to determine eligibility, and the school will be contacted to verify enrollment and the cost of attendance.Parent borrowers with adverse credit histories may find it difficult to get approved for a PLUS loan, or may need to meet certain other requirements in order to qualify. Per the Department of Education, an adverse credit history includes one or more debts (totaling at least $2,085), which are either 90 days or more delinquent, have been placed in collections within the last two years, or were charged off in the last two years. It also includes things like a foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage garnishment, loan default or bankruptcy within the last five years.After approval, you will be asked to sign a PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note (aka a Direct PLUS Loan MPN) before any funds will be disbursed. This note is essentially your agreement to repay the borrowed funds according to the terms offered.Federal student borrowers can enjoy perks such as loan forgiveness programs and income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. But are parent borrowers eligible for the same benefits?Yes, some of these programs and benefits are available to parents, too. For instance, Parent PLUS borrowers can still choose between four different repayment plans:The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan is only available to parents who consolidate their Parent PLUS loans using a Direct Consolidation loan. This income-driven repayment plan is also a necessary step toward qualifying for loan forgiveness, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.Even if you don\u2019t work in a non-profit or government job that\u2019s needed to qualify for PSLF, the ICR plan has a maximum repayment term of 25 years. After that time, any remaining loan balance is forgiven.\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad.AdNeed some financial aid to cover tuition?

But it is also undeniably expensive.Experts say it\u2019s never too early to start thinking about college \u2014 where you want to attend, what you want to study and, of course, how you\u2019re going to pay for it.These questions often trouble people in their junior or senior years of high school, but experts say you can alleviate some of the dread by thinking about them sooner rather than later.No matter where you and your family are in your higher education journey, it's smart to make a financial plan that combines your savings and current income with student loans and \"free money\" from grants and scholarships.Don\u2019t know where to start? Our guide covers 11 strategies to help you pay for college.Table of contents:If you\u2019re a parent, relative or friend, you can set up savings accounts for a child\u2019s higher education expenses. The earlier you start with these, the better. Here are some of the most common options for college savings plans to consider.The most popular option is a 529 plan, formally referred to as a qualified tuition plan. Not only do many 529s come with state tax benefits, but withdrawals are also tax-free if used for certain education expenses. Qualified expenses include college tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment (like laptops).These plans are typically sponsored by states, though you can open accounts in states you don't live in.They come in two varieties. Prepaid tuition plans allow you to purchase future tuition at today's rates. College savings plans are investment accounts that grow over time.\nAds by Money.

Click below to sign up now.Start Saving Today\nAnother way to prepare for college costs is through a Coverdell education savings account, which is a trust or custodial account intended to cover certain school-related expenses for people under age 18. Coverdell savings grow tax-free, like 529s, and can be used for college as well as elementary and secondary education.But contributions are not tax-deductible and are capped at $2,000 a year for each beneficiary, depending on your family\u2019s income. The money generally has to be spent by the time the beneficiary is 30 years old.Alternatives include accounts under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (abbreviated UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA). These are considered more flexible options than a 529 or Coverdell because the funds can be used for anything \u2014 not only education expenses. Adults hold assets for a minor until they reach a certain age, at which point the account is transferred to them.Each type of account offers its own pros and cons, but in most cases, experts recommend 529 accounts over the other types for education savings. They offer possible state tax advantages as well as federal tax advantages, have higher contribution limits than Coverdell accounts and are counted more favorably under financial aid formulas than UGMAs.The U.S. government may be willing to help you pay your college bills by providing federal financial aid. Undergraduate students need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to receive a federal financial aid award, so be sure to do that as soon as possible.The FAFSA typically opens on Oct. 1 each year. (Things are different for the 2024-2025 FAFSA, though, which won\u2019t launch until December.)You technically have a while to fill it out. For the 2022-2023 school year, the federal deadline is June 30, 2023; for the 2023-2024 school year, it\u2019s June 30, 2024. But you shouldn't drag your feet \u2014 some institutions and states have different deadlines and may award aid on a first-come, first-served basis.To fill out the FAFSA, you'll need to gather your Social Security or Alien Registration Number, tax records, bank statements, investment records and documentation of untaxed income. You'll also need to create a Federal Student Aid account or FSA ID. Visit FAFSA.gov to get started.Experts recommend that you fill out the FAFSA \u2014 even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll qualify for need-based aid \u2014 because many institutions also use the data from the FAFSA to make decisions about their own aid.After you file your FAFSA, you\u2019ll first get a Student Aid Report, which is an estimate of how much federal aid you may receive. Later on, after you\u2019ve been accepted to a college, you'll receive an award letter that lays out grants and loans from the federal government, state and specific college you're looking at.Grants and scholarships are different from loans because you don\u2019t need to pay them back, meaning there\u2019s no need to worry about student loan payments. That\u2019s why you will often hear these types of financial aid called \u201cfree money.\u201dThe U.S. Department of Education runs the Pell Grant program, which gives money to students from low-income families. The specific amount you'll receive depends on your expected family contribution and your cost of attendance. For the 2022-2023 year, the maximum is $6,895. That maximum Pell Grant will be bumped to $7,395 for the 2023-2024 year.In addition to this federal assistance, each state provides additional financial aid.Florida, for example, has the Bright Futures Scholarship Program. Washington has the Washington College Grant, which \u2014 depending on your family\u2019s income \u2014 may cover full tuition costs at approved schools or career training programs.Schools also often offer what's called merit aid to students with certain standardized test scores or other academic achievements. At private colleges especially, this is a significant form of financial aid, totaling billions of dollars a year.Finally, you may want to take advantage of outside scholarships. Companies, nonprofits, foundations and other groups are constantly coming out with private scholarship opportunities that may offer free money with fewer strings attached than federal, state or institutional programs.The biggest challenge is finding them. Check with your high school guidance counselor to see if they know of any local scholarships you should pursue. From there, use a scholarship search engine like Niche or Fastweb to identify other grants you might be eligible for. They may require some elbow grease. But writing an essay or filming a creative video, for example, is arguably easier than paying for college out of pocket.Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of common sources of funding:It could make sense for you to pull money from a traditional savings account to cover the costs of college. This strategy may drain some of your savings, but it could help you avoid having to take out loans for your college expenses.Student loans typically have interest that may begin accruing while you\u2019re in school. If you can avoid paying interest by using cash from your savings to pay your bills up front, then it will decrease your total costs in the long run.Working during school is another way some students pay for college. Consider participating in the federal work-study (FWS) program, which gives part-time jobs to students in financial need. Work-study jobs pay at least the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25 per hour) but can pay more.Experts recommend you always answer \"yes\" when asked about your interest in work-study on the FAFSA. You don't have to take a work-study job that's ultimately offered to you in your financial aid letter, so by answering yes, you're simply keeping your options open.One thing to keep in mind: Not everyone is guaranteed a work-study job, and you'll only be approved for a limited amount of wages. Your school\u2019s financial aid office ultimately determines this based on the funding they received from the government and your FAFSA.You can also look for other options for work while in school. For example, you could land a student research position in your subject area to gain academic experience while earning income. Or you could look at job listings to see which employers are hiring in your area.After you've exhausted all of the options above, you may want to move on to private student loans. This will require some shopping around.When taking out private student loans, be careful, and do your research. In addition to having higher interest rates and fewer repayment options, private loans often involve credit checks and application fees. The income requirements for loan approval can also vary.Additionally, private student loans aren\u2019t eligible to receive the same benefits as federal loans.If you can\u2019t find a financial strategy that enables you to pay for your top-choice college, it may be time to look into alternative options. Not all colleges are created equal, especially when it comes to cost. For example, in-state fees for public institutions \u2014 which receive government funding \u2014 tend to be cheaper than fees for private schools \u2014 which rely on their students for revenue.For the 2022-2023 academic year, the College Board reports that the average published tuition and fees in the U.S. were $10,950 for in-state public schools and $28,240 for out-of-state public schools. Private non-profit schools cost $39,400 on average. (All of those figures are for four-year institutions.)Private, for-profit figures were not included, but those institutions typically charge even more. As you can see, different types of colleges come with drastically different price tags. The price will also vary considerably by state.In Wyoming, for example, in-state tuition and fees at public four-year colleges cost an average of $6,440 per year; in Vermont, they cost $17,650 per year, College Board data from the same year shows.There's also a difference between the listed price and what a student actually pays. A college's so-called \"sticker price\" is often a scary-large number that doesn't include financial aid. (Private colleges in particular end up discounting tuition, often by at least half, research shows.)In order to figure out what you\u2019ll actually pay, you'll want to look for a college's \"net price,\" which you can find with the help of institution-specific calculators or general tools like MyinTuition.org. It's better to use tools to get a personalized net price, rather than just looking at an average net price.And remember that you're not only on the hook for tuition and fees. The full cost of college also includes room, board, textbooks, transportation, health care... the list goes on.In rare cases, it could be more affordable to study abroad instead of going to a college in the U.S. It\u2019s no secret that universities are often more affordable elsewhere in the world. You may be able to find one that accepts American students at a significantly reduced tuition rate compared to what you would pay stateside.For example, Germany is known for offering a tuition-free public university education to international students. You just have to be accepted to study at a university and prove that you can cover your living expenses to be approved for a student visa.Studying abroad can be an incredibly enriching experience that helps you improve your language skills and broaden your horizons. However, you may need to speak a foreign language at a near-native level in order to qualify for admission to foreign universities, and some schools charge a higher average cost to international students. (Note that only some international schools participate in federal student loan programs. None participate in U.S. Education Department grant programs, so you won\u2019t be able to use a Pell Grant.)Plus, there are travel and moving costs to consider.Community college can be a cost-effective alternative to a traditional four-year university because its tuition costs are often significantly lower.Students can complete their first two years of schooling at a community college and then apply to transfer to a four-year university. This reduces the tuition costs for the first two years of your college degree. Your bachelor\u2019s degree will look the same regardless of whether you complete all four years at a traditional college or start at a community college.Community college can also be a way to bounce back from subpar academic performance in high school. If you have a strong GPA from your community college, it may help you qualify for admission to more selective universities when you\u2019re ready to transfer.In some circumstances, it may make sense to take a year off from college to save money. For example, if you\u2019re uninterested in community college but can\u2019t afford the cost of a four-year school yet, you could work and save for a year until you have enough funds.Some schools will grant you a deferral, which allows you to pause your studies for a year and retain your acceptance. Taking a gap year may also give you the chance to pursue passions, gain work experience or develop a better understanding of the type of work you would like to do when you eventually graduate from college.There are also high school programs that allow younger students to earn college credits before graduating. These programs can reduce the cost of college by decreasing the number of credits you need to take (and pay for) in order to earn your degree.Advanced Placement (AP) courses and College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests are two common ways to \u201ctest out\u201d of college classes. If you did well on your high school AP exams, you may be able to send your scores to a college to be counted as credit toward your degree. Most colleges will grant credit for popular AP courses, according to the College Board, but rules vary by college and academic department.About 2,900 colleges accept CLEP test scores, too, the College Board says. You must register to take these standardized tests, and depending on your scores, they may satisfy your college\u2019s general education requirements.CLEP is not as popular as the AP program, so be sure to check that your college accepts CLEP scores before you sign up to take an exam.Dual enrollment is another popular way to potentially reduce college costs \u2014 and help you graduate faster.Also known as concurrent enrollment or early college, these programs allow you to take college classes, usually at a nearby community college, while you\u2019re still in high school. Doing so allows you to earn high school credit and college credit at the same time.By the time you graduate high school, you\u2019ll have already knocked out some of your general education requirements for college.Every state except New York and Pennsylvania has statewide dual enrollment programs. Even so, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t dual-enroll in those two states. You still can, but the program will likely be run by specific colleges.Dual enrollment is often a cheaper alternative per credit hour than directly enrolling in a college after you graduate high school, and in many cases, it can be free. The price depends on many factors, though, and could be set by your state, your school district, or the college you\u2019re dually enrolled in.\nAds by Money.

A Student Loan can help.When you need a hand to cover the many costs that come with higher education, a Student Loan is a good option. Click below for more information.View Rates\nIf you\u2019re interested in lowering your tuition and associated enrollment expenses, applying your student\u2019s extra cash to these costs will only get you so far. Here are a few additional strategies.A good first step is to compare tuition and enrollment expenses across multiple colleges. Some will be much more affordable than others, which could impact where you choose to attend.It\u2019s also important to note that colleges may have different payment plans available. For example, one school may require a full tuition payment up front at the start of the academic year.; another may give you 12 months to pay off your tuition. This could be a meaningful distinction depending on how you pay for college.You may also be able to save money at your top choice school by living off campus instead of in student housing. Student housing may come with extra payments and charges for things like meal plans that you don\u2019t necessarily need to pay.Some students may be able to reduce their living expenses by renting a room near campus and buying their own groceries. However, living off campus won\u2019t always save you money, so it\u2019s important to compare your expected costs to the price of student housing before making a decision.If you can\u2019t bring your college expenses down any further, the next step is figuring out how to save or earn additional money to cover your mandatory costs. Here are a few tips for paying for college with this strategy.You can begin by increasing your savings. That means starting as early as possible and choosing a type of savings account that matches your financial goals and offers a high APY (annual percentage yield).If you want to save more money to pay for college, you can either reduce your expenses \u2014 by cutting back on things like eating out or travel \u2014 or bring in more money.Working while pursuing a college education may be what it takes for you to afford your top-choice college. However, that can be difficult to do while balancing your class schedule, extracurricular activities and social life.One option is to look for employment that allows you to work on your own schedule. You could be a food app delivery driver or find an online job that lets you set your own hours. Another option is to take advantage of online classes. These can be more flexible than in-person lectures because you are typically free to study at the hours that work for you instead of having to be physically present in class at a certain time.There may be ways to maximize your current income, as well. For example, if you\u2019re trying to save for a child\u2019s college expenses, you could negotiate a raise or ask for more responsibilities that might warrant a higher paycheck.There\u2019s also always the option of supplementing the work you do now with a second job. This is easier to do than ever, thanks to the abundance of online work-from-home opportunities, including finding freelancing jobs in your area of expertise and virtual positions.If you need to work a full-time job while taking classes, scheduling and time management will be very important. Be sure to set aside significant time to study and try to find a job that allows some flexibility. Flex time can be particularly helpful, as can work-from-home jobs that you can do on or close to campus. To qualify for federal student loans you must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (with some exceptions) and have financial need. The amount you get approved for will depend on your income, with higher earners qualifying for reduced aid. If you wish to be approved for Direct PLUS Parent loans, you can't have an adverse credit history. This means not having recent collections or significant past-due balances.There are plenty of ways to pay for college. We cover 11 strategies above \u2014 including grants, scholarships, jobs and loans as well as several ways to reduce the cost of college to make it more affordable in the first place \u2014 but these methods might not all be applicable to your situation. The most important thing is to carve out some time to make a financial plan that works for you and your family.\nSHOWHIDEAds by Money.

Using an official-looking IRS masthead, the scammers ask recipients to volunteer their personal information in order to receive their alleged refund.The fraud operation is well-timed: You may have tax refunds on the brain if you\u2019re one of the millions of Americans who are legitimately owed a refund by the IRS right now. The agency is holding nearly $1.5 billion of unclaimed refund money because roughly 1.5 million taxpayers didn\u2019t file their 2019 taxes. If you're one of them, you have until July 17 to manually file back taxes for that tax year to claim your money.But don\u2019t get confused.

The IRS will never try to reach out to you via email, phone call or text message regarding a bill or tax refund, nor will it ask you to send sensitive information this way.The second sign shows up in the actual copy. Scams masquerading as communications from a government agency will usually have misspellings, awkward phrasing and other glaring mistakes. This particular IRS mail scam claims taxpayers must provide \u201cfiling information\u201d to receive the tax refund and requests \"A Clear Phone of Your Driver's License That Clearly Displays All Four (4) Angles, Taken in a Place with Good Lighting.\"That's not the way a federal agency would capitalize an official message.The IRS says the letters also have strange punctuation and mismatched fonts, as well as incorrect information about tax filing deadlines. For instance, while the letters say the deadline for filing tax refunds is Oct. 17, the deadline for people on extension for their 2022 tax returns is actually Oct. 16. And taxpayers owed refunds from last year actually have time beyond that date.After telling recipients to include information like their cell number, bank routing information and Social Security number, the letter also incorrectly states that \"You'll Need to Get This to Get Your Refunds After Filing. These Must Be Given to a Filing Agent Who Will Help You Submit Your Unclaimed Property Claim.\u201dThe IRS says it doesn\u2019t handle \u201cunclaimed property.\u201d If you receive a fraudulent communication in the form of an email \u2014 also known as phishing \u2014 there may be links included, which you should not click on.Taxpayers shouldn\u2019t respond to scam messages or try to take action themselves.Instead, you can report tax-related scams by sending the email or a copy of a letter or text message as an attachment to phishing@irs.gov. Be sure to include any information the sender provided, like an email or phone number, as well as the date and time.You can also report scams via the Internet Crime Complaint Center or the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. See the IRS's Dirty Dozen list for information on specific scams, or visit the agency's phishing and online scams page for more information about protecting your information from security threats.Don't forget: If you're not sure whether a communication from the IRS is real, you can always directly contact the agency on your own and ask.
