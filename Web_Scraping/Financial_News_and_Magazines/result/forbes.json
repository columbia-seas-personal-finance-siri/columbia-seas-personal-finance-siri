Chris Christie and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Christie said Trump was afraid of defending his record and being on stage before referring to the former president as \u201cDonald Duck\u201d for avoiding the debate. Trump also decided to skip out on the first debate in August. A Tucker Carlson-hosted interview with the former president was posted around the same time the first debate aired. Trump took the opportunity to explain his reasons for skipping out on the debate, saying it was useless to do so because he was leading his competitors in the polls and didn\u2019t want to be pressed by people who \u201cshouldn\u2019t even be running for president.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading\n5 Takeaways From Last Night\u2019s GOP Debate\u2014Trump Skips, Ramaswamy Spars And Christie Name-Drops \u2018Donald Duck\u2019 (Forbes)\n\n\u2018They\u2019re Gutless\u2019: Trump Blasts Car Companies Over EV Pivot In Debate Counterprogramming Speech (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Antonio Peque\u00f1o IVEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions", "label": "Business", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2023/09/28/gop-debate-viewership-tumbles-25-from-first-event/"}, {"title": "Could Menendez Be Expelled From Senate?

As of Thursday evening, Fetterman is the only Democrat to say he would move to expel Menendez, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) hasn\u2019t called for Menendez to resign. He also has the support of many Republicans\u2014which would make getting two-thirds vote more difficult\u2014who are highlighting the fact that he is innocent until proven guilty, in what may be a move of political maneuvering to hurt Democrats. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted Tuesday that while the charges are \u201cserious and troubling,\u201d Menendez \u201chas a right to test the government\u2019s evidence in court, just like any other citizen. He should be judged by jurors and New Jersey\u2019s voters, not by Democratic politicians who now view him as inconvenient to their hold on power.\u201d\nBig Number\n14. That\u2019s how many of the 15 Senate expulsions since 1789 were related to the Civil War and representatives having support for the Confederate rebellion.\n\nKey Background\nMenendez and his wife were indicted last Friday on charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right and conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. They are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in the form of cash, gold bars and a luxury car in exchange for favors from three New Jersey businessmen. In 2015, Menendez was indicted on bribery charges related to a Florida ophthalmologist who reportedly gave him $1 million in gifts and campaign donations in exchange for political influence, but his trial ended in a hung jury and the charges against him were dismissed. Menendez has continued to deny the new allegations against him and resisted calls to resign, saying that \u201cfor years, forces behind the scenes have repeatedly attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave,\u201d and calling the investigation \u201can active smear campaign.\u201d\n\nFurther ReadingThe HillFetterman says he would vote to expel Menendez from the SenateNytimesMenendez Rejects Democrats' Calls to Resign, Prompting Talk of Expulsion\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0Molly BohannonEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions", "label": "Business", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/09/28/could-menendez-be-expelled-from-senate-heres-what-the-process-would-look-like/"}, {"title": "Trump Reverses Course: Won\u2019t Try Moving His Georgia Case To Federal Court", "date": "2023-09-28", "content": "Updated Sep 28, 2023, 07:02pm EDTShare to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nFormer President Donald Trump will no longer seek to have his Georgia election interference case moved to federal court, opening up the former president to a televised criminal trial, a less favorable jury and the chance to pardon himself if he\u2019s convicted after being reelected.\nTrump was booked in August on multiple charges related to an alleged plan to overturn the results of ...

Georgia\u2019s RICO statute prohibits racketeering or conspiring to do so and is punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment between five and 20 years. A total of 41 counts were brought against 19 defendants in the election interference case. One of those defendants, Mark Meadows, attempted to move his case to federal court but was denied by U.S. District Court Judge Steve Jones, who said Meadows failed to meet the \u201cquite low\u201d threshold needed to move the case out of Georgia.

Using that money, the golf startup was able to lure some of the PGA Tour\u2019s best-known golfers, including Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson, kicking off a messy legal fight between the two. Eventually, the PGA Tour forbade its golfers from participating in LIV Golf events, forcing players to pick between the two. Throughout it all, LIV Golf was accused of being a \u201csportswashing\u201d operation by the Saudi government, which critics argued was using the golf league to distract from its human rights abuses. This came to an end in June when the two suddenly announced a merger. That deal has been heavily scrutinized, including by politicians in Washington. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told a group of PGA executives the deal gives the Saudi government \u201cfinancial dominance\u201d because they \u201ccontrol the purse strings\u201d during a hearing in July.\n\nTangent\nThis also appears to be an attempt by Endeavor and Fenway to expand their portfolios in the sports industry. Endeavor, which is based in Beverly Hills, California, just completed its takeover of the popular wrestling label WWE. And Fenway Sports Group, which is run in part by founder John Henry, is based in Boston and commands a massive sports portfolio, owning properties like Liverpool FC, New England Sports Network and Nascar's Roush Fenway Racing, in addition to its marquee team: the Boston Red Sox. A deal with the PGA Tour would add to its burgeoning golf investments. It was a partner in the PGA Tour\u2019s Deutsche Bank Championship, and in August partnered with the Ladies Professional Golf Association. It also invested in TMRW Sports, which is launching a new Tiger Woods-backed golf league called TGL, and owns the TGL Boston team.\nForbes Valuation\nWe estimate Fenway Sports Group Founder John Henry to be worth $5.1 billion, and we estimate KKR & Co. co-founder Henry Kravis to be worth $8.9 billion.\n\nFurther Reading\nHenry Kravis, Endeavor, Fenway Eye PGA Tour Deal to Rival Saudi Arabia\u2019s (Bloomberg)\nPGA Tour And Saudi-Backed LIV Golf Agree To Sudden Merger (Forbes)\nThe PGA Tour Wants U.S. Money As Insurance For Opposition Of Saudi LIV Golf Takeover (Forbes)\nSaudi Public Investment Fund Reports $11 Billion In 2022 Losses\u2014But Sports Investments Might Not Be To Blame (Forbes)\nTiger Woods Joins PGA Tour Board Ahead Of Saudi Merger\u2014Expresses Confidence In Maligned PGA Commissioner Jay Monahan (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0William SkipworthEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions", "label": "Business", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/09/28/pga-attracting-red-sox-and-wwe-owners-as-possible-alternative-to-saudi-investment/"}, {"title": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance World Tour Shatters Record For Highest-Grossing Month, Report Says", "date": "2023-09-28", "content": "Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nSinger Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s world tour raked in $179 million in a single month, according to Billboard, far surpassing a previous monthly record set by her and setting the stage for her to join the likes of Coldplay and Rolling Stone on the list of artists with the highest-grossing tours.\nBeyonc\u00e9's Renaissance World Tour is reportedly the highest-grossing tour by a woman.

An elephant named Tarra was used to entertain people in the 1980\u2019s, including in an act where she rode roller skates, according to the Nonhuman Rights Project. Years later, in 1995, she was moved to The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and became its first resident.\nTangent\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project is working at the state and county level to \u201cdemand recognition of the legal personhood and fundamental right to bodily liberty\u201d of a number of species including great apes, elephants, dolphins and whales that the nonprofit says are held in captivity throughout the U.S. Jane Goodall is among the members of the organization\u2019s board working toward that goal. Earlier this summer, for example, the nonprofit filed a petition in Colorado arguing that five elephants housed at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, Colorado, had the right to liberty and should be released to a sanctuary.\n\nCrucial Quote\nCourtney Fern, Director of Government Relations for the Nonhuman Rights Project, called the legislation \u201chistoric,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s indisputable that elephants suffer when deprived of their freedom and that animal welfare laws can\u2019t end their suffering.\u201d\nChief Critic\nJustin Barker, a political analyst focused on animal and wildlife-related laws, told the California Globe the \u201cOjai law is kind of crazy and is only inviting someone to bring an elephant there and directly challenge it.\u201d Barker compared the Ojai ordinance to lawsuits in the early 90s to protect spotted owls in the Pacific Northwest. A federal court ruling in 1991 closed some parts of the Northwest woods to logging; Barker said loggers who were not happy about the ruling responded in \u201cborderline legal ways\u201d like physically moving the birds.

Glenn Youngkin as a 2024 alternative to former President Donald Trump, according to a Washington Post opinion piece by journalist Robert Costa, as a cast of GOP candidates continue to slump in the polls and as Youngkin emerges in the national spotlight as a rumored 2024 candidate and occasional Trump antagonist.\nVirginia Governor Glenn Youngkin at George Mason University in May.Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nYoungkin hasn't formally thrown his hat in the ring and has shrugged off previous calls for him to run for president, but a group of GOP donors are strategizing behind the scenes to draft him in 2024, with meetings planned in the coming weeks, Costa reported in the Post.\n\n\n\nA Harvard University graduate and former co-CEO of investment firm the Carlyle Group whose net worth Forbes estimated at $470 million in 2021, Youngkin entered Virginia politics in January 2021 when he announced his gubernatorial campaign.\n\n\n\n\nHe spent $5.5 million of his own money and ultimately defeated former Virginia Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe with 50.6% of the vote\u2014a major win for Republicans that placed Youngkin in the national spotlight, one year after Trump lost Virginia by 10 points.\n\n\n\nYoungkin, who cannot run for reelection immediately after his gubernatorial term ends in 2026, campaigned as a self-proclaimed \u201cpolitical outsider with proven business experience,\u201d drawing parallels to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and winning Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\n\nSince winning the gubernatorial election, Youngkin has signed a slew of conservative bills, including a ban on school mask mandates, pushed for a 15-week abortion ban and issued guidelines on transgender students in schools limiting bathroom and locker room use based on students\u2019 sex at birth, which has been decried by LGBTQ advocates.\n\n\n\nYoungkin\u2019s transgender policy, which also requires teachers to address students by their birth names, has drawn support from conservatives, with a lawsuit filed earlier this month by two mothers in Virginia Beach who argued a local school board failed to follow the policy and violated parents\u2019 rights to \u201cmake basic decisions about the education and well-being of their children.\u201d\n\n\nYoungkin was also courted by former Fox chair Rupert Murdoch on at least two occasions this year, the Washington Post reported, as Murdoch\u2019s relationship with Trump soured in the wake of the 2020 election, with Murdoch asking Youngkin to run for the White House.\n\n\n\n\nNews Peg\nRepublican donors will reportedly meet next month at a Virginia Beach hotel in a closed-door retreat nicknamed the Red Vest Retreat\u2014a nod to his iconic red vest donned during his gubernatorial campaign\u2014to support a Youngkin presidential campaign, CBS News election correspondent Robert Costa in a Washington Post op-ed published Thursday afternoon. Officially, the meeting will focus on a push for full GOP control of the Virginia General Assembly. One billionaire GOP donor, Thomas Peterffy\u2014the world\u2019s 54th richest person with a net worth of $28 billion\u2014told Costa he has already donated \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to Youngkin\u2019s political action committee, saying he believes Younkin \u201cappears to be leaving the door open.\u201d\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\nWhether Youngkin will enter the race. Despite the speculation, Youngkin has sidestepped the question, saying this week he was \u201chumbled\u201d by the rumors but wants to focus on Virginia, a point he has reiterated throughout the 2020 election cycle.\nTangent\nA Youngkin presidential campaign would add the Virginia governor to a laundry list of GOP presidential hopefuls, though as of this week, no GOP candidate aside from Trump comes close to taking the lead in early primary polls, even as Trump faces four indictments and as he skips the first two GOP primary debates. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was previously favored by some top donors as a Trump alternative, but he has struggled in the polls and taken stances on Ukraine and business that alienated some former backers, causing heavyweights like billionaire Ken Griffin to back away. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s weighted average, Trump is dominating the field with 54% of likely Republicans supporting him, over 13.8% for DeSantis and 6.3% for Vivek Ramaswamy and former South Carolina Gov.

Trump has taken a similar tack with a handful of other former allies, including DeSantis, a 2024 Trump rival whose rise he has repeatedly taken credit for. In a statement on Truth Social in November, Trump claimed he \u201cgot MAGA to Vote\u201d for Youngkin,\u201d arguing the governor would not have \u201ccome close to winning\u201d otherwise and that he \u201cknows that.\u201d\nSurprising Fact\nYoungkin tip-toed around Trump\u2019s baseless election fraud theories following Trump\u2019s loss to President Joe Biden in 2020.

Engoron issued the Tuesday ruling after James\u2019 office filed a motion\u2014which Trump\u2019s legal team opposed\u2014seeking a summary judgment in the case, arguing a trial was unnecessary in order to find Trump guilty. Engoron wrote that Trump and his co-defendants were living in \u201ca fantasy world, not the real world\u201d when they lied about the size and worth of his properties, including Mar-A-Lago, his 40 Wall Street skyscraper in downtown Manhattan and estate in Westchester County, New York.\nFurther Reading\nDid Judge Kill The Trump Organization?

(Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nApple argued the lower court\u2014the District Court for the Northern District of California\u2014doesn't have the authority to make such a ruling.\n\n\n\nIt went on to point out that the Supreme Court, specifically Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett, have opined that some courts are overstepping their bounds by making judgements that affect the entire country as opposed to their specific jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\nApple also argued this kind of case brought forth by a single plaintiff, as opposed to a class action lawsuit, cannot have such a broad impact on the entirety of Apple's millions of app developers nationwide because only Epic Games sued and the court didn't prove all the other developers were harmed.\n\n\n\nIt also argued that since Epic Games and its products are no longer on the App Store, (Apple removed them from the store amidst the companies\u2019 feuds over the policy in question) they no longer have standing to sue.\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nThe two companies\u2019 legal battle began in 2020 after Apple, maker of the iPhone, removed Epic Games, maker of Fortnite, from its App Store for giving a discount to players who used its own payments system rather than Apple\u2019s App Store for in-game purchases\u2014known as \u201canti-steering provisions.\u201d Epic Games, which wants to avoid the 30% commission and circumvent Apple\u2019s system, sued in a California federal court, arguing that Apple had a monopoly over mobile gaming. Specifically, Epic Games argued that Apple\u2019s policies of forbidding third-party app marketplaces, charging a 30% commission on purchases through its own App Store, and these anti-steering provisions were a violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In 2021, after a trial, a federal judge sided with Apple on most of the claims, determining that it did not have a monopoly over mobile gaming and could continue forbidding third-party marketplaces and charging commission. However, the judge decided that Apple\u2019s anti-steering provisions violated California state laws against unfair competition. That change has been put on hold, though, while the appeal process plays out. Epic Games and Apple both appealed the decision, hoping to each reverse the side of the ruling they lost, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision.\n\nTangent\nEpic Games also wants to see this case go before the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the company filed its own petition to the Supreme Court requesting the court hear the case.\nWhat To Watch For\nThe Supreme Court could decide by January whether it is going to take up the case, per its regular schedule.\n\nFurther Reading\nFortnite Maker Asks Supreme Court To Review Apple Monopoly Ruling (Forbes)\nFollow me on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0LinkedIn.\u00a0Send me a secure\u00a0tip.\u00a0William SkipworthEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions", "label": "Business", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/willskipworth/2023/09/28/apple-asks-supreme-court-to-overturn-ruling-in-epic-games-legal-battle/"}, {"title": "Billionaire And Celebrity Real Estate: Here's Which Homes Hit The Market This Week", "date": "2023-09-28", "content": "Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinTopline\nFrom Nashville to Hollywood, the celebrity real estate market is on a hot streak this week with the likes of Elton John, Cooper Kupp, and James Packer listing their multi-million-dollar mansions with amenities from wine cellars to saunas and theater rooms.\nA Beverly Hills estate owned by billionaire James Packer is listed for $85 million by agents ...

Gaetz has cited a string of demands of which he says McCarthy has fallen short, including passing a balanced budget and holding a vote on term limits for lawmakers.

Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty\n\nKey Facts\n\n\nOn Thursday, New York state Justice Nicholas Moyne dismissed Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub\u2019s attempt to bar the city from implementing the rule\u2014which mandates the companies pay food delivery workers a flat hourly rate of $17.96 or pay 50 cents a minute per delivery.\n\n\n\nMoyne did, however, exempt Relay Delivery, a small delivery service company that joined the suit, from Thursday\u2019s ruling, after the company argued it would be put out of business with the cost increase from the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Background\nThe law was scheduled to go into effect July 12, but legal challenges delayed its start. Earlier this summer, Moyne temporarily halted the law from going into effect and allowed Uber, DoorDash and Grubhub to make additional filings in the case. The food delivery companies argued the added costs of higher wages could pass on additional costs to customers and restaurants and ultimately hurt opportunities for workers. Meanwhile, New York City\u2019s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection argued the law would give delivery workers \u201cfair pay for their labor.\u201d The legislation is one of many efforts nationwide to extend minimum pay rules and other job protections for gig workers, like those at Uber and DoorDash, who are typically independent contractors and exempt from many laws that apply to traditional employees. New York City\u2019s legislation, along with efforts in other states like California and Minnesota, aim to fill that gap. Over the summer in Minneapolis, local officials launched an effort to grant Uber and Lyft more worker protects including giving drivers a minimum wage, but that effort was vetoed by the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey.\n\nBig Number\n60,000. That\u2019s how many food delivery workers New York City has, according to the New York Times. Those workers are paid an average of about $11 an hour with tips and expenses, the Times reported.\nSurprising Fact\nThis is the country\u2019s first minimum pay-rate for delivery workers, according to the Times.\n\nTangent\nAlso on Thursday, California Gov.

Although the rate is among the highest in the country, workers have taken issue with the gap between it and California\u2019s living wage, which is $21.24 for one single adult or $43.44 for an adult with one child, according to MIT\u2019s living wage calculator. California legislators passed a separate bill for healthcare workers this month that would bring the minimum wage to $25. If passed, the law won\u2019t apply to doctors and nurses but will include those who do everything else at hospitals, dialysis clinics and other healthcare facilities, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFurther Reading\nCalifornia Gov.

That\u2019s about how many wheelchairs United carried on flights in 2022, the company said. During the past four years, United and United Express carriers mishandled wheelchairs at a rate of 1.2%, making them third-best among domestic carriers tracked, according to the DOT agreement.\n\nKey Background\nFigueroa was an advocate for disability rights and was on her way home from lobbying Congress about disability rights in Washington, D.C. on a United flight, when her custom chair\u2014valued at around $30,000\u2014was ruined. The lawsuit filed on her behalf alleges she was forced to sit in a non-motorized courtesy wheelchair for hours, which supposedly reopened a wound and caused \u201cmuscle cramps and spasms.\u201d In a filing from May, United disputed the liability and damages claims and that \u201cany act or omission of United was the proximate cause of Decedent\u2019s injuries or death.\u201d The suit alleges United refused to pay for a replacement chair until Figueroa contacted her local senators and got them involved in filing a complaint, after which they agreed to get a chair but got it to her too late as her condition had worsened. She died on October 31, 2021, a little over three months after her United flight.\nTangent\nThe Biden Administration has taken a particular interest in improving infrastructure accessibility.

In August, both Hyundai and Kia recalled some 92,000 vehicles, including the Hyundai Elantra (2023), Hyundai Kona (2023), Hyundai Palisade (2023-24), Hyundai Sonata (2023), Hyundai Tucson (2023), Kia Seltos (2023-23), Kia Soul (2023) and Kia Sportage (2023), due to oil pumps that could overheat and catch fire. In March, they made a similar plea for owners to park outdoors and away from other cars, homes and buildings when they both recalled over 570,000 vehicles released between 2019 and as late as this year for fear they could catch fire, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Kia, specifically, had to recall 188,912 of its 2021-23 Kia K5 models due to side curtain airbags potentially deploying improperly and causing injury during a crash.\n\nSurprising Fact\nAlong with a spate of car recalls, both Kia and Hyundai are being sued by the city of Chicago for allegedly not having specific security technology within their cars that the city says led to a car theft crisis. About 17 cities are suing the automakers for similar reasons, though they have pushed for a U.S. judge to reject them, claiming other factors like city policing policies and TikTok videos that teach people how to break in certain Kia and Hyundai models are to blame for the uptick in car theft, according to Reuters. \nTangent\nRecalled Hyundai models this week include the Accent (2012-15), Azera (2012-15), Elantra (2011-15), Elantra Coupe (2013-15), Equus (2014-15), Genesis Coupe (2011-15), Santa Fe (2013-15), Santa Fe Sport (2013), Sonata HEV (2011-15), Tucson (2010-13), Tucson Fuel Cell (2015), Veloster (2012-15) and Veracruz (2010-12).

Republicans have claimed without solid evidence that Biden abused his powers to financially benefit himself and his family members, citing bank records that detail his son Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings.\nTangent\nAmong the most explosive allegations Republicans have launched against Biden is an FBI whistle-blower\u2019s claim that the president and his son accepted a bribe from an executive at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma in exchange for then vice president Biden to advocate for the ouster of then Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who Republicans have claimed was investigating Burisma. The claim is fraught with factual fallacies, however. The FBI has not verified the whistle-blower allegation, and a former Shokin official said Burisma was not under investigation at the time.

Gannett posted a massive wage range, saying the job pays somewhere between $21.63 and $50.87 an hour. \u201cExact compensation may vary based on skills, experience, location, and union representation, if applicable,\u201d the company noted.\nKey Background\nIt\u2019s been a major year for Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter and Taylor Swift. Beyonc\u00e9 was the most nominated artist at the 2023 Grammys. With 28 total wins in her career, she has become the woman with the most Grammy awards of all time. The \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d singer also made history with her Renaissance world tour, which brought in $127.6 million over 11 shows in July\u2014the largest one-month sum for any singer since the mid-\u201880s, according to Billboard. In addition to the success of her Eras tour, an upcoming film of the concert and an upcoming re-release of 1989, Swift has also had a busy year. The \u201cShake It Off\u201d artist brought in $2.2 billion in North American ticket sales alone and is also reportedly earning over $8.5 million per month in streaming royalties for her three album re-releases, which she recorded again due to royalty and ownership disputes.\nForbes Valuation\nBoth women are on Forbes\u2019 Self-Made Women of 2023 List, with Swift\u2019s estimated net worth valued at $740 million and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s at $540 million.\n\nTangent\nOn TikTok, users have shared the job postings for both singer-songwriters, adding that this could be a prime opportunity to attend concerts that were otherwise difficult to find tickets for due to demand drastically exceeding supply\u2014leading to steep price points. Fans struggled to nab Taylor Swift Eras tour resale tickets for an average of $1,619 on SeatGeek, while Beyonc\u00e9 tickets ranged from $102 on the lower end to around $1,401 and up for BeyHive VIP packages, depending on the seat and venue. Prospective candidates spend hours on their applications to USA TODAY, with 24-year-old journalist Lexi Thompson telling the Journal she spent six hours creating her Legally Blonde-style application video. The two job postings also come at a peculiar time for Gannett, which experienced a mass exodus among senior and executive roles, in addition to multiple recent layoff rounds.

The XFL was launched in 2001 as a joint venture between NBC and World Wrestling Entertainment, before the league was closed after its first season. Vince McMahon spent $200 million to launch the league again in 2020, though the effort was cut short after five weeks because of the pandemic. An ownership group that included Johnson, Dany Garcia and RedBird Capital Partners subsequently purchased the league for $23.5 million, including $8.5 million to settle previous XFL debt.
