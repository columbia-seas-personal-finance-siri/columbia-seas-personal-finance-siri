A colossal shortfall in retirement savings is shaping up to be a financial burden that will ultimately affect all taxpayers.Retirees, taxpayers and both the federal and state governments will suffer at the hands of the looming retirement crisis that research from Pew Charitable Trusts released earlier this year says will cost over $1.3 trillion by 2040.However, the non-governmental organization suggests that there's an underutilized solution that could relieve much of the burden: state-run individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, which could help workers save for retirement and enable the government to avoid covering the hefty shortfalls.These programs would allow private employers without the means to create their own retirement savings programs to offer employees an automated IRA. As it stands, only 11 states have adopted these programs.\nAds by Money.

It adds that state governments will be cumulatively burdened by $334 billion over the same time span.These sizable costs are what governments would need to pay to properly address a boom in public assistance demand if things continue as they are. Pew says that this demand would also lead to an increased burden on taxpayers due to decreasing revenues and a drop in quality of life for retirees.What's more, the Pew Trusts estimate that the ratio of retirement-age households to working-age households will grow by 46% between now and 2040. This means that the burden of this $1.3 trillion shortfall will be borne by a smaller population of working-age taxpayers.According to Pew, \"the study estimated the cumulative additional taxpayer liability because of insufficient retirement savings to be $13,600 per household.\"\nAds by Money.

Click below to learn more.Start Investing\nThis data may seem bleak, but as the Pew Trusts point out, there is a solution being undertaken by some states: automated savings programs, or automated IRAs.Some private employers, especially small businesses, are not able to offer employer-based retirement savings options like 401(k)s due to high administrative and financial costs. Auto-IRAs take automatic payroll deductions from employees and roll them into a retirement savings plan that bears no cost on the employer. Employees are typically automatically enrolled in these programs, though they can easily opt out.The research estimates that the average worker need only put aside an extra $140 per month over a 30-year period to help offset the retirement savings gap and largely erase this $1.3 trillion crisis. As it stands now, 11 states (and the city of Seattle, Washington) have implemented auto-IRAs. Four of these states have already seen average monthly savings grow to or above $140 per month.If households could save this much in retirement accounts, \"they could erase the retirement savings gap, eliminate the extra taxpayer burden, and help people maintain their lifestyles in retirement,\" the Pew report states.Pennsylvania is not among the states who have an auto-IRA program, though a bi-partisan group of lawmakers is trying to bring one to the Commonwealth.The proposed Keystone Saves Program Act would make Pennsylvania the twelfth state to offer an auto-IRA. According to the Keystone Saves Coalition, an interest group trying to bring auto-IRAs to the state, and that also includes the Pew Charitable Trusts as a member, says the proposed auto-IRA program would help the state to reduce an estimated $17.8 billion windfall it will be tasked with paying over the next 17 years.\nNewsletterRetire with MoneyRetire With Money brings the latest retirement news, insights, and advice to your inbox.

Fixed-rate annuities, which are typically funded years in advance in a lump sum or multiple payments, are another popular option.Fixed annuities offer guaranteed income when a worker retires, either in a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual payment, for the rest of the contract holder\u2019s life. In other words, annuities are essentially like a regular paycheck in retirement that you can collect alongside monthly Social Security payments and other income.Combining a 401(k) with an annuity allows retirees to reap the benefits of an investment that produces capital gains and one that produces a steady, fixed income stream \u2014 aka \u201cblended\u201d income.\nAds by Money.

The majority of blended-income retirees are enjoying retirement more than those who only have investments or annuity income. What\u2019s more, the guarantee of lifetime income provided by annuities can help protect retirees from outliving their savings.But there are drawbacks to annuities, like expensive upfront sales fees and annual fees between 1% and 3% of the annuity price, according to insurance company Nationwide.Annuities also aren\u2019t liquid, so if a contract holder tries to withdraw money within the first few years, they\u2019re subject to a \u201csurrender\" fee that reduces the value of their investment. You also have to pay taxes and fees on annuity income because it\u2019s regarded the same way as the earnings you receive while you\u2019re working.The Goldman Sachs report shows that many Americans are struggling with a \u201cfinancial vortex,\u201d or competing costs like swelling debt, higher education and student loans that make it difficult to save for retirement at all.

It's the latest in a long line of research that shows, on average, college does pay off financially.\nAds by Money.

(Money\u2019s Best Colleges list can help you find schools that are worth the money.) Ultimately, how good of an investment you make depends in part on how much you pay \u2014 and to pick the right college at the right amount, you first have to understand how college pricing works.Here are four myths about college costs and what experts say you need to know to make your higher education experience worth it:On the websites of the country\u2019s most expensive colleges, you\u2019ll see exorbitant estimates for the full cost of attendance: the University of Southern California, for example, now lists the total price as $90,921 \u2014 for a single year.Figures like that can discourage folks into thinking a college education isn\u2019t worth it or is out of reach. But the reality is that only a fraction of students \u2014 less than a third in the case of USC \u2014 pay full price.The majority of students, at USC and across the country, receive grants and scholarships that reduce what they have to pay. This is called the net price of attendance in higher education lingo.Nationally, students actually paid an average price of $28,660 at private nonprofit four-year colleges, counting tuition, fees, room and board, and other costs for the most recent school year, according to College Board research. The figure is almost half that, $14,560, at public four-year colleges. (USC, for what its worth, still lands on the expensive side; the average net price is about $36,800.)Jackie Copeland, associate provost and director of scholarships and student aid at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says the difference between sticker price and real price is \u201cone of the biggest things that we attempt to get through to families when we have the opportunity to speak with them directly.\u201dShe recommends families use net price calculators before applying to receive financial aid estimates based on their income, tax and household information.Lydia McNeiley, college and career coordinator for a school district in Hammond, Indiana, says greater awareness that advertised prices aren\u2019t what you\u2019ll typically have to pay could help college seem more feasible to many of her students, who would be the first in their families to go. Nearly 80% of the district\u2019s students are economically disadvantaged, so cost is a primary concern.Many of her students, in fact, don't realize there are state programs like the 21st Century Scholars that could cover their tuition at a public school like Purdue University.You might be surprised just how much a family can earn while still qualifying for need-based aid at some schools, particularly selective colleges that tend to have greater financial resources.A handful of elite schools are basically free for families with incomes below $75,000 (or higher thresholds in some cases) and that includes tuition, room and board, and more. At several institutions, full-tuition scholarships are available to most families earning up to $150,000.It doesn't stop there, either: At Stanford University, which has one of the most generous need-based aid programs, even families earning between $225,000 to $250,000 get a break: The average scholarship and grant amount for this income bracket is $33,800 per year, which reduces their average net cost to $50,060. For families with multiple kids in college, need-based aid is available at income levels above $300,000.The challenge with these wealthy, elite institutions, of course, is getting in. If you don't, there are many private colleges that focus a significant portion of their financial aid on non-need-based aid, more commonly called merit aid.At the University of Dayton, for example, 43% of students without any financial need receive merit grants, and the average amount is nearly $25,000.When you're researching colleges, you can look for schools that meet financial need with no-loan commitments, as well as colleges that meet 100% of students' financial need, which generally means their financial aid packages exclude private loans, unsubsidized federal loans, or parent PLUS loans. Or, if you're looking for colleges where you can get in and qualify for a significant merit grant, try looking for schools that give out significant merit awards and where you're at the top of the academic profile of admitted students. (Many colleges will share a class profile on their websites or you can search for a college's \"Common Data Set\" to look up statistics of incoming students.)\nAds by Money.

Click below for more information.View Rates\nWhile in-state public schools are generally among the lowest cost options for students, you don\u2019t have to limit your search there if you\u2019re looking for a low price.Robert Lovvorn, a college counselor at Riverdale High School in Portland, Oregon, says students who are focused on finding an affordable college are increasingly looking beyond their state schools. Tuition costs have risen so much at the University of Oregon and Oregon State University that other colleges are looking more affordable, he says.It can sometimes cost about the same for a student to attend a public school in another state in the Northwest, like Montana State, thanks to tuition reciprocity agreements between nearby states. Add on any scholarships, and out-of-state schools can become cheaper than in-state options, Lovvorn says.At UNC, Copeland agrees that costs aren\u2019t always higher for out-of-state students. Non-resident students whose families are within 200% of the federal poverty guidelines can be eligible for the university\u2019s Carolina Covenant program, which qualifies them for debt-free financial aid packages.Private universities can also be cheaper for students who\u2019ll receive aid, especially in a states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Vermont, where public universities are comparatively expensive. Looking at the University of Pittsburgh and Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, you'll find the estimated price for students who receive aid is slightly lower, at $22,400, at the small private college, compared to the estimated in-state price for students who receive aid at the large public, $24,700. Dickinson\u2019s full tuition is higher, but over 90% of students receive grants or scholarships.At public universities in areas with higher costs of living that also have relatively low tuition prices for in-state students, the cost of room and board can trump the price of tuition.Schools like the University of Florida and California State University, Los Angeles are examples of universities that publish room and board costs that are actually quite a bit higher than their in-state tuition prices.Room and board costs have been soaring lately with inflation. In April, Michigan State University officials announced a nearly 7% increase for the upcoming year as they reported that their food costs were up 25%, according to MLive.It's a similar story pretty much nationwide, according Jim Hundrieser, vice president for consulting and business development at the National Association of College and University Business Officers.Even though some schools have made only modest tuition increases this year, \u201calmost all of them are having to look towards a room and board increase to pay for those increases in utilities, construction or renovations, upkeep, food, staffing,\u201d Hundrieser says.\nAds by Money.

But don't just CTRL+F your desired college's website for a dollar figure \u2014 that'll likely give you the sticker price. What you actually need to know is the net price, which is how much you'll pay after grants and scholarships are figured in.That number will help you map out how much you need to borrow for all four years of college.You can use a net price calculator to get an estimate. Search for the college you\u2019re interested in on the Education Department's website here to find specific prices. You can also look up average net prices by income using the College Navigator tool.Though these tools can give you a general idea of how much you can expect to pay for college, everyone's situation is different. For net price calculators and similar pricing tools, the accuracy of the estimate will depend on how detailed and accurate the information you provide about your income and assets is. People who are eligible for federal aid can get a better sense of costs when they fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).To submit the FAFSA, you\u2019ll need documents like your family's tax records, bank statements and investment records. The FAFSA also requires a Federal Student Aid account (called an FSA ID). Go to fafsa.gov to get started.The application typically opens in the fall ahead of the year you\u2019ll be using the money, and it can be submitted until the end of the academic year. However, many states and schools award aid on a first-come, first-served basis. They also may have their own priority deadlines. That's why you're encouraged to do the FAFSA as soon as you can every fall.Once you've turned in your FAFSA, you'll receive what's called a student aid report. The student aid report will display a measure of your family\u2019s finances and indicate whether you qualify for need-based financial aid, like a federal Pell Grant.After you've been accepted to a college, you'll typically get a financial aid award letter that explains the combination of grants, scholarships and government loans you've been deemed eligible for. (Read more about how to get free money for college here.) It'll also give you instructions on how to accept, or confirm, your financial aid.There are two major types of student loans: federal and private. Federal student loans are made by the government and overseen by the U.S. Department of Education, whereas private student loans are made by banks or other financial institutions.Experts generally recommend consumers stick with the federal loan program rather than going the private route because the government provides more opportunities for relief if borrowers end up struggling with repayment. Federal student loans may also have lower interest rates than private student loans, and they're available regardless of your financial standing or credit history.Direct subsidized loans are for undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. One notable quirk is that the federal government pays the interest on these loans while you're enrolled in college and during a six-month grace period after you graduate.(Note: Since March 2020, federal student loan payments have been paused and interest hasn\u2019t accrued for millions of borrowers, however, that is scheduled to end later this summer after the Supreme Court weighs in on the Biden administration\u2019s loan forgiveness plan.)Other types of federal student loans include direct unsubsidized loans and direct PLUS loans.Unsubsidized loans are an option for undergraduates as well as graduate students and professional students. These loans don't require financial need, but you're on the hook for the interest as soon as you take out a loan. Direct PLUS loans include loans for graduate students, as well as parent PLUS loans, which can be used to pay costs for a child enrolled in an undergraduate program.Federal loans carry fixed interest rates, which means the rate will remain the same throughout the repayment term. For undergraduate borrowers in the 2023-2024 school year, the interest rates for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans is 5.50%. For graduate/professional borrowers, it\u2019s 7.05%.For direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans \u2014 also sometimes called Stafford loans \u2014 there are borrowing limits based on your year in school and your status as an independent or dependent student under FAFSA. You can see a detailed breakdown by grade here, but speaking broadly, limits for undergraduates range from $5,500 to $12,500 in federal loans a year.It's worth noting that there is a one-time loan fee of 1.057% for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans.Direct PLUS loans involve a basic credit check, but denials are uncommon. PLUS loans carry higher interest rates \u2014 currently 8.05% \u2014 and a higher origination fee of 4.2%. The biggest PLUS loan you can get is the total cost of attendance minus your other financial aid.It\u2019s smart to explore your repayment options and likely monthly payment amounts before you borrow to make sure you\u2019ll be able to handle the loans once you leave school. There are several repayment options for federal loans; the government even has a loan simulator tool that helps you find your best repayment strategy based on your employment situation, location, salary, projected income growth, tax filing status and more. You can choose whether you'd prefer to pay your loan off fast, prioritize a smaller monthly payment and so on.For some students, federal loans will not be enough to cover the costs of their education. After you've exhausted your federal loan options, you may still have gaps to fill.Issued by companies like Sallie Mae, SoFi and Earnest, as well as credit unions, private loans have fewer protections than federal loans. They're contingent on your credit score, and they don't necessarily have borrowing limits \u2014 which can be dangerous for a student who borrows more than they can ultimately afford.As such, tread carefully. Many experts recommend students avoid private loans altogether, but if you are going to take them out, make sure to shop around and scrutinize each lender's terms, fees and perks before committing. Note that while students can take out federal student loans regardless of their parent\u2019s income or credit history, with private student loans, most undergraduate students are going to need a creditworthy cosigner to get approved for a private loan.Student loans aren't mandatory. Families sometimes tap a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay for college. Interest rates may be more favorable, but because your house is your collateral, this strategy can be risky. You're basically transferring the burden from one loan to another.Another way to manage college costs is to check with the financial aid office to see whether your school offers a tuition payment plan. These can allow families to make payments over a period of time as opposed to all at once up front.\nAds by Money.

Click below for more information.View Rates\nAfter you fill out the FAFSA, you don't need to submit a separate loan application to access federal loans. But there is other paperwork to complete with the U.S. Education Department. With federal student loans, you'll have to do some entrance counseling that runs you through the basics of borrowing money. It'll take about a half hour.You'll also need to sign a master promissory note in which you formally commit to paying back your loan plus any interest.If you're pursuing a private student loan, you'll probably need to pass a credit check. According to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, your lender is likely looking for you to have a score \"in the high 600s\" or above. The better your credit score, the better your loan terms and interest rates will be. If you have bad credit or no credit history (like most younger undergraduate students), you will need a cosigner. Like with other loans, a student loan cosigner agrees to share responsibility for the debt if the borrower doesn't pay it back.To prepare for a credit check or loan application and get an idea of where you stand, you may want to pull your credit report and review your credit history for any major errors. (You can get one free credit report every week on AnnualCreditReport.com until December 2023.)When it actually comes time to apply for a private student loan, you should have your (and your cosigner\u2019s) financial information on hand, including employment and income history, bank statements and tax documents.Don\u2019t procrastinate coming up with a plan to pay back your loan.It\u2019s critical to understand how much your first payment will be and when you\u2019ll owe it. Experts say for every $10,000 you borrow, you can expect to owe $125 a month for 10 years.With federal loans, one popular repayment route is income-based repayment, which ties your monthly student loan bills to your earnings. You could have no required monthly payment, or you could be asked to pay up to 20% of your discretionary income.After 20 or 25 years, depending on the income-based plan you qualify for, any outstanding student loan debt will be forgiven. But keep in mind that while these plans can reduce how much you pay monthly, they may actually increase how much you pay over the long term because your monthly amount due may not be enough to pay down your principal.If you're having trouble affording your student loan payments, the government allows borrowers to defer (or postpone) their payments or put loans into forbearance. In forbearance, interest always accrues; in deferment, interest will accrue on most loans, though there are some that are exempt.For this reason, the Education Department urges borrowers to learn their other repayment options before resorting to deferment and forbearance. In most cases, enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan to lower your monthly payment to a more affordable amount is preferable to either forbearance or deferment. (If you're already in one of these plans but are still struggling to afford your debt, you may be able to update your financial information to reduce your payment.)Private lenders often have forbearance options, too, but they are less generous than federal ones. Should you choose to refinance your loans, companies like Splash Financial or Credible can help you compare interest rates and (hopefully) save money. There\u2019s little downside to refinancing private student loans to get better repayment terms, but you should think very carefully before refinancing federal loans; refinancing means you give up access to all federal benefits and repayment options.Ultimately, you want to do everything you can to avoid missing payments. Not only does it start you down a path to delinquency, which can affect your credit score, but it can also push your loan into default. There's a long list of consequences for defaulting on your student loans \u2014 it can impact your eligibility for more aid, stop you from accessing deferments and prevent you from getting your transcript. The government can withhold money from your tax refunds. You might even end up in court.Before it gets to that point, you should reach out to your servicer, a financial advisor or a student loan counselor.\nAds by Money.

Parent PLUS loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Graduate students can use PLUS loans as well. \r\n                      \r\n                      The other type of loans are private student loans issued by banks and credit unions. Usually, experts say to exhaust federal student loan options before taking out private student loans.\r\n                      Can I get a student loan on my own? chevron-downchevron-upIt depends. For federal student loans, most students who are under 24 years old are considered dependent students, and the government requires you to submit information about your parents' income for financial aid calculations. That said, unsubsidized federal loans aren't based on parents' finances, so even though you have to submit their information, it will not affect your\u00a0 eligibility for that type of loan. You may be able to get a loan (and other federal aid) without involving a parent if you meet the criteria detailed here.\r\n                      \r\n                      With private student loans, lenders will often ask for cosigners if a student lacks a strong enough credit history. How much can I borrow with student loans?chevron-downchevron-upFor undergraduate federal student loans, the maximum for dependent students is $31,000. For independent students, the max is $57,500. In both cases, students can only borrow up to $23,000 in subsidized loans. More information about borrowing limits for federal student loans is available here. Borrowing limits for private student loans vary by lender. What do I need to qualify for a student loan? chevron-downchevron-upTo take out federal student loans, you must first be enrolled or accepted into a college or another qualifying program. You'll need to have a Social Security Number and either be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Other criteria include meeting academic progress standards and signing a section of the FAFSA that confirms you're not already in default on a federal student loan, among other things. You can read more about qualifying for federal student loans here. Subsidized student loans have additional qualifications because you need to demonstrate financial need.\u00a0\r\n                      \r\n                      For private loans, you (or a cosigner) will need to meet the individual lender's income and credit requirements.\r\n                      \nHow to Pay for CollegeBest Student Loans Guide to College Grants and Scholarships", "label": "Loans", "link": "https://money.com/get-a-student-loan/"}, {"title": "Guide to College Grants and Scholarships | Money", "date": "2023-06-26 00:00:00", "content": "College-bound students might think application season is done once they hit submit.

Grants and scholarships come from different agencies and institutions, including the federal government, state governments, colleges and private organizations.The big difference between the two is that grants tend to be need-based, while scholarships tend to be merit-based or interest-based. Merit-based awards are often tied to academic achievement; that means good grades, test scores or both. But scholarships can be awarded for other attributes, such as an underrepresented background, leadership, music, sports, community service, a specific major or geographic diversity. Sometimes scholarships include a need-based component and may require students to submit their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to show qualifying income. The main thing is to read the fine print on eligibility and start applying early.Scholarships come from a variety of places. Two of the largest sources are state scholarships \u2014 funded by state governments \u2014 and institutional scholarships from colleges.Many states offer scholarships as incentives for resident undergraduate students to stay in-state for college. The goal is to encourage eligible students to stick around after graduation to contribute to the state workforce, possibly in a high-need field like healthcare. A few examples are Florida\u2019s lottery-funded renewable Bright Futures Scholarship, Georgia\u2019s Hope and Zell Miller Scholarships, New York\u2019s Excelsior Scholarship, and Washington\u2019s Opportunity Scholarship for specific fields.Many state scholarships require demonstrated academic achievement in high school, such as a certain GPA, standardized test scores and specific coursework. Even if a scholarship is need-based, like the Excelsior program in New York, it may include stiff academic progress requirements while in college. Many state scholarships only work at public institutions (community colleges or universities), but some, like the Washington Opportunity Scholarship, can also be applied to private colleges.In your scholarship search, check out your state financial aid program and the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s higher education agency map. Most state scholarships require residency, but not all do.If you apply to the right college for your profile, you could be awarded a renewable scholarship for good grades, a sport or a special interest. Common scholarship types include:Not all colleges offer equally generous scholarships. For example, the highly elite colleges don\u2019t offer academic scholarships at all, only need-based financial aid. That\u2019s because everyone at these schools is a top student. So, if you\u2019re a valedictorian from a high-income family hoping for a merit scholarship, you won\u2019t receive one at Ivy League schools, for example. You\u2019d be better off looking for a college that is known to award large merit scholarships.This is why it's critical to take the time to understand the different types of financial aid individual colleges offer. (Many colleges explain their financial aid policies on their websites, but if you\u2019re confused about how a specific college hands out its financial aid budget, you can ask the financial aid office. Colorado College, for example, has a clear policy about meeting need rather than offering merit scholarships.)Community-based organizations, nonprofit foundations and other groups award scholarships for the same kinds of attributes that colleges do. These scholarship opportunities start as small as a couple hundred dollars and increase in value all the way up to awards that cover most of the cost of attendance. In general, the more money on the table, the more competitive the scholarship program. More on how to find these below.The three main types of grants come from the federal government, state governments and colleges. They\u2019re given to students with financial need.The most well-known grant is the federal Pell Grant, but the federal government also offers a few others for specific demographics.Many states offer one or several need-based grants for resident undergrads. Like state-funded scholarships, the goal is to encourage students to work in-state after graduation. Check state financial aid programs where you live or in the state where you're interested in attending college to learn the latest (not all require residency). A few examples of state grants include:Typically, grants from colleges are renewable if your income doesn\u2019t change much. That can add up to a significant amount of money. Remember those elite colleges? They can open affordable doors with need-based grants to qualifying students. Even middle-income families can qualify at these colleges. Stanford, for example, recently expanded its financial aid program so that most students from families earning up to $100,000 get tuition and room and board covered. And several schools, including Princeton and Rice universities give full tuition scholarships to families earning up to $140,000 or $150,000.Organizations and foundations offer grants for study abroad, particular fields of study, underrepresented students, and non-traditional students such as a mother returning to college. Note that many of these aren\u2019t designed for bachelor\u2019s degree programs, and instead are specific to graduate-level studies.\nAds by Money.

Federal financial aid is a good beginning, but for most people, it\u2019s not a major way to pay for college.State grants also require the FAFSA and possibly a supplemental state form accessible through the FAFSA or your state\u2019s education website \u2014 check your state\u2019s requirements. For example, New York offers the TAP grant via the FAFSA or the state Dream Act form if you\u2019re not FAFSA-eligible.Institutional scholarships and grants are trickier to find because they depend on you applying to colleges that offer money for your academic, financial or extracurricular profile. That takes research. Start by running the net price calculators on college websites. You can also check out these tools to find best-fit colleges.For private scholarships and grants, search locally first to minimize the competition (national scholarships draw thousands of applicants). Some scholarships require the FAFSA; many don\u2019t. For private grants, check out this list of resources, especially if you\u2019re a graduate student.Grants tend to simply require college financial aid forms \u2014 the FAFSA and maybe the CSS Profile \u2014 while scholarships run the gamut on requirements.Some colleges offer automatic scholarships for certain grades and test scores, and they don\u2019t need an extra application. Other college scholarships \u2014 and private scholarships \u2014 will require their own application. Possible requirements include:This fall, the FAFSA doesn\u2019t open until December (a one-time opening date to accommodate the new design and then the schedule will return to Oct. 1 in 2024). Some colleges also use the CSS Profile for awarding institutional grants, and that opens Oct. 1. States also have individual FAFSA deadlines, so check yours. This year, colleges and states will flex their deadlines to account for the later FAFSA opening.Some colleges offer scholarships with early deadlines \u2014 ask admissions offices about those so you don\u2019t miss them. Private scholarship deadlines vary widely with many having spring deadlines.It may sound clich\u00e9, but it is both never too early nor too late look for scholarships to apply to.Staying organized isn\u2019t easy, but it will help you manage the application process with a lot less stress. Track scholarship deadlines and completed submissions in some kind of spreadsheet. Here are some additional tips on how to stand out:Sometimes you come up empty-handed or don\u2019t receive enough money. Maybe your family doesn\u2019t qualify for financial aid at the colleges you applied to, or the scholarships you're awarded are small. What else can you do to pay for college?Work-study is an approved on-campus or off-campus job funded partly by federal or state work-study funds. Work-study is a need-based award, typically ranging from $2,000 to $5,000. Fill out the FAFSA to find out if you qualify. Once you receive work-study funds, you need to apply for a work-study job just like you apply for any job. Work-study jobs tend to be flexible, fitting in around your classes.Even if you\u2019re not awarded work-study, you can look for a non-work study job on-campus or off-campus to earn money for college.As a last resort, after exhausting all other free money, there are student loans. They come in two types: federal loans and private loans. The low-interest federal direct student loans come with annual limits, which are different for dependent and independent students.Then there are private student loans. You should always borrow federal loans first, because private loans don\u2019t offer the protections that federal student loans do, like income-driven repayment plans. Still, private loans may be necessary to cover funding gaps. Private loans can offer a lower interest rate for a good credit score.The Best Colleges in America, Rated by ValueParent PLUS Loans: A Guide to Helping Your Student Pay for College4 Myths About College Scholarships That Could Cost You", "label": "FamilyFinance", "link": "https://money.com/scholarships-grants-for-college/"}, {"title": "Parent PLUS Loans: A Guide to Helping Pay for College | Money", "date": "2023-06-13 00:00:00", "content": "A large portion of college students take out their own loans, turning to federal student loans and private loans, personal loans or even using credit cards to help pay for college. However, there are also many parents who want to pitch in \u2013 either to help their kids cover high educational expenses or because those young adults are unable to qualify for enough funding on their own.About 18% of parents borrowed money last year on their children\u2019s behalf to help pay for college, according to a recent survey by Sallie Mae.

These loans can be used to pay for tuition and other qualifying educational expenses, such as room and board, books, supplies and fees.With a Parent PLUS loan, the parent is the borrower, rather than the student. This means that the parent is responsible for qualifying for the loan and repaying the loan once any deferment period ends.The maximum borrowing limit on a Parent PLUS loan is the actual cost of attendance (including tuition, room and board, fees, books and miscellaneous costs) as determined by the school, minus any other financial aid sources offered to the student (such as scholarships or grants). This means that you can borrow as much as you need to pay for college and all related educational expenses, as long as the parent borrower qualifies and doesn\u2019t have an adverse credit history. (More on that below)As with other federal student loans, Parent PLUS loans are disbursed directly to the school. If any funds remain after applicable tuition and educational expenses are paid, they will be issued back to the parent or, in select cases, to the student.Parent PLUS loans are issued with a fixed interest rate that remains the same for the duration of the loan repayment period. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the Parent PLUS interest rate is 8.05%.There is also an origination fee applied to Parent PLUS loans, which impacts the overall cost of the loan. This fixed, one-time fee is deducted from the initial disbursement of the funds; as of this writing, the fee on a Parent PLUS loan is 4.228%.With a Parent PLUS loan, loan repayment begins after funds are disbursed, unless the borrower requests to defer repayment until the student has graduated or withdrawn from school. In the case of a deferment, parent borrowers will have a six month grace period after the student graduates (or otherwise drops below half-time enrollment) before payments are due.Note that Parent PLUS loans are unsubsidized loans. This means that even with an approved loan deferment, interest will begin to accrue on the balance right away, regardless of the repayment term or deferment plan chosen.Parent PLUS loans may still be eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), if certain requirements are met after the student graduates. Parent borrowers can also consolidate their student debt with a Direct Consolidation Loan and even take advantage of the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan. This process combines all of your loan balances into one account with one interest rate (based on the average of each loan\u2019s rate), so it\u2019s a bit different than refinancing.When it comes to paying for college, the majority of parents help cover tuition and expenses for their student children. According to Sallie Mae, 75% of students will use a parent\u2019s current income, existing savings or a college savings plan to pay for at least some of their education, in addition to their own income and any available financial aid.If that isn\u2019t enough, though, parents and students may find themselves borrowing funds elsewhere. And a Parent PLUS loan isn\u2019t the only option.There are many for-profit banks and lenders that offer private student loans to borrowers and their parents. Because these loans aren\u2019t offered by the federal government, you can expect them to operate a bit differently.Loan terms vary by private lender. They may have fixed or variable interest rates, which may be higher than the rates offered on federal loans. They typically don\u2019t have an origination fee. The borrower (student or parent) will need to qualify based on income, credit score, and other personal factors; it may be more difficult to get approved for a private parent loan to pay for college than a federal one. On the other hand, if you have a high credit score, you may be able to qualify for a private loan with lower interest rates than PLUS loans. (Note that it\u2019s very hard for students to take a private loan on their own. Typically they need a cosigner with a longer credit history.)Private loans also don\u2019t offer the same protections as federal student loans, such as loan deferment and forbearance or income-driven repayment plans. However, the overall maximum loan amount may be higher with private loans, giving you the flexibility to cover a range of expenses while in school. This is because federal student loans may offer up to the total cost of attendance minus any existing aid. Private student loans, however, may allow you to still borrow up to the total cost of attendance, regardless of the aid offered.Parents with equity in their homes can also borrow against that value with a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit, also known as a HELOC.Both products work similarly: they allow you to borrow against a portion of your home\u2019s value, securing that debt with the equity you own. Because this debt is secured, it can sometimes be easier to get approved and may even come with a lower interest rate than an unsecured private loan.With that said, home equity loans and HELOCs are riskier for the borrower than student loans, as they are secured by your home. If you default on repayment, the lender could force a foreclosure on your home to recoup the debt.\nAds by Money.

This form should be filled out prior to the start of the current school year.You should sit down to figure out how much you need to borrow, and what monthly payments you can realistically afford. Consider all available funds that can go toward tuition and other school expenses: college savings, parent and student income, scholarships, grants, work study programs and more. This will give you a clear idea of how much you need to borrow.Once you know how much money you need, you can apply for a Parent PLUS loan. This can be done online through the Direct PLUS loan application site. A credit check will be run to determine eligibility, and the school will be contacted to verify enrollment and the cost of attendance.Parent borrowers with adverse credit histories may find it difficult to get approved for a PLUS loan, or may need to meet certain other requirements in order to qualify. Per the Department of Education, an adverse credit history includes one or more debts (totaling at least $2,085), which are either 90 days or more delinquent, have been placed in collections within the last two years, or were charged off in the last two years. It also includes things like a foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage garnishment, loan default or bankruptcy within the last five years.After approval, you will be asked to sign a PLUS Loan Master Promissory Note (aka a Direct PLUS Loan MPN) before any funds will be disbursed. This note is essentially your agreement to repay the borrowed funds according to the terms offered.Federal student borrowers can enjoy perks such as loan forgiveness programs and income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. But are parent borrowers eligible for the same benefits?Yes, some of these programs and benefits are available to parents, too. For instance, Parent PLUS borrowers can still choose between four different repayment plans:The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plan is only available to parents who consolidate their Parent PLUS loans using a Direct Consolidation loan. This income-driven repayment plan is also a necessary step toward qualifying for loan forgiveness, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.Even if you don\u2019t work in a non-profit or government job that\u2019s needed to qualify for PSLF, the ICR plan has a maximum repayment term of 25 years. After that time, any remaining loan balance is forgiven.\nAds by Money. We may be compensated if you click this ad.AdNeed some financial aid to cover tuition?

Experts Offer Some Hard Truths", "label": "FamilyFinance", "link": "https://money.com/parent-plus-loans-guide/"}, {"title": "How to Pay for College | Money", "date": "2023-07-17 00:00:00", "content": "Going to college has a ton of benefits \u2014 it's fun, educational and can lead to a roughly $30,000 annual earnings premium for people who graduate with bachelor's degrees, government data shows. But it is also undeniably expensive.Experts say it\u2019s never too early to start thinking about college \u2014 where you want to attend, what you want to study and, of course, how you\u2019re going to pay for it.These questions often trouble people in their junior or senior years of high school, but experts say you can alleviate some of the dread by thinking about them sooner rather than later.No matter where you and your family are in your higher education journey, it's smart to make a financial plan that combines your savings and current income with student loans and \"free money\" from grants and scholarships.Don\u2019t know where to start? Our guide covers 11 strategies to help you pay for college.Table of contents:If you\u2019re a parent, relative or friend, you can set up savings accounts for a child\u2019s higher education expenses. The earlier you start with these, the better. Here are some of the most common options for college savings plans to consider.The most popular option is a 529 plan, formally referred to as a qualified tuition plan. Not only do many 529s come with state tax benefits, but withdrawals are also tax-free if used for certain education expenses. Qualified expenses include college tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment (like laptops).These plans are typically sponsored by states, though you can open accounts in states you don't live in.They come in two varieties. Prepaid tuition plans allow you to purchase future tuition at today's rates. College savings plans are investment accounts that grow over time.\nAds by Money.

Click below to sign up now.Start Saving Today\nAnother way to prepare for college costs is through a Coverdell education savings account, which is a trust or custodial account intended to cover certain school-related expenses for people under age 18. Coverdell savings grow tax-free, like 529s, and can be used for college as well as elementary and secondary education.But contributions are not tax-deductible and are capped at $2,000 a year for each beneficiary, depending on your family\u2019s income. The money generally has to be spent by the time the beneficiary is 30 years old.Alternatives include accounts under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (abbreviated UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA). These are considered more flexible options than a 529 or Coverdell because the funds can be used for anything \u2014 not only education expenses. Adults hold assets for a minor until they reach a certain age, at which point the account is transferred to them.Each type of account offers its own pros and cons, but in most cases, experts recommend 529 accounts over the other types for education savings. They offer possible state tax advantages as well as federal tax advantages, have higher contribution limits than Coverdell accounts and are counted more favorably under financial aid formulas than UGMAs.The U.S. government may be willing to help you pay your college bills by providing federal financial aid. Undergraduate students need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to receive a federal financial aid award, so be sure to do that as soon as possible.The FAFSA typically opens on Oct. 1 each year. (Things are different for the 2024-2025 FAFSA, though, which won\u2019t launch until December.)You technically have a while to fill it out. For the 2022-2023 school year, the federal deadline is June 30, 2023; for the 2023-2024 school year, it\u2019s June 30, 2024. But you shouldn't drag your feet \u2014 some institutions and states have different deadlines and may award aid on a first-come, first-served basis.To fill out the FAFSA, you'll need to gather your Social Security or Alien Registration Number, tax records, bank statements, investment records and documentation of untaxed income. You'll also need to create a Federal Student Aid account or FSA ID. Visit FAFSA.gov to get started.Experts recommend that you fill out the FAFSA \u2014 even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll qualify for need-based aid \u2014 because many institutions also use the data from the FAFSA to make decisions about their own aid.After you file your FAFSA, you\u2019ll first get a Student Aid Report, which is an estimate of how much federal aid you may receive. Later on, after you\u2019ve been accepted to a college, you'll receive an award letter that lays out grants and loans from the federal government, state and specific college you're looking at.Grants and scholarships are different from loans because you don\u2019t need to pay them back, meaning there\u2019s no need to worry about student loan payments. That\u2019s why you will often hear these types of financial aid called \u201cfree money.\u201dThe U.S. Department of Education runs the Pell Grant program, which gives money to students from low-income families. The specific amount you'll receive depends on your expected family contribution and your cost of attendance. For the 2022-2023 year, the maximum is $6,895. That maximum Pell Grant will be bumped to $7,395 for the 2023-2024 year.In addition to this federal assistance, each state provides additional financial aid.Florida, for example, has the Bright Futures Scholarship Program. Washington has the Washington College Grant, which \u2014 depending on your family\u2019s income \u2014 may cover full tuition costs at approved schools or career training programs.Schools also often offer what's called merit aid to students with certain standardized test scores or other academic achievements. At private colleges especially, this is a significant form of financial aid, totaling billions of dollars a year.Finally, you may want to take advantage of outside scholarships. Companies, nonprofits, foundations and other groups are constantly coming out with private scholarship opportunities that may offer free money with fewer strings attached than federal, state or institutional programs.The biggest challenge is finding them. Check with your high school guidance counselor to see if they know of any local scholarships you should pursue. From there, use a scholarship search engine like Niche or Fastweb to identify other grants you might be eligible for. They may require some elbow grease. But writing an essay or filming a creative video, for example, is arguably easier than paying for college out of pocket.Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of common sources of funding:It could make sense for you to pull money from a traditional savings account to cover the costs of college. This strategy may drain some of your savings, but it could help you avoid having to take out loans for your college expenses.Student loans typically have interest that may begin accruing while you\u2019re in school. If you can avoid paying interest by using cash from your savings to pay your bills up front, then it will decrease your total costs in the long run.Working during school is another way some students pay for college. Consider participating in the federal work-study (FWS) program, which gives part-time jobs to students in financial need. Work-study jobs pay at least the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25 per hour) but can pay more.Experts recommend you always answer \"yes\" when asked about your interest in work-study on the FAFSA. You don't have to take a work-study job that's ultimately offered to you in your financial aid letter, so by answering yes, you're simply keeping your options open.One thing to keep in mind: Not everyone is guaranteed a work-study job, and you'll only be approved for a limited amount of wages. Your school\u2019s financial aid office ultimately determines this based on the funding they received from the government and your FAFSA.You can also look for other options for work while in school. For example, you could land a student research position in your subject area to gain academic experience while earning income. Or you could look at job listings to see which employers are hiring in your area.After you've exhausted all of the options above, you may want to move on to private student loans. This will require some shopping around.When taking out private student loans, be careful, and do your research. In addition to having higher interest rates and fewer repayment options, private loans often involve credit checks and application fees. The income requirements for loan approval can also vary.Additionally, private student loans aren\u2019t eligible to receive the same benefits as federal loans.If you can\u2019t find a financial strategy that enables you to pay for your top-choice college, it may be time to look into alternative options. Not all colleges are created equal, especially when it comes to cost. For example, in-state fees for public institutions \u2014 which receive government funding \u2014 tend to be cheaper than fees for private schools \u2014 which rely on their students for revenue.For the 2022-2023 academic year, the College Board reports that the average published tuition and fees in the U.S. were $10,950 for in-state public schools and $28,240 for out-of-state public schools. Private non-profit schools cost $39,400 on average. (All of those figures are for four-year institutions.)Private, for-profit figures were not included, but those institutions typically charge even more. As you can see, different types of colleges come with drastically different price tags. The price will also vary considerably by state.In Wyoming, for example, in-state tuition and fees at public four-year colleges cost an average of $6,440 per year; in Vermont, they cost $17,650 per year, College Board data from the same year shows.There's also a difference between the listed price and what a student actually pays. A college's so-called \"sticker price\" is often a scary-large number that doesn't include financial aid. (Private colleges in particular end up discounting tuition, often by at least half, research shows.)In order to figure out what you\u2019ll actually pay, you'll want to look for a college's \"net price,\" which you can find with the help of institution-specific calculators or general tools like MyinTuition.org. It's better to use tools to get a personalized net price, rather than just looking at an average net price.And remember that you're not only on the hook for tuition and fees. The full cost of college also includes room, board, textbooks, transportation, health care... the list goes on.In rare cases, it could be more affordable to study abroad instead of going to a college in the U.S. It\u2019s no secret that universities are often more affordable elsewhere in the world. You may be able to find one that accepts American students at a significantly reduced tuition rate compared to what you would pay stateside.For example, Germany is known for offering a tuition-free public university education to international students. You just have to be accepted to study at a university and prove that you can cover your living expenses to be approved for a student visa.Studying abroad can be an incredibly enriching experience that helps you improve your language skills and broaden your horizons. However, you may need to speak a foreign language at a near-native level in order to qualify for admission to foreign universities, and some schools charge a higher average cost to international students. (Note that only some international schools participate in federal student loan programs. None participate in U.S. Education Department grant programs, so you won\u2019t be able to use a Pell Grant.)Plus, there are travel and moving costs to consider.Community college can be a cost-effective alternative to a traditional four-year university because its tuition costs are often significantly lower.Students can complete their first two years of schooling at a community college and then apply to transfer to a four-year university. This reduces the tuition costs for the first two years of your college degree. Your bachelor\u2019s degree will look the same regardless of whether you complete all four years at a traditional college or start at a community college.Community college can also be a way to bounce back from subpar academic performance in high school. If you have a strong GPA from your community college, it may help you qualify for admission to more selective universities when you\u2019re ready to transfer.In some circumstances, it may make sense to take a year off from college to save money. For example, if you\u2019re uninterested in community college but can\u2019t afford the cost of a four-year school yet, you could work and save for a year until you have enough funds.Some schools will grant you a deferral, which allows you to pause your studies for a year and retain your acceptance. Taking a gap year may also give you the chance to pursue passions, gain work experience or develop a better understanding of the type of work you would like to do when you eventually graduate from college.There are also high school programs that allow younger students to earn college credits before graduating. These programs can reduce the cost of college by decreasing the number of credits you need to take (and pay for) in order to earn your degree.Advanced Placement (AP) courses and College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests are two common ways to \u201ctest out\u201d of college classes. If you did well on your high school AP exams, you may be able to send your scores to a college to be counted as credit toward your degree. Most colleges will grant credit for popular AP courses, according to the College Board, but rules vary by college and academic department.About 2,900 colleges accept CLEP test scores, too, the College Board says. You must register to take these standardized tests, and depending on your scores, they may satisfy your college\u2019s general education requirements.CLEP is not as popular as the AP program, so be sure to check that your college accepts CLEP scores before you sign up to take an exam.Dual enrollment is another popular way to potentially reduce college costs \u2014 and help you graduate faster.Also known as concurrent enrollment or early college, these programs allow you to take college classes, usually at a nearby community college, while you\u2019re still in high school. Doing so allows you to earn high school credit and college credit at the same time.By the time you graduate high school, you\u2019ll have already knocked out some of your general education requirements for college.Every state except New York and Pennsylvania has statewide dual enrollment programs. Even so, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t dual-enroll in those two states. You still can, but the program will likely be run by specific colleges.Dual enrollment is often a cheaper alternative per credit hour than directly enrolling in a college after you graduate high school, and in many cases, it can be free. The price depends on many factors, though, and could be set by your state, your school district, or the college you\u2019re dually enrolled in.\nAds by Money.

Click below for more information.View Rates\nIf you\u2019re interested in lowering your tuition and associated enrollment expenses, applying your student\u2019s extra cash to these costs will only get you so far. Here are a few additional strategies.A good first step is to compare tuition and enrollment expenses across multiple colleges. Some will be much more affordable than others, which could impact where you choose to attend.It\u2019s also important to note that colleges may have different payment plans available. For example, one school may require a full tuition payment up front at the start of the academic year.; another may give you 12 months to pay off your tuition. This could be a meaningful distinction depending on how you pay for college.You may also be able to save money at your top choice school by living off campus instead of in student housing. Student housing may come with extra payments and charges for things like meal plans that you don\u2019t necessarily need to pay.Some students may be able to reduce their living expenses by renting a room near campus and buying their own groceries. However, living off campus won\u2019t always save you money, so it\u2019s important to compare your expected costs to the price of student housing before making a decision.If you can\u2019t bring your college expenses down any further, the next step is figuring out how to save or earn additional money to cover your mandatory costs. Here are a few tips for paying for college with this strategy.You can begin by increasing your savings. That means starting as early as possible and choosing a type of savings account that matches your financial goals and offers a high APY (annual percentage yield).If you want to save more money to pay for college, you can either reduce your expenses \u2014 by cutting back on things like eating out or travel \u2014 or bring in more money.Working while pursuing a college education may be what it takes for you to afford your top-choice college. However, that can be difficult to do while balancing your class schedule, extracurricular activities and social life.One option is to look for employment that allows you to work on your own schedule. You could be a food app delivery driver or find an online job that lets you set your own hours. Another option is to take advantage of online classes. These can be more flexible than in-person lectures because you are typically free to study at the hours that work for you instead of having to be physically present in class at a certain time.There may be ways to maximize your current income, as well. For example, if you\u2019re trying to save for a child\u2019s college expenses, you could negotiate a raise or ask for more responsibilities that might warrant a higher paycheck.There\u2019s also always the option of supplementing the work you do now with a second job. This is easier to do than ever, thanks to the abundance of online work-from-home opportunities, including finding freelancing jobs in your area of expertise and virtual positions.If you need to work a full-time job while taking classes, scheduling and time management will be very important. Be sure to set aside significant time to study and try to find a job that allows some flexibility. Flex time can be particularly helpful, as can work-from-home jobs that you can do on or close to campus. To qualify for federal student loans you must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (with some exceptions) and have financial need. The amount you get approved for will depend on your income, with higher earners qualifying for reduced aid. If you wish to be approved for Direct PLUS Parent loans, you can't have an adverse credit history. This means not having recent collections or significant past-due balances.There are plenty of ways to pay for college. We cover 11 strategies above \u2014 including grants, scholarships, jobs and loans as well as several ways to reduce the cost of college to make it more affordable in the first place \u2014 but these methods might not all be applicable to your situation. The most important thing is to carve out some time to make a financial plan that works for you and your family.\nSHOWHIDEAds by Money.
