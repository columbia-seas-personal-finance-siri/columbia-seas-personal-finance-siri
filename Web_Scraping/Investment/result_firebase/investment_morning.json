","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1094567\/do-529-plans-have-contribution-limits","Article Content":"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. 529 education savings plans are popular choices for investing for college. Here with me to discuss some of the contribution limits and tax considerations when investing in 529 plans is Patty Oey. She's a senior analyst with Morningstar's research team.Hi, Patty, nice to see you today.Patricia Oey: Hi, Susan, nice to see you, too. Dziubinski: So, let's start out with the elevator pitch for 529 education savings plans: What are they?Oey: Sure. These plans, what they have is they have a menu of investment options. Usually the default option is something that derisks over time. So if you invest when your child is young, the portfolio will be heavy in equities, and they'll trim the equities down as the time passes, so that when you get ready to spend the money, the equity allocation is lower so you don't see the portfolio value move so much just before you're about to spend it. Plans will also offer a menu of mutual funds and ETFs that you can also invest in, and then finally there is a place to park your cash. So it'll be like a stable value or an FDIC-insured account.Dziubinski: Now, who can invest in a 529 plan and for whom? Oey: Sure. Technically, anyone can open a 529 plan and name a beneficiary. Typically, it's the parents who open a 529 plan for their child, but certainly grandparents can do it. And then someone like me, I have six nieces and nephews\u2014I can open one for each of them as well. And then family friends. So really, anyone can open one as long as there is a beneficiary who's planning to go to school.Dziubinski: Now, can beneficiaries only have one 529 education plan?Oey: No. Again, going back, so I have two kids, so I can open one for each kid and then say, you know, they have their grandparents, two sets of grandparents, so each grandparent can open an account for that one son. Yes, one person can have more than one account. Dziubinski: Now, let's talk a little bit about annual contributions. Are there annual contribution limits when it comes to these plans? For instance, how much can one person invest in someone's 529 plan?Oey: Technically, there is no contribution limits, but putting money into a 529 account, it's considered a gift. So, it is technically subject to the gift tax exclusion. In 2022, that is $16,000. If you do go over, then it gets counted against your lifetime exclusion. That is $12 million. I guess technically, if you know later on that your estate is not going to be close to $12 million, there is no tax penalty for contributing more, but it is technically under the $16,000 limit per beneficiary, per donor. So I can give to my kid $16,000. My husband can also give to that same kid $16,000.Dziubinski: Got it. Now, of course, as you pointed out, more than one person can contribute to a beneficiary's 529 education savings plan. Are there limits in total to how much money can be in a given beneficiary's 529 plan?Oey: Say I have my son, and I have a plan for my son and my parents have a plan for him. The limit is per plan. And then generally, these plans are offered by different states, the states set the limit on how big the accounts can be. Roughly the maximum is equivalent to about a four-year education, tuition plus room and board. On the low end, some states, their maximum is closer to $300,000. On the higher end, it's probably like around $500,000 or more. It just depends on the state. But again, it's per account. For my account, say in our state, it's $500,000, I can max it out to $500,000. And then the plan that my parents open for my child, they can also max it out at $500,000, which is, you know, plenty of money.Dziubinski: Patty, is there a way that an account can be accidentally overfunded? Let's say there is that $500,000 limit in a given account? What prevents it from going over that amount? And if it does go over that amount, what happens?Oey: Yeah, good question. The plans, they have their cap. And so basically, if you hit that threshold, it will not accept more contributions. But certainly the market moves. So if the market continues to move up, they're not going to suddenly just shut down your account. They'll let the market ride and let that account ride. But yes, they will not accept any more contributions once you've hit the threshold.Dziubinski: Got it. And then just to wrap up, are there any other 529 plan contribution limits, tax considerations, anything that investors should be aware of if they're considering either opening a 529 plan or if they already have one that they're contributing to?Oey: Right. The key thing is that you put the money in the account, it grows, and if you spend the money on qualified expenses, you don't pay capital gains on the ... capital gains that you enjoyed in that account. So everyone is eligible for that benefit. At the state level, different states have their own rules regarding state tax benefits. Some states don't offer any tax benefits. Some states don't have state income taxes, so there's no benefit to offer. And then a whole bunch of other states offer different types of state tax benefit. And what that mainly is, is that you can deduct your contribution when you calculate your state income tax liability.Dziubinski: So before you make a decision, make sure you look at what state benefits you might be able to get from a tax perspective.Oey: Yes.Dziubinski: Sounds good. Well, Patty, thank you so much for walking us through some of these details with 529 plans. Again, they're very popular, are great ideas for saving for college and other educational expenses. But you've got to know the rules of the road. So, thank you.Oey: Thank you.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Thanks for tuning in.","Article Author":"Patricia Oey,  Susan Dziubinski","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"May 20, 2022"},"1":{"Article Title":" 5 Charts Tracking Recent 529 Savings Plan Trends    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1095648\/5-charts-tracking-recent-529-savings-plan-trends","Article Content":"The impetus for introducing 529 college savings plans over 20 years ago remains strong: to broaden accessibility to higher education through tax-advantaged investing. Since Morningstar assigned its first forward-looking Analyst Ratings to 529s in 2012, we've witnessed continuous improvements to these tax-advantaged investing plans, from the quality of the investment options to fee reductions.Assets in 529 plans increased by 17% in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $461 billion by year-end. Since 2011, assets have grown at a fairly steady clip, averaging about 13% a year (see Exhibit 1). Over that same period, growth in direct-sold plans, which tend to carry lower fees, averaged about 15% a year, versus 13% growth in the more expensive advisor-sold plans. Vanguard continues to maintain its lead within 529 plan investment options, holding an approximately 30% market share, followed by Capital Group at 20%. Far behind, but still material players include Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, T. Rowe Price, and Columbia Management, with market shares between 4% and 9%.     Glide Paths: An EvolutionThe 529 college savings plan was designed to be low maintenance and suitable for both novice and experienced investors. Each plan offers a menu of investment options, including aged-based or target-enrollment series, as well as individual mutual funds, and cash or cashlike accounts. The majority of 529 accountholders opt for the age-based or target-enrollment series because of their ease of use. When the beneficiary is young, the portfolio starts with a large allocation in equities, and then shifts to a more conservative positioning by trimming equities and moving into bonds and cash as the beneficiary approaches college age.In recent years, many plan providers have improved their series by adopting a smoother glide path. Some have switched to a progressive glide path, which makes small (around 2%) asset-allocation changes, typically four times a year. Others have added portfolios to their age-based series so that the equity step-downs (which take place in one day) are 12.5% or less. Larger equity steps of 20% or more expose investors to market-timing risk. These large shifts can weigh on returns if they were to take place as markets recover after a large decline. In 2016, over 40% of age-based series had at least one equity step of 21% or greater. By the end of March 2022, series with such large step-downs only accounted for 3% of the industry.     In 2020, a large group of plans moved to a progressive glide path. This included six managed by TIAA-CREF, such as the Gold-rated Michigan Education Savings Program and California's Silver-rated ScholarShare College Savings Plan. Another notable switch to progressive took place in Silver-rated The Vanguard 529 College Savings Plan, which did not go smoothly, as both state sponsor Nevada and Vanguard failed to notice errors in the asset allocation. The pace of change slowed in 2021, when only four plans moved from a stepped glide path to a progressive one: the Silver-rated Pennsylvania 529 Investment Plan, Utah's Gold-rated my529, Connecticut's Neutral-rated CHET Advisor 529 College Savings Plan, and Colorado's Neutral-rated Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan.In April 2021, Pennsylvania switched from offering three age-based series (conservative, moderate, and aggressive) to one target-enrollment option and kept the same underlying fund lineup. Utah's my529 made the change in July 2021, going from four age-based series to one target-enrollment option while also trimming the number of underlying funds. For both plans, the end of the glide path courts a little more risk than their prior conservative and moderate tracks. More specifically, the new progressive glide paths generally hold slightly higher equity allocations relative to the two plans' previous moderate options, and include an almost 20% equity allocation in the year prior to the target-enrollment year, whereas the prior conservative options had already moved to a zero allocation in equities. 529 investors who want to minimize downside risk just prior to enrollment should consider moving their assets into a cash or cashlike account.The remaining two plans that moved to a progressive glide path, Connecticut's CHET Advisor 529 College Savings Plan and Colorado's Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan, resulted from a change in program manager to Fidelity Investments and TIAA-CREF, respectively. Both firms employ progressive glide paths in the plans they manage for other states. Industry laggards, with steps of 21% or greater, include the Neutral-rated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan and three nonrated plans: Iowa's IAdvisor 529 Plan, Louisiana's START Saving Program, and Oregon's MFS 529 Savings Plan. Exhibit 3 shows the average equity allocations of 164 age-based or target-enrollment series, divided into five groups. The first group, progressive, includes 53 series. In this group, each plan typically follows one glide path but may provide choice. For example, plans managed by Fidelity, such as Massachusetts' Bronze-rated U.Fund College Investing Plan, employ one progressive glide path but provide a choice of three series: one that uses all active underlying funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a blend of active and index funds.The remaining four groups follow an age-based stepped glide path. There are 26 plans that offer one glide path option, depicted as \"age-based: one option.\" The remaining plans allow investors to pick their preferred risk profile by providing aggressive, moderate, and conservative options.     Plans that offer one glide path option (progressive and one option) have average equity allocations that are slightly higher than the average moderate glide path. While a higher equity allocation earlier in the glide path can potentially result in higher upside in the long run, investors will likely experience more volatility. That said, in 2020, during and immediately after the pandemic-related market slide, 529 investors appeared to stay put, suggesting that investors can weather volatility without panicking. But a large decline in 529 assets for those just about to enter college can be a stressful time for families. The average portfolio for an 18-year-old in a series with a progressive glide path has 15% in equities and at least 30% in bonds that carry duration and\/or credit risk. In the first four months of 2022, these portfolios saw average declines of 6% to 7% as both equities and bonds sank. More research into spending patterns during a beneficiary's college years may help determine if more conservative options at the end of the glide path may be beneficial for families.Fees Continue to FallAverage fees continue to fall across the investment industry, including 529 savings plans. At the end of 2021, the average fee for an age-based or target-enrollment series was 0.48%, a decline from 0.50% in the year prior. Direct-sold options continue to boast a substantial fee advantage, with average fees of 0.34%, reflecting a decline of 1 basis point from 2020. Meanwhile, advisor-sold plans remain significantly more expensive, with average fees of 0.84%, a decline of 5 basis points from the year prior.     Since their inception, 529 portfolios have often charged higher fees than comparable mutual funds and target-date series owing to additional layers of fees: one for the program manager of the investments and one for the state offering the plan. Over the years, some plans have reduced fees by trimming the state fees and negotiating with their program manager for lower fees. Plans with a growing and relatively larger asset base can achieve some economies of scale, which can be passed on to investors through lower fees. In 2021, Georgia's Silver-rated Path2College 529 Plan earned the distinction of offering the cheapest target-enrollment series, with average fees of 0.09%, a significant decline from its prior fees of 0.22%. This is notable as fee cuts tend to be much smaller. That year, the Georgia Higher Education Savings Board decided to waive its state administrative fee of 0.06% and also successfully negotiated lower program manager fees with TIAA-CREF during the contract renewal process. Other notable fee cuts came from Illinois. For its Neutral-rated Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 age-based series, the state shifted to lower cost-managers in certain asset classes, resulting in average fee declines of 9 to 12 basis points across its aggressive, moderate, and conservative series. For Illinois' Gold-rated Bright Start Direct-Sold College Savings, the blend series saw an average decline of 3 basis points, partly owing to a partial shift from active to passive for international-equity exposure. Last year, fee cuts also resulted from a change in program manager. Colorado's Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan selected TIAA-CREF to take over its advisor-sold plan, which now charges average fees of 0.77% for its target-enrollment series, a 16-basis-point decline from the year prior.     Advisor-sold plans remain more expensive than direct-sold plans, and Exhibit 5 provides a partial explanation, as it shows that on average, advisor-sold plans hold a higher percentage of actively managed strategies in their age-based or target-enrollment series. The most expensive offering in the 529 industry is Alaska's John Hancock Freedom 529, whose all-active age-based series charges an average fee of 1.21%. While the series was designed by the topnotch multi-asset team at T. Rowe Price, the exorbitant fees limit its Morningstar Analyst Rating to Neutral. The least expensive advisor-sold option with an all-active underlying lineup is Bronze-rated CollegeAmerica, which is sponsored by Virginia. The plan charges average fees of 0.77% for its target-enrollment series.Another reason for advisor-sold plans' higher fees is the annual distribution (or sales) fees paid to the advisor. Arizona, Maine, and North Dakota each offer an advisor-sold age-based or target-enrollment series that only holds low-cost index funds. The weighted average fees for the underlying index funds range from 0.04% to 0.15%, but after the addition of the management, state, and sales fees, the total expense ratios for these series rise to an expensive range of 0.59% to 0.79%.Morningstar doesn't prefer active or passive funds for age-based or target-enrollment series, but our research has consistently shown that over time, lower-fee options provide a reliable edge relative to peers. Lower fees present lower performance hurdles, putting less pressure on portfolio managers to take more risk to make up their funds' costs. It's hard even for outstanding asset allocation and talented managers to consistently overcome high costs, especially when their styles are out of favor. Low fees, however, are a dependable advantage that compounds over time and lead to better investor outcomes.This is the fifth and final article in this year's Morningstar series on 529 savings plans.

Yet, despite that popularity, misunderstandings abound about them. Joining me today to provide some clarity on several 529 plan myths is Patty Oey. Patty is a senior analyst with Morningstar's manager research group.Hi, Patty, nice to see you.Patricia Oey: Good to see you, too. Dziubinski: One myth about 529 plans is that they can only be used to cover college tuition. But that's really only part of the story. What else can 529 assets be used to pay for?Oey: Yeah, so you're right. Definitely tuition and fees. It actually can also cover room and board. And should you decide to live off-campus, you can use 529 money to pay for those expenses, up to what the college charges for room and board. So you can do that as well. And then 529 money can also be used for books and your computer. And then the IRS has a list of what other qualified expenses are, but those are the big categories and the big expenses.Dziubinski: Now, in some states also 529 plans can be used for some K through 12 expenses. Is that right? Oey: Yes, that's correct. The federal government put that in one of their recent acts. And at the state level, not all states have agreed to this idea. And so what happens is that if you're in a state which does not allow that, what will happen is that when you take money out of your 529 and then use it to pay for K through 12 private-school tuition, it will not account as a qualified expense, and then you will be charged a penaltyDziubinski: Got it. Now, another myth, perhaps, is that investors are better off sticking with their own-state-sponsored 529 plan because they're going to get some sort of tax benefit in doing so. But not all states offer a tax benefit. Right?Oey: Right. Yes, about a handful of states don't offer any state tax benefit. And when we say \"tax benefit,\" we mean state income tax. So like a deduction when you're calculating your state income tax liability. Some states don't offer it. Some states like Florida and Nevada, they don't have an income tax, so there's no benefit to offer. And then maybe about 30 states offer some kind of benefit, but it's important to consider what the benefit is. For one example: Rhode Island, the maximum deduction you can take is $1,000. If you just kind of back-of-the-envelope estimate, if you're a family, you make $100,000 a year, you file jointly, if you make $1,000 contribution to a 529 account or three, you can only deduct $1,000. And then given their tax rates, that's only a savings of like $50, which is not that significant. Other states have a higher limit on how much you can deduct. And maybe if the state taxes are also higher, that same family contributing $3,000, maybe that's worth a couple of hundred dollars per year. Dziubinski: Even if your state does offer a tax deduction or a tax benefit, like you're talking about, there are reasons sometimes where you wouldn't even, nevertheless, you wouldn't stick with your state's plan.Oey: Right. If the tax benefit is not attractive, but also you can look at the plan. If the investment options are fairly mediocre and, then again, if the fees are really high, definitely you can consider looking at other plans. At Morningstar, we do rate over 60 plans. Some of the summaries of our ratings are available on our website. And if you're a subscriber, you can also look at the individual reports on the individual plans.Dziubinski: Another myth is that there are contribution limits to 529 plans, which maybe change annually the way contribution limits change to IRAs or 401(k)s, but that's not the case, right?Oey: I mean, technically, when you contribute into a 529 account, it's considered a gift. So it's subject to the gift tax. And so the exclusion in 2022 is $16,000. And that is per beneficiary, per giver. So, I can give $16,000 to son number one, I can give $16,000 to son number two, and then if my husband wanted to, he can do the same, effectively doubling our gift. If you were to go over the exclusion, it just counts against your lifetime exclusion, which is $12 million.Dziubinski: Patty, another myth that some people believe is that 529 plans will get in the way of how much financial aid a child will qualify for. Is that true?Oey: Yes, this is a very popular question, and a lot of people are concerned about it. When you want to apply for financial aid, you have to fill out the FAFSA form. What the government does is that it evaluates how much the parents can contribute for your education. So they look at the parents' income\u2014that is weighed most heavily in terms of how much the parents can afford to pay for school. They also look at savings; that's weighed a lot less, and in that savings bucket includes 529 but also includes bank accounts and other investment accounts. But the idea is that if you are going to be using savings to pay for the school, then it just makes a lot of sense to invest in a 529 account with the tax benefits. But overall, anything that you do to reduce the potential need for more debt in the future will benefit the child in the future.Dziubinski: And then lastly, some might think, \"OK, well, I want to set up a 529 plan, but I'm a little uncertain whether the beneficiary is going to pursue a college education, and then what happens to the money? Is it taxed? Is it gone? What happens?\" And that's not really the case? What are some things that can be done with 529 assets if, in fact, that beneficiary decides not to pursue what people might think of as a traditional four-year college education?Oey: Right? Yeah\u2014money disappearing? Nobody wants to hear that. So yes, the child maybe gets a full scholarship or decides not to go to school, there are options. The tax code is pretty liberal. You can change the beneficiary. And typically, you can change it to another member of the family, and they are reasonably liberal, where you can change it to another child, but you can also change it to a niece or nephew, a cousin, and also spouses. The IRS has the list, but it's pretty broad in terms of who you can change it to. There's no tax liability for that change. Some might say that there's always the risk that the government will change the laws in the future, and then you know, that would be a problem. That's not on the table right now. It's not a concern at this moment.Dziubinski: Great. Well, Patty, thank you so much for helping bust some of these 529 myths. We appreciate your time.Oey: Thank you.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

Overall, the firms most frequently trusted to manage those assets\u2014Vanguard, Capital Group, and Fidelity\u2014remained the same over the past three years. 529 plans are sponsored by individual states, which partner with asset managers, record keepers, or banks to select the investments and to design and manage the plan. Vanguard, Capital Group, and Fidelity are attractive partners, offering strong and broad lineups of mutual funds and well-resourced multi-asset investment teams with established track records.Individually, Vanguard is synonymous with diversification and low fees, Capital Group is renowned for its compelling actively managed offerings, and Fidelity brings together its strength in both active and passive investing to offer more choices to investors. Together, these three firms are responsible for over half of 529 assets under management and their proclivities provide an interesting snapshot of the industry.     VanguardVanguard has more 529 assets than any other firm, with an estimated 30% market share of assets under management. Out of 86 education savings plans, 15 hold all-Vanguard lineups for the equity and bond exposures in their age-based or target-enrollment series. About 10 other plans have offerings where a majority of assets are in Vanguard funds but also include funds from other families. Across all these plans, the most common holdings are Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VSMPX, Vanguard Total International Stock Index VTPSX, and Vanguard Total Bond Market Index VBMPX. Most also hold Vanguard Total International Bond Index VTIFX, and some hold Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index VTSPX. These funds are diversified and attractively priced, a combination of characteristics that continues to support each of their medalist Morningstar Analyst Ratings.     While these plans benefit from this straightforward fund lineup, we have different ratings across plans that hold Vanguard funds in their age-based or target-enrollment series. States that choose Vanguard funds do so because of low fees, simplicity, and broad diversification. But some states do not follow Vanguard's recommendations on how to combine and employ these holdings in an age-based or target-enrollment series. For example, Neutral-rated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan offers four risk tracks, instead of Vanguard's recommended three. The Iowa plan also deviates from Vanguard's glide path of 12.5% equity step-downs, with its Aggressive Growth and Growth options exhibiting large single-day 20% and 30% cuts in equities at the end of the glide path. This exposes investors to market-timing risk and drives our Negative Process rating in this instance. The other two Neutral-rated plans, Arkansas' Brighter Future Direct and North Dakota's College SAVE Plan, are weighed by relatively high fees and weak state oversight.     Capital GroupCapital Group (the parent company of American Funds) has the second-largest market share at 20%, or $93 billion in assets. This is accomplished with one plan, CollegeAmerica, which Capital Group manages with minimal interference from its state partner Virginia. This Bronze-rated plan benefits from Capital Group's dedicated multi-asset specialists and seasoned equity and fixed-income investors. CollegeAmerica offers a target-enrollment series with a relatively smooth glide path, and features well-regarded actively managed funds, 87% of which received a Morningstar Medalist rating as of May 2022. While CollegeAmerica earns praise for its investment team and underlying processes, this advisor-sold plan is pricey.     FidelityThe firm with the third-largest market share, at about 9%, is Fidelity. Unlike Capital Group's single plan, Fidelity runs a number of plans and has had long, 20-plus-year partnerships with states such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Delaware. In 2021, the firm won two new mandates and now serves as the program manager for Connecticut's direct- and advisor-sold plans. This brings the total number of plans under Fidelity's purview to eight.     Across these plans, Fidelity offers the same glide path designed by the firm's experienced and well-resourced asset-allocation team. The direct-sold plans provide the option of three tracks (one that uses all actively managed Fidelity funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a mix) and the advisor-sold offers one active track. The underlying holdings are all Fidelity Series funds, many of which are clones of Morningstar Medalists or are managed by Fidelity's top managers such as Jed Weiss for Fidelity Series International Growth FIGSX, Ford O'Neill for Fidelity Series Investment Grade Bond FSIGX, and Matthew Fruhan for Fidelity Series Large Cap Stock FGLGX. Though it manages less 529 assets than either Vanguard or Capital Group, Fidelity provides choice (active, passive, or a blend), and that contributes to its ongoing appeal.Asset managers trailing behind these three market share leaders in 529 assets are firms such as Columbia, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, Nuveen, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Voya, which each hold market shares of 1% to 8%. This is the fourth in a five-article series on 529 college savings plans.

If you're a minimalist, it may be tempting to buy a good-quality balanced fund and call it a day. Especially if you're just starting out and the assets in the college savings plan are still small, it may seem like overkill to manage a college portfolio with lots of moving parts.There are certainly worse ways to go about saving for college (life insurance, anyone?). But before you invest your college savings in anything, it's worth considering how investing for college is different from saving for that other long-term goal--retirement. Those differences, in turn, argue for taking a more hands-on approach to asset allocation than a balanced fund would allow. Nor do target-retirement vehicles fit as one-stop options for college savers. Truncated Time HorizonIn contrast to retirement, your child's college matriculation year isn't a negotiable date. A person who encounters a bear market shortly before retirement may have some wiggle room to keep working or rely on other sources of income to avoid tapping his nest egg at a low ebb. But try telling your 18-year-old that he'll have to wait until age 21 to start school so that his college fund will have time to recover.In addition, your time horizon for saving for college is much shorter than is the case for retirement, as is the time horizon for spending those assets. One might save for retirement for 40 years or more and be retired for another 30 or 35 years. But you have less than half that amount of time to amass the funds needed for college, and if all goes well, you'll spend down those assets quickly--in four years or so, or perhaps a few more if you're also footing the bill for graduate school.Both of those facts call for a much steeper glide path--the gradual shift from more-volatile investments such as stocks to more-conservative investments such as bonds--in the years leading up to and during college than the typical glide path before and during retirement. A college portfolio's asset allocation should begin downshifting into cash and bonds when the child is in grade school, and the portfolio should be dominated by bonds by the time the child is in high school. That's because an equity-heavy college fund that encounters a bear market in the years leading up to college could incur losses that it couldn't recoup during the student's time horizon. Even parents who worry that they're grievously behind on college savings should resist the urge to swing for the fences by maintaining a too-high equity allocation too long. (That may be a great temptation for college savers right now, as stocks have trumped bonds and cash over the past decade.)Inflation a Bigger FoeYet college savers must strike a tricky balance because the risks of being too conservative also loom large. Inflation is a major foe for college savers, and a portfolio heavy in bonds and cash could have trouble keeping up with rising tuition costs.While college costs have come under some pressure very recently, the college inflation rate has been double the rate of general inflation since 2001. But current yields have historically been a good predictor of future bond returns, and the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, which serves as a broad bond market benchmark, is currently yielding about 1.7%. That means that investors with extremely conservative asset-allocation plans are going to have difficulty matching the rate of college inflation. Finding a BaselineGiven the specific considerations that should go into a college savings allocation plan, it's probably no wonder that the age-based options within 529 college savings plans have historically held the lion's share of assets. Age-based options aim to provide age-appropriate asset mixes that gradually become more conservative over time, and in so doing they take the onus off of parents and other family members to arrive at an optimal asset mix and to provide ongoing oversight of a portfolio of individual holdings.But the age-based plans also vary widely in their glide paths, and plans are increasingly offering multiple options for a given age band: conservative, moderate, and aggressive. That makes it important to conduct due diligence on a prospective plan's asset-allocation framework and see how it compares with other options within that same general age band. If it's an outlier, make sure you understand and agree with the rationale that its managers use for diverging from the peer group.After you select a plan from your (or any other) state from Morningstar's 529 Plan Center map you can see how that state's age-based glide path compares with the 529 averages for that same age band. For example, the Silver-rated Maryland Senator Edward J Kasemeyer College Investment Plan, managed by T. Rowe Price Group TROW, has a heavier equity weighting (green bar) than its peers (gray mountain chart), especially for younger children with several years until college.Even families who aren't using an age-based 529 option can still use 529 glide paths to help get their own plans' asset mixes in the right ballpark. In the table below are the median net equity, bond, and cash weightings for each of Morningstar's age-based 529 categories. You can see that the plans start out with the majority of their assets in equities, then gradually become more conservative over time.","Article Author":"Christine Benz","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Jan 19, 2022"},"6":{"Article Title":" 3 Themes Shaping the Future of 529 Savings Plans     ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1040262\/3-themes-shaping-the-future-of-529-savings-plans","Article Content":"As a graduation month, May augurs promise. Students reflect on the knowledge they have acquired and how to put it to use going forward.In a year when many 529 savings plans reached the same age as the college graduates who've tapped their tax-advantaged coffers, it makes sense to consider how these savings tools have evolved, how they can improve, and what they might offer going forward.Since Morningstar assigned its first forward-looking ratings to 529 savings plans in 2012, we've witnessed multiple improvements to these tax-advantaged investing programs as assets climbed from $167 billion to $394 billion. In the 2021 529 Savings Plan Landscape, we identify a few trends that will continue to shape these plans for investors saving for college, K-12, or other types of education expenses going forward. Morningstar Direct and Office clients can access the full paper here.Asset-allocation practices continue to change. There are now 3 times as many portfolios using gradual glide paths to reduce their risk over time--either with target enrollment approaches or age-based steps of less than 10%--than there were in 2016.529 savings plans now offer more flexibility than at any time since they were introduced. Once, investors could only use 529 savings plan assets to pay for college expenses. But as the list of qualified education expenses has grown, 529s are nearing a future where it could be possible for beneficiaries to tap their savings throughout their working lives when personal, social, or economic forces spur them to pivot to new careers or learn new skills, as the pandemic has prompted many to do recently.Several highly populated states are working to broaden the accessibility of 529 savings plans through initiatives like child savings accounts.The Past Year's Top TrendsLast year pandemic-driven campus and economic shutdowns spurred college tuition inflation to sink nearly 50% from a historical 10-year average of 2.8%. Our research shows that all but two 529 portfolios met their goal of beating tuition inflation over the past three years.As ever, falling fees across the investment industry have been a boon to 529 beneficiaries, though direct-sold options continue to have an advantage over advisor-sold options, whose average fee is 0.54 percentage points higher. In fact, as shown below, no advisor-sold age-based tracks fall in the cheapest or second-cheapest quintiles. And when it comes to college savings, every dollar paid in fees is one less dollar for educational expenses.     Portfolio improvements haven't all gone smoothly. In early 2021, education savers in The Vanguard 529 Plan got a lucky break that may have amounted to over $200 million in extra earnings. In October 2020, Vanguard applied the wrong recommendations in Nevada's The Vanguard 529 Plan, leaving its accountholders with 20 percentage points more in stocks than they should have had. Luckily, this occurred as equity markets rallied in late 2020 and early 2021, so the mistake actually helped investors.Nevada, the plan's investment consultant, and Vanguard didn't notice the mistake for several months before fixing it in March, illustrating that vigilant implementation is as important as plan structure, even for straightforward portfolios like Vanguard's. This is reflected in our updated 529 plan ratings methodology, which assigns value to diligent stewardship and thoughtful collaboration between a state and its program manager or investment consultant. Sharper Asset Allocation in 529 Savings PlansAge-based portfolios are typically the most popular investment options in a 529 savings plan's lineup, followed by static options. These portfolios start out with more equity-heavy asset allocations and transition to conservative portfolios dominated by fixed income as beneficiaries near enrollment, requiring thoughtful curation.There are two types of transitions from stocks to bonds, commonly called glide paths:An age-based glide path makes abrupt shifts to bonds from stocks at predetermined dates by moving assets from one investment option to another, often every few years on a particular date.A progressive track keeps investors' assets in a single investment option--similar to a target-date retirement fund--and uses smaller, more frequent asset-allocation adjustments. This provides a smoother transition that is less susceptible to locking in losses if a rebalance occurs during a period of extreme market stress.Our research shows asset-allocation rebalances of 10 percentage points or less mitigate much of this market risk.Over time, these age-based portfolios have improved by incorporating more gradual risk reductions. As shown below, the percentage of 529 savings plans with large (21% and above) equity steps has steadily decreased (from 41% in 2016 to a mere 3% in 2020) as the percentage of plans with progressive glide paths or minimized equity step-downs (10% or less) has markedly increased (from 21% in 2016 to 58% in 2020). The percentage of plans with a moderate equity step-down (11% to 20%) remained steady at roughly 40% in each of the past five years.     Enhanced Flexibility on Approved Education ExpensesOnce investors could only use 529 savings plan assets to pay for qualified college expenses, but 529 plans now offer far more flexibility than at any time since they were introduced. In 2017, K-12 educational expenses joined the list of approved uses for the funds, and the 2019 Secure Act made it possible to pay for apprenticeship programs and cover up to $10,000 in outstanding student loan debt. If they keep evolving like this, 529 savings plans could morph into tax-advantaged pools of assets that beneficiaries could tap throughout their working lives in order to pivot to new careers or learn new skills.Today, investors with nontraditional time horizons or lumpy expenses can use static options, which are stand-alone investments that don't shift asset allocations over time. These options span the risk spectrum, from money market funds all the way to international-stock funds, and plans usually have an array of options for investors to choose from. If flexible spending gains popularity, 529 savings plans could start offering asset-allocation options managed to indefinite horizons, as health savings accounts do.Treading New Ground to Make Education AccessibleState-sponsored education plans took their current shape under section 529 of the tax code over 21 years ago. Through tax incentives that encourage families to invest over time to fund education expenses, these plans help reduce the burden of education loans on young adults and their families. However, from a tax perspective, higher-income families have benefited the most from these incentives. Currently, joint filers making $80,000 or less don't pay taxes on investment gains in taxable accounts. This, in turn, has shaped 529 plan participation, which skews to wealthier households.Many states are working to broaden the accessibility of these investment tools to include lower-income households. Child savings accounts are one idea. These state programs, such as Pennsylvania's Keystone Scholars program (launched in 2019), seed 529 savings accounts with an initial deposit, typically ranging from $50 to $100, for every baby born to or adopted by in-state families. Illinois and California plan to launch similar programs soon. Combined, these three states' initiatives will expand the availability of these accounts to families within three of the 10 largest states in the United States.Child savings accounts encourage lower-income households to start making regular contributions early, but they also may limit savers' choices and lock them into subpar in-state 529 savings plans. Whether a 529 plan has an associated child savings account or not doesn't affect its Morningstar Analyst Rating, which focuses on the people, parent, and process that directly support a plan. Plans with child savings accounts, though, may appeal to investors who consider environmental, social, and governance factors in their decisions since the programs attempt to help solve a social issue.","Article Author":"Madeline Hume","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"May 20, 2021"},"7":{"Article Title":" When Should You Start Saving for College?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1010710\/when-should-you-start-saving-for-college","Article Content":"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Last month, Morningstar released its annual ratings of the best 529 college savings plans for 2020. But choosing a good plan isn't enough. Time is an important part of the equation. Joining me today to discuss when you should start saving for college is Madeline Hume. Madeline is an analyst in Morningstar's Manager Research group on the multi-asset team.Thanks for being here today, Madeline.Madeline Hume: Thank you so much for having me, Susan. Dziubinski: Let's start off by talking a little bit about the ratings. Morningstar made some methodology changes to the ratings this year. Can you talk a little bit about those?Hume: Absolutely. One of the changes that we made was to make our ratings simpler. We now rate four underlying pillars instead of five that roll up to our overall ratings of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. Our Performance Pillar is now getting absorbed into other assessments. Another was to provide greater transparency into what's really driving our ratings, with our written analysis expressing our pillar ratings across the five-point scale, ranging from High to Low.Our Price Pillar puts even greater emphasis on the absolute value of a plan's fees and now conveys our assessment of a plan's fees irrespective of its distribution channel or the strategy of the underlying investment options. As a result, this new methodology favors direct-sold plans over advisor-sold plans. Given how much the investments that 529 plans hold have improved over recent years, our new People Pillar emphasizes the team behind a plan's investment options, which raises the bar for a plan's investment resources. We also don't include any tax benefits in our analysis anymore, given how highly individualized the benefits that individuals receive from contributing to a 529 plan can be.Dziubinski: Given those changes to our methodology, which plans came out with our highest rating of Gold? Did they share any particular traits?Hume: Yes. Two plans were reaffirmed at Gold this year. Bright Start Direct out of Illinois and Utah's my529 plan. Joining them this year was a new entrant, which was Michigan's Education Savings Program. These plans are all unique, but what they have in common is low costs, strong stewardship, and exceptional asset allocation. Any investor that finds themselves in these plans can have confidence that they've made an excellent choice. Dziubinski: And let's look at the flip side. What are some plans that didn't fare quite as well under our new approach?Hume: Our enhanced methodology does set a higher standard for Neutral ratings, and six plans failed to reach that bar for the first time this year, receiving downgrades to Negative and joining two other plans that were previously given that designation. Five of these downgrades were for those more expensive advisor-sold plans that I mentioned. And all eight of these plans currently charge fees that investors are better off avoiding even if they live in a state that provides some tax benefits for investing in that plan. Some may also have significant design flaws, like large allocation steps.Dziubinski: If someone is looking to open a 529 college savings account, how can they use these ratings to help inform that decision?Hume: Our Medalist-rated plans carry our strongest recommendations from Gold at the highest level down to Bronze. For investors that live in a state with no state-specific income tax benefits or if you have a home state that earns one of these designations, you need look no further than this short list. However, many states offer state-specific incentives and may make up for a so-so plan, which we would give a Neutral rating under our methodology. Again, we don't take those tax benefits into account anymore, given how highly specific each tax situation for a college saver is. So, in those cases, investors should weigh the potential cost savings of a yearly tax benefit against the higher expense ratios and lower-quality investments that these plans provide, ideally in consultation with a financial advisor.Dziubinski: Now, many of these age-based plans work under the assumption that these assets are invested for 18 years. But given how hard choosing a plan can be and saving for college can be, when have you found that families actually start saving for college?Hume: Right. We conducted a study last year that shows that the average 529 account is open when a child is 7 years old and that only gives him 11 years to save for college. That makes an already compressed investing time horizon that much more fraught, and a lot of these plans are designed with 18-year time horizons in mind, so investors aren't getting the full utility out of these plans that they offer.Dziubinski: Then what's the opportunity cost to an investor by starting so late?Hume: Based on that study, to put it into context, for a $50,000 total savings balance, even one additional year that investors delay can cost some potential gains of up to $5,900 depending on when that account is open.Dziubinski: Now, that's significant. What if you are one of those late-start college savers? Do you have any suggestions for those people and what they might be able to do to play a little catch-up?Hume: Right. It's tough. College savers who start investing in 529 plans later do miss out on those equity-heavy portfolios with the most growth potential. While stocks are certainly more volatile than bonds, they do have greater return potential over the long run, and each year that investors wait lowers the growth potential of their savings as age-based portfolios gradually de-risk. College savers may be tempted to make up for lost time by making large contributions or taking on additional risk in their portfolios, but it is hard to make up for years of missed compounding, which underscores the virtue of saving for college as soon as possible. However, college savers do have some benefits that other investment savers like retirement savers don't have, which include student loans and other kind of less traditional investment options. It's prudent to consider the entire menu of options that are available to college savers beyond just the 529 account.Dziubinski: Madeleine, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate it.Hume: Thank you so much, Susan.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski for Morningstar. Thank you for tuning in.","Article Author":"Madeline Hume,  Susan Dziubinski","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Dec 1, 2020"},"8":{"Article Title":" What Bad Returns at the Wrong Time Can Mean for College    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1003382\/what-bad-returns-at-the-wrong-time-can-mean-for-college","Article Content":"I\u2019ve written a couple of articles about how sequence-of-returns risk can affect portfolio values both for retirees making portfolio withdrawals, and younger investors who are putting money away for the future. The order in which returns unfold over time is important because it can affect the dollar value of a portfolio that has cash flows from contributions or withdrawals. In a nutshell, the periods when more dollars are invested will carry more weight in your overall results.In this article, I'll explain how even a year or two of bad equity-market returns can affect portfolio values for college savers and give some practical tips for dealing with this risk. I'll focus mainly on 529 plans, which we've covered extensively as one of the best vehicles available for families planning ahead to cover the costs of college education.Background The sequence of returns typically comes up in the context of investing for retirement. A negative sequence of returns during the first few years of retirement can be detrimental because it's a double whammy: It cuts into the portfolio's value right away, but can also put long-term sustainability at risk because as retirees make withdrawals, there's less money left to benefit from an eventual market recovery.  The situation is a bit different for parents or other relatives planning ahead for a child's college education, because both savings and withdrawals are made over a shorter period. While younger investors can invest for retirement over a period of four decades or more, parents usually only have about 18 years to put money away for college. And withdrawals made to pay for college costs typically take place over about four years, compared with a much longer (but ultimately unknown) time horizon for retirees.Because of this compressed time horizon, the main risk for college savers isn't technically the sequence of returns, but really the risk of an equity-market downturn that happens shortly before planned withdrawals start. It's also worth noting that investors can sidestep this risk by using age-based investment options that automatically ratchet down their equity exposure based on the child\u2019s age. Surprisingly, though, age-based and target-enrollment portfolios account for only about a third of all 529 plan assets, with the remainder invested in static allocation portfolios.As with saving for retirement, negative equity-market returns are less of an issue early on. If you're just starting to invest in a 529 plan or other college-savings vehicle for a newborn or young child, a year or two of negative returns won\u2019t dramatically affect your long-term results. But as the portfolio value increases, the risk of too much equity exposure becomes more dangerous. This makes the last few years before your child starts college critically important. In a worst-case scenario, a market downturn later in high school--right in the middle of the usual swirl of activity with college visits, standardized tests, and last-minute applications--could depress the portfolio\u2019s value right before you\u2019ll need to start making tuition payments. Let\u2019s look at a couple of examples to see how this can play out in practice. For illustration purposes, I used an all-equity portfolio and assumed that parents or other college savers contributed $1,000 per year from a child\u2019s birth up through age 18. That\u2019s on the low end given recent costs for tuition, room, and board, but the same patterns would apply with larger contribution amounts. The table below shows portfolio values for a child born in 1984 assuming consistent annual contributions and actual equity market performance through 2002.Exhibit 1: How Sequence of Returns Can Hurt College Savings     Source: Author's calculations. Note: Portfolio values based on $1,000 annual contributions (not adjusted for inflation) and actual returns for the S&P 500 from 1984 to 2002.Up until age 15, this was a pretty positive period for market performance. The portfolio kept chugging along with positive total returns almost every single year, suffering only a small loss in 1990. Assets would have peaked (reaching nearly $94,000) around the child\u2019s freshman year of high school. But with the tech correction starting in 2000, things started to go south. After three straight years of market losses, the portfolio would have shed more than a third of its value by the end of 2002. If the sequence of returns had been reversed, the picture would be far brighter. The chart below shows the portfolio\u2019s value over a hypothetical period during which the S&P 500 earned the same returns as it did from 1984 through 2002, but in reverse order.Despite a rough start with three straight years of negative returns, the portfolio\u2019s value would reach more than $108,000 by the end of the period--about $47,000 higher than in the previous example. That would give the family far more flexibility; they could opt for a more-expensive college, carry over some assets to cover the cost of graduate school, or transfer assets to a younger sibling or other family member. (This is one attractive aspect of 529 plans; account owners can change the plan's beneficiary as long as the new assignee is a family member of the previous one.)Exhibit 2: Different Sequence, Different Results     Source: Author's calculations. Note: Portfolio values based on $1,000 annual contributions (not adjusted for inflation) and actual returns for the S&P 500 from 2002 to 1984 (in reverse order). Mitigating the Risk Of course, these are extreme examples; maintaining an all-equity college fund throughout your child's entire childhood isn't prudent or advisable. And in fact, adding a healthy stake in fixed-income securities is one of the best ways to offset the potential risk of equity-market losses. Although bonds can also be subject to risk from return patterns over time, returns typically fall in a smaller range and can help buffer some of the risk of an equity market downturn. But because of the relatively short time period of a typical four-year college education, a year or two of bad returns at the wrong time can still create problems for more-balanced portfolios. The table below shows the potential impact of the 2008 bear market as an example. While the correction was pretty short-lived, it still would have had a lasting impact, even for a portfolio with a 40% stake in bonds. The bond position helped buffer some of the losses, but the portfolio would have still shed about 20% of its value in 2008. Even with positive total returns for the next three years, the portfolio would have fallen short of the amount needed to cover planned withdrawals of $100,000 over four years.     To avoid this problem, it makes sense to shift toward a much more conservative asset mix in the years leading up to college. As mentioned above, age-based and target-enrollment portfolios can be a sensible, low-effort way to keep risk exposure at the right level. Almost all 529 plans offer these options, which automatically shift their asset mixes more toward cash and bonds as the beneficiary approaches college age.A typical asset mix would be mostly equity starting at birth, gradually shifting down to about 60% in stocks at age 9, 40% at age 13, 30% at age 15, 20% at age 17, and 14% at age 18. Not every age-based track makes gradual adjustments, though. Age-based tracks shift their equity exposure on predetermined dates, and some age-based tracks (such as Iowa's growth track) sell out of 20% or more in stocks on a single day. If stocks happen to sink on the same day, 529 plan owners could end up effectively locking in those losses, exacerbating the risk of a shortfall.Exhibit 4: Median Equity Allocation by Age     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 8\/31\/2020. Equity weightings reflect target equity allocations for 529 plan portfolios in Morningstar's database.Many 529 plans also offer options for different levels of risk, typically labeled as aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The aggressive option for Utah\u2019s 529 plan, for example, targets 70% equity exposure for age 10, compared with 50% for the moderate track and 30% for the conservative option. Choosing the right mix is a matter of personal preference, but also depends on each family\u2019s circumstances. If you want to help finance post-graduate studies or plan to \u201coverfund\u201d the 529 plan with a view toward saving for future beneficiaries, tilting a bit more toward stocks might make sense, as long as you\u2019re willing to live with the additional risk.Do-it-yourself investors can also build a more customized asset mix. In addition to age-based options, most 529 plans offer individual funds that can be used as building blocks for targeting a specific blend of stocks, bonds, and cash. One relatively straightforward option would be to focus more on stocks early on, then shift into a balanced fund combining stocks and bonds, and then gradually build up more bonds and cash during the high-school years.Conclusion Planning for college can be an overwhelming task, and trying to avoid bad returns at the wrong time adds another layer of complexity. But making sure your college fund's asset mix isn't too heavy on stocks--especially as your child approaches college age--is one way to avoid an unexpected outcome.","Article Author":"Amy Arnott","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Oct 5, 2020"},"9":{"Article Title":" How to Avoid Paying Extra Taxes on Your College Refund    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/983931\/how-to-avoid-paying-extra-taxes-on-your-college-refund","Article Content":"Editor\u2019s note: Read the latest on how the coronavirus is rattling the markets and what investors can do to navigate it.If you haven\u2019t already, you could soon get a refund on certain college expenses as campuses across the country closed and schools shifted to remote learning because of the coronavirus pandemic.But if you used withdrawals from a 529 college savings account to cover these costs, you should handle these refunds with care to avoid tax penalties. Here are some things you should know if you\u2019ve opened a 529 plan to help save for education costs, used the funds on tuition or other qualified expenses, and expect to get a refund because of the recent pandemic changes.How do I avoid tax penalties on my refund? If you don't handle your refund correctly, it could be seen as a withdrawal to cover nonqualified expenses, which would be subject to tax penalties.There are two ways to deal with a refund to avoid paying extra taxes: You can spend the refund on other qualified expenses or put the money back into any 529 account with the same beneficiary. If you choose the latter, the refund must come directly from a college or university, and the timing of when you make the deposit is crucial. What to keep in mind: Typically, 529 account owners must deposit the refund into the account within 60 days or the refund will be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal, which gets a tax penalty.The money does not need to go to the same 529 plan that you made the original withdrawal from, but the refund must go back into a plan with the same beneficiary.If you wait longer than 60 days to deposit the money back into a 529 account, it will be considered a new contribution, and the tax penalty on the refund will still apply.This 60-day rule has shifted slightly in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As stated in IRS Notice 2020-23, 529 account owners who got refunds prior to May 15 now have until July 15 to redeposit the funds into a 529 account. The 60-day window still applies to account owners who receive refunds after May 15.Could I use my refund to cover next year's expenses? While the 60-day period doesn't apply when you choose to use your refund on other qualified expenses, timing is still important if you want to avoid tax penalties.What to keep in mind: You must make your withdrawal in the same tax year that you pay for the qualified expenses.If you file your taxes using a calendar-year period, which is typical, you can use your refund to cover qualified education expenses, like tuition and room and board, for the fall semester because the refund and payment fall in the same tax year.Even if you are technically paying for 2021 costs, the refund will still count as a qualified withdrawal if you make the payment in 2020.What are some expenses that I could use my refund to cover? You can use tax-free withdrawals from a 529 account to pay for qualified expenses (see Section 8 of this IRS document) that include tuition, mandatory fees, books, computers and software. Because many colleges and universities have set up online courses, it may make sense to use the money to pay for Internet access or to purchase a computer.You could also put the refund toward student loans. As part of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, or SECURE Act, up to $10,000 total from a 529 plan can be used to repay the beneficiary\u2019s student loans. This includes federal and most private loans. Further, an additional $10,000 can go toward each of the beneficiary\u2019s siblings\u2019 student loans.Of course, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to using 529 funds. But it\u2019s important for investors to understand what costs you can cover without any tax penalty.What are the tax penalties for nonqualified withdrawals? Transportation, extracurricular activities, health insurance, and other noneducation costs are considered nonqualified expenses.What to keep in mind:Any taxes or extra tax penalties will only apply to the money that your 529 plan's investments earn because the contributions you make have already been taxed.Withdrawals from 529s must be a combination of contributions you made to the account and the money you earn from the plan's investments. For example, if your account has $4,000 in contributions and $6,000 in investment earnings, withdrawing $1,000 takes $400 from contributions and $600 from earnings.Withdrawals for nonqualified expenses get a 10% tax penalty on the investment earnings portion. For example, if you use $1,000 on nonqualified expenses and $600 of the withdrawal come from earnings, you will owe an extra $60 in taxes on top of any income taxes that you owe on that $600.You will owe applicable federal income taxes on your investment earnings but not contributions.You may have to repay any state income tax breaks you received on those contributions.","Article Author":"Margaret Giles","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"May 11, 2020"},"10":{"Article Title":"529 Plans: What\u2019s Changed and What\u2019s the Same?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/personal-finance\/themes-across-529-plan-landscape-6-charts","Article Content":"Since their launch more than 20 years ago, 529 college savings plans have helped students and their families better access higher education through tax-advantaged investing. In this annual industry review, we discuss key themes across the 529 college savings plan landscape, including education inflation, asset growth, declining fees, and more.Backdrop\u2014Education Inflation Is Back on the RiseFor most of the past two decades, the cost of education rose more quickly than the general inflation rate, with the Consumer Price Index growing at 2.5% annually while the Tuition Index grew at 4%. Although this trend reversed in 2020 and has remained so since, it does not mean that education inflation has subsided. Rather, education inflation just briefly paled in comparison to the general price index as the world dealt with some extraordinary issues over the past few years. In fact, rolling 12-month inflation data shows that education inflation is on the rise again, easily surpassing 3% in March 2023. Continually rising tuition costs underpin the importance for families to save early and frequently within a 529\u2032s tax-advantaged structure; the additional time helps harness the effects of compounding to keep up with these increasing costs.\n\t\t\tGrowth of CPI vs. Tuition (Indexed)\n\t\t \n\t\t\tGrowth of CPI vs. Tuition (Indexed) over the past 20 years ended in April 2023.\n\t\t     Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Data as of 05\/30\/2023. 529 Industry Assets Fall in 2022In 2022, we saw a sizable decline in total 529 plan assets, the largest over the past decade, which had been a steady period for growth. Assets in 529 plans decreased by nearly 17% in 2022, dropping to $385 billion by year-end from $461 billion. Hardly any plan was immune to the market decline, with a vast majority of plans experiencing a decrease in total assets; the median loss was 14%. Direct-sold plans, which tend to carry lower fees and have grown faster than advisor-sold plans over the past decade, lost 15.8% on average. On the other hand, an average advisor-sold plan lost 20% of its assets in 2022.\n\t\t\tAssets Under Management by Distribution Channel\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA time series chart showing assets under management by distribution channel.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct, surveyed data, and author\u2019s calculations. Data as of 12\/31\/2022. Glide Paths Have Become Smoother; Plans Pause on Taking Additional Equity RiskMost 529 accountholders utilize an age-based or target-enrollment strategy, which is a set-it-and-forget-it type of investment that starts with a large allocation in risky assets (that is, equities) when the beneficiary is young. As the beneficiary grows older, the portfolio transitions to a more conservative positioning by allocating more to bonds and cash or cashlike accounts. A glide path shows how an age-based or target-enrollment series\u2019 allocation shifts to a more conservative positioning as the beneficiary grows closer to college enrollment. Over the years, Morningstar has cautioned investors against glide paths with large equity steps (21% or more), as they expose investors to market-timing risk. If a portfolio happens to derisk after a large market decline, investors risk locking in their losses and capping their upside by selling stocks at their low and allocating those funds to bonds and cash.In recent years, many plan providers have improved their series by adopting a smoother glide path, and 2022 was no exception. Several plans have adopted a progressive glide path, which makes small (around 2%) asset-allocation changes, typically four times a year. Others have added portfolios to their age-based series so that the equity step-downs (which take place in one day) are 12.5% or less. By the end of 2022, close to 80% of all plans featured equity steps of 10% or less, while series with large step-downs accounted for less than 3% of the industry.\n\t\t\tPercentage of Series by Greatest Equity Step\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA chart showing the percentage of total available age-based\/target-enrollment series by their greatest equity step-downs.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\/31\/2022 The chart below shows the average equity allocation of 166 age-based or target-enrollment series, divided into five groups. The first group, progressive, includes 60 series that typically follow one glide path but may provide choice. For example, plans managed by Fidelity, such as Massachusetts\u2019 U.Fund College Investing Plan, which has a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Bronze, employ one progressive glide path but provide a choice of three series: one that uses all active underlying funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a blend of active and index funds. This group saw several new entrants, including Idaho\u2019s Vanguard Target Enrollment series and Arkansas\u2019 Bright Future Target Enrollment series, launched in April and September 2022, respectively. These new plans harbor varying risk appetites along the glide path. On average, however, there were not any notable changes in the equity allocation.\n\t\t\tAverage Glide Paths for Progressive and Age-Based Series\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA graph showing average glide paths for age-based and target-enrollment series.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\/31\/2022 The remaining four groups follow an age-based stepped glide path. There are 25 plans that offer one glide path option, depicted as \u201cage-based: one option.\u201d This group saw a roughly 2% increase in equity allocation across the glide path. Other plans allow investors to pick their preferred risk profile by providing aggressive, moderate, and conservative options. These \u201ctarget-risk\u201d glide paths saw little increase in equity allocation; in fact, the equity stakes decreased in some parts of the glide path. Fees Continue to FallAverage fees continue to fall across the investment industry, including 529 savings plans. By the end of 2022, the average fee for an age-based or target-enrollment series was 0.46%, a 2-basis-point decline from the year before. Direct-sold plans maintained their fee advantage and slashed another 3 basis points, arriving at an average fee of 0.31%. Advisor-sold plans remained significantly more expensive, with an average fee of 0.83% after a basis-point decline in 2022.\n\t\t\tAverage Total Expense Ratios of Age-Based and Target Enrollment Series\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA chart showing the time-series data for average total expense ratios of age-based\/target-enrollment series.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 05\/30\/2022 Fee reductions can come from multiple sources. A switch to cheaper (often passive) underlying funds is one way. For example, Bronze-rated Florida 529 Savings Plan switched to index funds in the target enrollment series in 2022 and became the cheapest plan in the industry. Illinois\u2019 Bronze-rated Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 plan also added an all-passive track in November 2022 that features Vanguard and iShares index funds, offering a cheaper option to its investors. Other plans have trimmed their state fees and\/or negotiated with their program manager for lower fees. Plans with a growing and relatively larger asset base can achieve some economies of scale, which can be passed on to investors through lower fees. For instance, Silver-rated Oregon College Savings Plan met its $2.5 billion breakpoint in 2022, resulting in a slight reduction to its asset-based fees. Moreover, as the team saw stable asset growth, it cut its administrative fee by 5 basis points.\n\t\t\tAge-Based and Target-Enrollment Series Fees by Distribution and Allocation in Active Funds\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA scatterplot showing the distribution of age-based and target-enrollment series' allocation to active funds and their average total expense ratio.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\/31\/2022 Advisor-sold plans remain more expensive on average than direct-sold plans, partially because of their higher allocation to actively managed strategies (see chart above). While holding actively managed strategies itself is not a flaw, investors need to ensure that the fees do not eat into their investment returns. For instance, New Hampshire\u2019s Fidelity Advisor 529 Plan earns a High People rating thanks to its impressive lineup of active managers. However, a hefty price tag that ranges from 0.67% to 1.85% keeps its rating at Neutral.Having said that, advisor-sold plans can hold index funds and still be expensive because of sales and distribution fees paid to the advisor. For instance, Maine offers an advisor-sold series that only holds low-cost index funds. The weighted average fee for the underlying index funds is just 8-10 basis points, but after adding program management, administrative, and distribution fees, the average total expense ratio ranges from 0.57% to 1.37%.As the Price Pillar accounts for 30% of the Morningstar Medalist Rating for 529 plans, there are very few advisor-sold plans that earn a Bronze rating or higher. As of June 2023, only three such plans exist: Illinois Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 Plan, Ohio\u2019s BlackRock CollegeAdvantage, and Virginia\u2019s CollegeAmerica. All three earn Above Average or High ratings in all pillars besides Price, reflecting a well-thought-out process, high-caliber investment personnel, and\/or exemplary oversight. Morningstar doesn\u2019t prefer active or passive funds for age-based or target-enrollment series. In fact, we recognize promising 529 plans offering series across the active-passive spectrum. However, our research has consistently shown that, over time, lower-fee options provide a reliable edge relative to peers. Lower fees present lower performance hurdles, putting less pressure on portfolio managers to take more risk to make up their funds\u2019 costs. It\u2019s hard even for outstanding asset allocation and talented managers to consistently overcome high costs, especially when their styles are out of favor. Low fees, however, are a dependable advantage that compounds over time and can lead to better investor outcomes.","Article Author":"Hyunmin Kim","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Jun 12, 2023"},"11":{"Article Title":"2 Top-Rated 529 Plans","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/personal-finance\/2-top-rated-529-plans","Article Content":"Morningstar currently rates 54 529 plans, representing 93% of the assets in the industry. Of those 54, two receive our top mark of Gold, reflecting our highest confidence in the plans\u2019 ability to provide participants with compelling investment results.While these two plans may not be the best options for everyone (once personal preferences or tax situations come into the picture), they serve as examples of what is possible in a 529 plan, and it behooves diligent investors to take note.Why? Because best-in-class standards help an investor shape expectations and make a selection, even as applied to a subset of 529 options best suited to their personal profiles. Below, we discuss some of the features that distinguish the two Gold-rated plans from their peers. Before We Start: Applying Morningstar\u2019s Medalist Rating to 529 PlansMorningstar\u2019s Medalist Rating for 529 plans considers four supporting pillars:PeopleProcessParentPriceFor each pillar, we look for what we believe are best-in-class industry practices, including:Skilled investment teams with experience managing multi-asset strategies;A well-researched asset-allocation approach;A robust process for selecting investments and managing risk;The state agency\u2019s ability to provide thoughtful oversight and stewardship; andLower fees relative to Morningstar Category peers in age-based or target-enrollment options.The pillar scores are then rolled up to arrive at a Morningstar Medalist Rating, which reflects our analysts\u2019 confidence in each plan\u2019s ability to offer a compelling risk-adjusted performance relative to peers.First-Rate Plans: Michigan and UtahAs of May 2023, the two plans that hold Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold are the Michigan Education Savings Program and Utah\u2019s my529. Each offers a well-designed age-based or target-enrollment series, which are set-it-and-forget-it investment options that gradually derisk during the accumulation and savings period. They also employ a solid menu of static options of mutual funds and\/or exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to individual asset classes and a safe vehicle to park cash, such as an FDIC-insured savings account.\n\t\t\tTwo Top-Rated 529 Plans\n\t\t      Utah: Customization for Experienced InvestorsUtah\u2019s my529 has consistently been one of our favorite offerings, setting industry standards on many fronts and currently differentiating itself from peers with customization capabilities.The series employs a progressive glide path, which starts with a 100% allocation to equities and falls to 17% by enrollment. This gradual shift is an industry best practice, as it helps education savers avoid the risk of meaningfully shifting out of equities just after a market dip, when there is the potential to lock in losses. The underlying lineup using Vanguard index funds provides broad market exposure at a low cost. This design earns it an Above Average Process rating. The fees for these portfolios are low, at 0.14%-0.15%. The team behind my529 boasts topnotch resources, underpinning a High People rating. Instead of hiring an investment manager for the plan, the state employs its own well-resourced and experienced investment team. A dedicated group of roughly 75 professionals handles everything from portfolio management to recordkeeping. The team also receives support from an investment advisory committee and multiple independent consultants. These additional resources and insights provide an edge compared with the typical 529 peer. We rate the state parent as High because its centralized oversight structure allows for engaged stewardship of the plan, and the state has earnestly continued to reduce fees.One distinctive feature that only the Utah plan offers is the ability to create a custom series in which investors design their own glide path and select the underlying investments. The investment menu includes 22 options, such as Vanguard index funds and DFA funds that cover broad asset classes, style and size, and strategies with a sustainable investment focus. Given the degree of customization for this option, it is suitable for experienced investors or those who work with an investment advisor.Michigan: Low Cost, Easy to UseMichigan Education Savings Program offers an easy-to-use, straightforward series with extremely low average fees of 0.10%. Michigan also employs a progressive glide path, but one slightly flatter than Utah\u2019s, as it starts with an 80% equity allocation and lands at 20% by college enrollment. (This can result in some performance differences depending on the market environment.)This shape is influenced by the historical average age of the beneficiary when the account opens. This prudent approach aids investors who may have delayed saving for education expenses and supports a High Process rating. The enrollment-date portfolios hold mostly index funds, with a slightly more diversified lineup relative to Utah, as it also includes REITs, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and high-yield bonds.This plan was designed via an effective collaboration between the Michigan Bureau of Investments and its dedicated program manager TIAA, driving its Above Average People rating. Michigan, with its investment staff, conducts in-house research and taps participant studies to make informed investment decisions on behalf of beneficiaries. For instance, the state worked closely with TIAA to design the target enrollment glide path that came into effect in 2020. It also pushed for improvements in the underlying lineup, resulting in an offering that includes highly rated Vanguard, iShares, Schwab, and TIAA funds. This move also resulted in lower fees for the series, and the plan continues to be among the cheapest in the industry. Their dedication to shaping a simple, low-cost plan around their participants\u2019 evolving needs also supports a High Parent rating.ConclusionThe two Gold-rated 529 plans differ on some fronts, but they share the key characteristics of being excellent stewards of capital for the end investors. Namely: a skilled investment team, a robust investment and oversight process, reasonably low fees, and more. While these plans exemplify many of what Morningstar considers as best practices, there are many other plans we rate that investors can explore. Depending on personal circumstances and preferences, a thoughtful investor can still settle on a different plan.

You can learn more about 529 college savings plans and how to start saving in our 529 guide. Movers and Shakers in Our 529 RatingsAt the overall plan level, 529 ratings moves were modest\u2014two downgrades and six upgrades\u2014with a few notable themes across the underlying pillars. Vanguard-managed plans that employ an age-based structure experienced Process rating downgrades to Average, as these offerings now feature less attractive traits, such as an aggressive track that has above average duration risk in and near enrollment, and conservative and moderate tracks that derisk relatively early, meaning investors are less likely to keep pace with the rising costs of higher education. Stewardship standards for each state, as reflected in the Parent rating, continue to rise, with elements such as evidence of robust interaction between the state and its investment entity set as a baseline; two states were upgraded and two downgraded within this context. And in good news for 529 investors, fees continue to inch downward. The average fee as of our 2022 review fell to 0.45% from 0.48% in 2021 (prior to 2022, the average fee was calculated across only plans under coverage, but the average fee calculation now includes all 529 plans, regardless of coverage, and provides a more representative context for industry trends). Many plans continue to employ index funds and exchange-traded funds, when possible, improving cost efficiency for investors.In 2022, 34 plans received a recommended rating in the form of Gold, Silver, or Bronze. Morningstar Medalist plans offer investment options that should outperform and exhibit some combination of the following attractive features:A well-researched asset-allocation approachA robust process for selecting underlying investmentsA well-resourced and experienced investment teamStrong, stable, and engaged oversight from the stateLow feesInvestors in these medalist 529 plans should be well-positioned for the future.The remaining 20 plans with Morningstar Analyst Ratings are Neutral or Negative and are dominated by advisor-sold plans, whose high fees detract from their overall ratings. Of the 16 Neutral-rated plans, 11 are advisor-sold, six of which carry Above Average Process ratings, indicating these plans offer well-designed investment options. The compounding impact of high fees, however, can hinder performance and the total amount saved over the long term. Negative-rated plans may exhibit a subpar asset-allocation approach, an unattractive lineup of underlying funds, and\/or high fees that reduce the odds of investor success. Many states offer income tax benefits to 529 participants who invest in their home state\u2019s plan, but these benefits vary widely. Some are generous, offering tax credits on low contributions. For other states, the tax benefit is dependent on the contributors\u2019 marginal state income tax rate and state deduction limits. Morningstar does not factor state tax benefits into its ratings, but 529 plan participants can consider the potential tax benefits of investing in their state\u2019s plan, along with our ratings, as part of their decision-making process.Gold 529 Ratings: Industry Standard SettersIn 2022, two plans merit Analyst Ratings of Gold. The excellent stewardship of the state Parents of the Michigan Education Savings Program and Utah\u2019s my529 result in well-designed, low-cost offerings.     In 2020, the Michigan plan moved to a target enrollment structure, in which participants see a gradual shift to bonds from stocks; this mitigates the risk that comes with equity step-downs during volatile markets (age-based series make larger, more infrequent step-downs). To plan this transition, the treasurer\u2019s office worked closely with its investment manager TIAA-CREF to design the glide path to benefit the average beneficiary in this plan, who typically starts saving at around 5 years old. At the same time, the state pushed for improvements in the underlying lineup and now the plan features highly rated Vanguard, iShares, Schwab, and TIAA-CREF funds. This move also resulted in lower fees for the series, and the plan continues to be among the cheapest in the industry.Utah\u2019s my529 plan is the only plan that has received a Gold medal every year since we debuted our ratings in 2012. Utah moved from an age-based to a target enrollment structure in 2021, and it incorporated insights from participant data and asset-allocation research into this new glide-path design, benefiting set-it-and-forget-it savers. The plan also continues to offer its unique, custom age-based portfolios that allow investors to build their own glide paths using Vanguard and DFA funds. State oversight continues to be topnotch. Instead of hiring an investment manager for the plan, the state employs its own well-resourced and experienced investment team and draws upon a network of experts, including its board, an investment advisory committee comprising institutional investors and advisors, and consultants. Silver 529 Ratings: Standard CarriersAlmost all of the Silver-rated plans have an Above Average or High rating for both People and Process. This indicates that a highly regarded investment team employs a rigorous process regarding glide-path design, asset allocation, manager selection, and risk management to create an offering that is suitable for 529 beneficiaries.There are two new Silver-rated plans this year. Illinois\u2019 Bright Start Direct-Sold College Savings was downgraded to Silver from Gold because of recent turnover in the state treasurer\u2019s office, and the Wisconsin Edvest 529 Plan was upgraded to Silver from Bronze following improvements to the target enrollment lineup and fee cuts.     Bright Start\u2019s partnership between the Illinois treasurer office\u2019s investment professionals and investment advisor Wilshire has long been a source of strength. The state actively manages its age-based series with regular small adjustments to the underlying fund lineup. One ongoing trend is the effort to gradually shift to passive from active funds in more efficient asset classes. In 2021, the state\u2019s director of investment analysis and due diligence was promoted to chief investment officer, and later that year, his sole team member\u2014and replacement\u2014departed. The CIO now works with an interim director (as of August 2022) and a new analyst hired in late 2021 who is new to the industry. These changes lowered the plan\u2019s People rating to Above Average from High and caused an overall downgrade to Silver. Overall, this plan is still a strong option, offering three risk-based tracks, available with either very low-cost index funds or a strong mix of active and passive strategies composed of many Morningstar Medalists.In May 2022, Wisconsin improved its target enrollment series\u2019 underlying fund lineup, swapping in three highly rated Vanguard funds and removing three actively managed TIAA-CREF funds. This change, along with newly negotiated program manager fee cuts, resulted in a large 30% average fee reduction and a Price Pillar upgrade. Wisconsin\u2019s open-architecture approach has become more like those of the Silver-rated direct-sold plans that TIAA-CREF manages for California, Georgia, and Minnesota. As such, we have upgraded this Wisconsin plan to Silver.The Vanguard 529 College Savings Plan, Pennsylvania 529 Investment Plan, and Ohio\u2019s CollegeAdvantage 529 Savings Plan also earn Silvers. Vanguard is the investment manager for these plans, all of which have adopted Vanguard\u2019s new target enrollment structure. MOST Missouri\u2019s 529 Education Plan has not adopted the target enrollment structure but retains its Silver rating because of strong state Parent stewardship and recent fee reductions.Other Silver ratings include plans (offered by Alaska and Maryland) run by a topnotch team at T. Rowe Price. These are favorites among all-active target enrollment series. Silver-rated Oregon College Savings Plan distinguishes itself with a target enrollment series that features a portfolio for every year (most plans offer portfolios every two or three years).Bronze 529 Ratings: Meeting and Sometimes Exceeding StandardsBronze-rated plans tend to have a mix of Average to Above Average ratings across the People, Process, Parent, and Price Pillars. They can still help investors meet their goals, but the range of outcomes is wider than those of Silver- or Gold-rated rivals.     Four plans were upgraded to Bronze from Neutral in 2022. Indiana\u2019s CollegeChoice 529 Direct Savings Plan earned a Process upgrade by improving the diversification of its target enrollment series\u2019 by increasing its exposure to non-U.S. stocks to 35% within the equity sleeve (from 25%) and adding a real estate fund. Other improvements included removing a credit-sensitive bond strategy and dropping average fees by 25%.Fee cuts also elevated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan and Illinois\u2019 Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 College Savings Program to Bronze from Neutral. Iowa trimmed its program management fee this year, making it among the industry\u2019s cheapest. Illinois\u2019 Bright Directions\u2019 average fees for its age-based series are the lowest among advisor-sold plans. In November 2022, the plan will launch a lower-cost index-based series, which will further reduce average fees.Nebraska\u2019s Bloomwell 529 Education Savings Plan earned an upgrade because of increased confidence in its offering, which features two options: a core low-cost index fund track and a socially aware track whose underlying holdings include Morningstar Medalist iShares ESG equity funds and a high-quality bond sleeve.Vanguard plans that continue to use the age-based structure instead of the newer target enrollment structure all saw Process rating downgrades to Average from Above Average. These include North Carolina\u2019s National College Savings Program, MOST Missouri\u2019s 529 Education Plan, Colorado\u2019s CollegeInvest Direct Portfolio College Savings Plan, and New York\u2019s 529 Program (Direct). North Carolina\u2019s and Colorado\u2019s overall ratings remained Bronze, but New York\u2019s fell to Bronze from Silver and Missouri retained its Silver. Vanguard\u2019s age-based offerings have outdated traits such as above-average duration risk in the aggressive track and overly conservative moderate and conservative tracks that remove equity exposure by 17 and 13 years old, respectively.Neutral 529 Ratings: Industry StandardThe list of Neutrals remained consistent. It includes many advisor-sold plans whose layers of fees offset their Above Average Process ratings. New Mexico\u2019s Scholar\u2019s Edge has made adjustments that bring it more in line with evolving industry standards, prompting an upgrade of its rating to Neutral from Negative.     Negative 529 Ratings: Below StandardSeven plans earned Negative ratings in 2021. Four of them stayed Negative in 2022, New Mexico\u2019s Scholar\u2019s Edge moved to Neutral, and two plans were dropped from coverage: Nevada\u2019s SSgA UPromise 529 Plan and USAA 529 Education Savings Plan.     There were some pillar changes among the Negatives. College Access 529 Plan saw a People downgrade to Below Average, as a new firm with fewer resources took over. Virtus provided a home for three members of the team after the SEC disqualified their previous employer Allianz Global Investors from providing advisory services to U.S.-registered funds effective July 2022. This transition hollowed out the plan\u2019s investment team, as it lost access to Allianz\u2019s 80-person global multi-asset outfit.For New Jersey, recent improvements to its direct and advisor-sold age-based series\u2019 underlying fund lineups drove a Parent rating upgrade to Below Average from Low. The new fund lineup also features lower cost strategies, improving New Jersey\u2019s Franklin Templeton 529 College Savings Plan\u2019s Price rating to Above Average from High.Morningstar Analyst Rating InputsWe began rating 529 education savings plans in 2012. Over that period, these tax-advantaged investment options have gained popularity, as assets climbed from $167 billion to over $386 billion as of August 2022. The 529 industry continues to evolve, and in July 2020, we rolled out an enhanced rating methodology, reflecting our updated views on what an industry-standard plan looks like and what aspects of a plan warrant our highest conviction. We evaluate plans based on four key pillars: Process, People, Parent, and Price. Pillar-level research informs our holistic view of plans and results in the Morningstar Analyst Rating for 529 plans.The 2022 ratings (54 plans covered) featured a total of eight upgrades or downgrades, compared with 11 in 2021 (62 plans covered) and 27 in 2020 (61 plans covered). The implementation of our enhanced ratings methodology in 2020 sparked an increased number of upgrades and downgrades compared with prior years, but with this rubric well-exercised for a third year running, our forward-looking ratings were within expectations.","Article Author":"Patricia Oey","Label":"save-for-college","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Nov 2, 2022"},"13":{"Article Title":"The Best Way to Save for College","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1117187\/the-best-way-to-save-for-college","Article Content":"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

Good to see you.Christine Benz: Good to see you, Susan. Key TakeawaysFinding balance is key. It's important to balance college savings alongside other important financial goals, retirement savings being the main one.If you go with your home state's 529 plan, you're typically able to earn a tax break on the contribution.Don't overcomplicate saving for college. Typically 529 plans offer age-based tracks, so you can select the plan that corresponds with your child's age, and those options are really hands-off.Overextending the parents' financial situation in an effort to pay for college is a big mistake that investors make.Dziubinski: One key challenge that many families face is, I have, you know, I want to send my kids to college. I want to save for college, but then I have these other goals like retirement. Any tips for how to think about balancing a variety of different goals when college is one of them.Benz: Balance, is really the keyword. Like so many things in life, it's important to balance college savings alongside other important financial goals, retirement savings being the main one. You have to put retirement savings in the front seat, because if you come up short with your retirement savings, you just simply have fewer levers than you do with college. And another thing I would say on the college front, I think parents might be put off by these incredibly high numbers we see in the realm of what college costs today. I was looking at in-state tuition at public universities--$9,000, $19,000 for out-of-state students at those public universities. Some elite public universities are charging well more than that. And of course private-school tuition has gone through the roof, too, where it's like $38,000 I believe is the average, and many elite private institutions are charging upward of $60,000.Don't be blinded by those really high numbers, recognize that for all but very, very wealthy families, college funding is probably going to come from a variety of sources. So, it might be your personal savings, that might be a component of it, but so might financial aid, so might loans, so might a healthy dose of compromise on the part of your student, and that might entail some work in college. When college comes close, you'll be able to look at the whole toolkit and recognize that for many households, aid, financial aid, merit-based aid will be a big piece of the puzzle. I would urge everyone to read Ron Lieber's great book on this topic. It's called The Price You Pay for College. Really great explainer of how merit-based aid works. Dziubinski: And in your podcast The Long View you actually interviewed Ron about this very topic about a year ago.Benz: We did, and he is a fount of wisdom on this topic of paying for college.Dziubinski: Now there are already different vehicles or tools that parents or family can use to help save for college. What do you recommend? What do you think is the best tool for folks to use. Benz: Well, I would say the basic, main receptacle that people should use is a 529 college savings plan. And there are a few key reasons to look at 529, the big one is tax breaks. So if you go with your home state's plan, you're typically able to earn a tax break on the contribution. As long as the money stays within the 529 plan, you're able to enjoy tax-deferred compounding on your money. And then when the money comes out to pay for college, assuming it's going for qualified college expenses, those withdrawals are also tax-free. You get some nice tax breaks for using a 529 plan. The other big advantage is that for super savers especially, you can get a lot of funds into a 529 plan and there aren't any income limits that would clamp down on how much you can put in there. So, some nice tax benefits and also just a lot of flexibility built in.Dziubinski: How would an investor have a sense of what they should be looking for when they're choosing a 529 plan?Benz: I would say the starting point is to look at your home state's 529 plan. But I would also urge people to take a look at our College Savings Center on Morningstar.com. We've got a map where you can dial in and look at your home state. See what sort of plan is on offer. Our team does these great annual ratings of 529 plans. I believe the next round of ratings is coming out in November. But it's a really nice distillation of how various plans stack up from the standpoint of investment options and fees. And I'm happy to say when we look at the data since we've been covering 529 plans and certainly other entities have been shining a light on this space as well. We've seen fees come down. We've seen investment lineups improve. It's, I think, a fact of life that transparency, shining a light in this space has really helped improve the plans.Dziubinski: And let's talk a little bit about investing those 529 plan assets and the investment choices that you have within a 529 plan. What's your advice there?Benz: My advice is to not overcomplicate this. So, typically 529 plans do offer age-based tracks so you can select the plan that sort of corresponds with your child's age. And the nice thing about that is that those options are really hands-off. So as your child gets closer to college, the plans will typically take risk off the table. And the nice thing is we've seen 529 plans, the age-based plans, really get religion about the importance of becoming more conservative as that matriculation date draws close. We saw some plans get into trouble during the great financial crisis, more plans have cleaned up their act. So, we're seeing more of these age-based plans really sort of being in sync in terms of being thoroughly derisked at the time that college is upon your child.Dziubinski: Lastly Christine, what are some common mistakes that families make when they're saving for college? What are some things that they should try to avoid doing?Benz: I think a big one is overextending the parents' financial situation in an effort to pay for college. I truly get it. I get where parents are coming from in terms of wanting to raid their own coffers to try to make college work. But generally speaking, if you're having to reach into your own Roth IRA or take a home equity loan or take what's called a Parent PLUS loan, which is basically a loan in your own name to pay for your child's education. Those are probably red flags that you are putting your own financial life at jeopardy. I think that's a big risk factor for parents.Dziubinski: Well, Christine, thank you for your time today. It's a really overwhelming topic for parents.Benz: You know.Dziubinski: I know, having just sent our children to college.Benz: Right.Dziubinski: We really appreciate your time and your tips when it comes to this.Benz:Thank you so much, Susan.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

I hope these guidelines will be valuable to others starting their careers or looking for a refresher. Note that while I reference 401(k)s throughout this article, my comments are generally applicable to workers whose employers offer 403(b) or 457 plans instead, which are intended for nonprofit, governmental, and educational institutions.Here are some insights into how 401(k)s work and my top suggestions for getting the most out of yours:What a 401(k) Is, and What It's Not  Although the 401(k) plan wasn't originally designed to be the primary retirement vehicle for U.S. workers, the decline of pension plans since the early 1980s has forced plans like 401(k)s to occupy that role. The key consequence for most new workers is that the heaviest burden of saving for retirement now rests largely on their shoulders. A 401(k) aids in that process by granting you a tax benefit: first by allowing you to defer a portion of your salary before taxes, and second by allowing those savings to compound tax-free. Down the road you will then pay income taxes on the distributions you take. If it's made available by your employer, the newer Roth 401(k) flips that around by taking away that up-front tax benefit but allowing you to take the distributions tax-free later on.Taking the First Step  To borrow from the immortal catchphrase of Star Trek's USS Enterprise Captain Jean-Luc Picard, your first and most important step with respect to a 401(k) is simply to \"engage\" with it by signing up for the plan. When it comes to sending a percentage of your paycheck to your 401(k) account, my message is to start with whatever you can afford, even if it's a small percentage--ideally up to the level of your company match.There are several benefits in doing so. One is simply to develop the habit of investing early in your career, which can become second nature and be built upon as your cash flow increases. Another is the power of compounding interest. Although the dollar amounts trickling into your account early on may seem depressingly small, you can look at any number of models to see how the steady accumulation of even small amounts over very long periods of time reaps great rewards. In the past, we've demonstrated how you could attain a $1 million account balance at age 65 by contributing just a shade over $5,000 per year (including employer matches), if you started at age 22. Delaying your first investment until age 30 would drive up that required annual amount to nearly $9,000. So, it's in your best interest to start early.Learn to Juggle  Many young people are struggling to balance multiple financial goals, including regular expenses, multiple forms of debt payments, and the need to build up an emergency fund. Experts have differing views on how to prioritize managing expenses and debt. My own view is that, to the extent possible, you should try to tackle multiple goals at once.As noted above, if you can start out with making even small contributions to your 401(k), you'll be giving yourself a huge head start. And this sort of financial juggling is something you'll have to do throughout your life. Later on, it may involve saving for an automobile, a house, or a child's tuition, so take advantage of only having to worry about a few things now and establish good habits.If you happen to be working remotely from your parents' house right now while saving on rent, travel, and eating out, there's no time like the present to use that extra income to build up your emergency fund and stash more in your 401(k).Raise the Stakes  You may be wondering how much you should invest in your 401(k). It goes without saying, of course, that the more you can invest, the better.Once you've established that regular contribution habit, there are relatively painless ways to increase your contribution rate over time. One is to sign up for an \"auto-escalation\" feature that many plan providers offer, allowing you to automatically raise your contribution rate by a preset amount on a regular schedule--say by 1% or 2% each year.Another option is to commit to lifting your contribution rate by the amount of your raise each year, which will have no effect on your take-home pay. A more advanced move is to devote a higher share of any bonuses you receive to your 401(k), which will help plump up your account value.Mind the Match Another way to compound the effects of your 401(k) contributions is to take advantage of any employer-matching program that might be available. Matches are typically constructed to mirror a certain percentage of your own contributions, up to a given level. For instance, an employer might contribute 50 cents on the dollar up to a 6% deferral rate.In that scenario, let's say you earn a salary of $60,000 per year. If you elect to contribute at the 6% level, that means you'll put in $3,600 of your own money during the year, plus your employer would contribute an additional $1,800. (Keep in mind that you'll also be reducing your taxes because the pretax contributions will lower the income level that you declare to the IRS.)Two things should be called out here, though. First, there is occasionally a brief waiting period of a few weeks before an employee is eligible to participate in these kinds of plans. Second, while your employer may contribute to your 401(k), there will likely also be something called a vesting schedule in place that determines when you gain full ownership of employer contributions. In many cases you won't have access to 100% of your employer's contributions for a couple of years. (Your own contributions are always yours, even if you switch jobs.) Since this is \"free money\"--or, more accurately, additional compensation from your employer--most advisors recommend contributing at least up to the level of the employer match to get the biggest possible benefit.5 Ways to Keep Investments Simple  We've all heard stories about young people opening up Robinhood accounts and day-trading stocks to their hearts' content. Let me categorically say that your 401(k) is not the place to take unnecessary risks or get overly complicated. As I've written in the past, a simple approach to choosing 401(k) investments is often the best.Here are five methods you can use to do just that:1) Consider Target-Date Funds These funds offer a convenient way to invest money that will grow over time and shift your investments from riskier stocks with potentially higher returns to more secure bonds as you get closer to retirement. It's best for you to pick a vintage year closest to when you'll turn 65.2) Consider Index (Passive) Funds These funds track an entire market (the S&P 500, for example) at once. Consider selecting a broad equity index fund or combining a U.S. and international index to have a wider variety of assets working in your favor.3) Avoid Trendy Areas of the Market Don't choose to invest in a fund just because it's had great recent returns, as research shows that markets tend to be heavily mean-reverting. Remember, in retirement, you're playing the long game.4) View Active Funds With Caution Be wary of actively managed mutual funds, which may have higher fees, more erratic performance, and generally require more attention on your part.5) Stick With Your Plan's Options If your plan offers a brokerage window where you can access stocks, exchange-traded funds, and funds not available through your plan, it's best to pretend it doesn't exist. Lock It Up and Throw Away the Key  I'm exaggerating for the sake of effect here, but I often think that one of the most helpful steps investors can take is to simply forget the passwords to their accounts, depriving them of the ability to constantly check their balances.If you've made smart, strategic choices up front, and you have the benefit of a time horizon of 30 to 40 years, there's really no reason to check in on your account on anything more frequent than an annual basis. The quarterly ups and downs of the stock market are irrelevant to your long-term returns, and checking in during a bear market may induce you to panic and make poor, emotionally driven decisions.During that annual check-in, you should make sure that none of your holdings have performed significantly out of line with your expectations. If you've gone the route of selecting a target-date or index fund, you likely won't have much to do in the way of reallocating. But if you have selected multiple funds from multiple asset classes, you should rebalance if weightings have diverged significantly from your targets. It's also a good time to consider raising your contribution rate if you haven't signed up for an auto-escalation feature.Note that there are ways to gain access to your 401(k) funds prior to retirement, but doing so is generally not recommended. \"Hardship\" withdrawals are allowable if you meet certain criteria defined by the IRS, but you will be subject to taxes and penalties.You can also take a loan from your 401(k), which you then repay through additional contributions to your account at a predetermined (usually variable) interest rate. Just know that depleting your 401(k) assets can do serious damage to your long-term investment plan, so you should only consider it under extreme circumstances. (Here's a more detailed list providing 20 common mistakes that investors make with their 401(k)s).Don't Let Your 401(k) Stress You Out  First jobs are a time of anticipation, excitement, and exploration. Take the time to make the most of your work experience and don't let your 401(k) become a source of stress. Get the big picture right with a low-key approach like I've described above, then devote your energy to building your career skills. In the end, your human capital will drive your earnings growth, and therefore your retirement savings, more than any other action you can take in your 20s.","Article Author":"Josh Charlson","Label":"start-investing","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"May 7, 2021"},"16":{"Article Title":" Roth or Traditional IRA: Which Should You Choose?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/942793\/roth-or-traditional-ira-which-should-you-choose","Article Content":"Editor\u2019s note: A version of this article was initially published on Aug. 26, 2019. This content is part of Morningstar\u2019s Tax and IRA Guide special report.I get this question a lot. Or, rather, it's usually something like, \"Which is better?\"Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs both offer tax-advantaged growth of money. The contribution for both account types for 2021 is $6,000, or $7,000 if over age 50. The biggest difference between the account types comes down to when you pay taxes on the money. With that in mind, here is the first question to ask yourself: Do you think you'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement than you are now?You'll be forgiven if--like me--you don't really know the answer to this question. But here's the conventional wisdom: If you have reason to believe you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you are now, it might be wise to stick with a traditional IRA (in other words, pay taxes on the money later, when your income tax rate will be lower).Conversely, if you are just starting your career and there's a good chance that you will be in a higher tax bracket later in life, a Roth could be a better choice because you'll pay income tax at your current (lower) tax rate. But there are other considerations, too. If you are on a very tight budget and could really use the tax deduction now, a traditional IRA could be the way to go. Here are some additional questions to help you decide.I Think My Tax Bracket Will Be Higher in Retirement If you think your tax bracket will be higher in retirement than it is now, you might lean toward a Roth IRA. But you need to ask yourself a few more questions to see if you qualify.     Source: Morningstar.Of course, if you really want to open a Roth IRA but you aren't eligible to contribute because your income is too high, you can do a backdoor Roth maneuver. With a Roth IRA, you pay tax now. You contribute to a Roth IRA using aftertax money, and you can't deduct the contribution from your taxable income. But when you do withdraw the money in retirement, it's tax-free.Roth IRA contributions are also subject to certain income limits. A single filer and head of household can make a full contribution if your income is below $125,000 and a partial contribution up to $140,000. For married filing jointly, you can make a full contribution if your income is less than $198,000, and a partial contribution up to $208,000.You can withdraw contributions you made to your Roth IRA anytime, tax- and penalty-free. However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties if you withdraw the earnings in your Roth IRA prior to age 59 1\/2. If you are 59 1\/2 or older but haven't had the account for more than five years, your earnings may be subject to taxes but not penalties.Unlike a traditional IRA, you aren't required to take withdrawals after age 72.I Think My Tax Bracket Will Be Lower in Retirement If you think your tax bracket will probably be lower when you're in retirement than it is now, a traditional deductible IRA might serve you better. But there are some considerations with that, too:     Source: Morningstar.With a traditional IRA, you pay tax later. When you contribute to a traditional IRA, if your income is below certain limits, you may be eligible to deduct the contribution from your adjusted gross income, which means you won't pay tax on it now. Beginning at age 59 1\/2, you can withdraw money from your traditional IRA; at that time, you will pay income taxes on the amount withdrawn.For single filers who are covered by a company retirement plan, you can deduct the full contribution if your modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, is below $66,000, and a partial deduction up to $76,000 ($105,000 and $125,000 for married filing jointly). If your spouse is covered by a retirement plan but you are not, the deduction is phased out between $198,000 and $208,000. If neither you nor your spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you are eligible to take the full deduction.If you withdraw the money before you turn 59 1\/2, you may be subject to a 10% penalty on the withdrawal.Beginning at age 72, you will be required to take taxable withdrawals from your account or you will be subject to a penalty.I Have No Idea What My Tax Bracket Will Be When I Retire! If you don\u2019t know what the future holds--and many people fall into this category!--it\u2019s a tax-savvy idea to split the difference. Contribute to both account types if you can. If you do, you will have the freedom to choose whether you pay taxes on your income in retirement or not.","Article Author":"Karen Wallace","Label":"start-investing","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Feb 2, 2021"},"17":{"Article Title":" What Is an HSA?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/965982\/what-is-an-hsa","Article Content":"A health savings account offers powerful tax benefits that stretch your healthcare dollars further. You contribute pretax dollars to the account, and your invested money grows tax-free. You can also withdraw money tax-free if you use it for qualified medical expenses. This triple tax benefit makes HSAs a helpful tool with two roles: You can spend money on current healthcare expenses or invest to cover future ones.You also keep your HSA money until you use it, even if you change employers. This portability differentiates an HSA from a flexible spending arrangement, another account that covers healthcare expenses. You usually lose FSA money if you change employers or have any remaining funds after the plan year (with a few exceptions).Do I qualify for an HSA? You have to be enrolled in a health insurance plan that qualifies as a high-deductible health plan. Your deductible is how much you pay before your insurance kicks in\u2014meaning it starts covering part or all of each eligible healthcare expense. For 2022, a high deductible is at least $1,400 for a self-only insurance plan and $2,800 for a family plan. (Note that the IRS regularly adjusts these figures upward for inflation.) Your health insurance plan's out-of-pocket maximum also cannot exceed $7,050 (or $14,100 for family coverage). You also cannot be a dependent on a tax return, enrolled in Medicare, or enrolled in another health insurance plan (unless permitted under other health coverage).What is the maximum HSA contribution for 2022? In 2022, you and your employer can contribute to your HSA, but combined contributions must be at or below $3,650 for a self-only insurance plan and $7,300 for a family plan. If you're over age 55, you can contribute $1,000 more each year.What can I buy with HSA money? You can spend HSA dollars on qualified medical expenses, which generally include dental, vision, and prescription costs. (You can see a full list of qualified medical expenses on the IRS website.) You'll pay a steep 20% penalty and regular income tax on HSA withdrawals used for nonqualified medical expenses, so try contacting your doctor's office if you're unclear whether a healthcare expense qualifies. Where should I open my HSA (and does it impact how I contribute)? If your employer sponsors an HSA that qualifies as a section 125 cafeteria plan, you may want to start your search there. If you elect to defer part of your pretax salary into the employer-sponsored HSA, these contributions (and any employer match) are not subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes. You won't reap this additional tax benefit by contributing aftertax dollars to your HSA (though you can still deduct the contributions from your taxable income when filing income taxes).You might also receive some extra benefits from an employer-sponsored HSA. Your employer might contribute money to your HSA (though you can transfer any funds into another HSA, as Morningstar's director of personal finance Christine Benz has explained). Additionally, some employers cover the HSA fees that you'd pay if you opened the HSA on your own.If your employer doesn\u2019t sponsor an account, you can use Morningstar Research to find the best HSAs. Our analysts rate HSAs on various criteria including fees, interest rates, and investment quality\u2014depending on whether you use the account for spending or investing. How should I use my HSA? Many people use their HSAs as spending vehicles\u2014in other words, they use their HSAs to pay for qualifying medical expenses.Others, however, also use their HSAs as investment vehicles if they do not need to use their HSAs to cover medical expenses or if they have more money in their HSAs than they need each year to cover medical costs. If you plan to spend and invest with your HSA, consider keeping at least your deductible amount (or even your maximum-out-of-pocket amount) in cash to cover expenses and invest the rest.Are there any other ways that I can use an HSA? You can use HSA funds in these other ways:As a retirement account: Benz notes that after age 65, you can withdraw HSA money for any purpose and avoid the 20% tax penalty. However, you'll pay regular income tax on withdrawals for nonqualified medical expenses.To pay insurance premiums under COBRA: You generally can\u2019t use HSA money to cover an insurance premium or regular payments for an insurance policy. However, if you lose your job and you keep your insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act\u2019s (COBRA) continuation coverage, you can pay the premium with HSA funds. Using tax-advantaged HSA dollars to pay COBRA premiums is a helpful benefit, because COBRA enrollees are often responsible for paying the entire premium.","Article Author":"Michael Schramm","Label":"start-investing","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Sep 28, 2021"},"18":{"Article Title":" What Does It Take to Have a $1 Million 401(k)?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/878897\/what-does-it-take-to-have-a-1-million-401k","Article Content":"Editor's note: This article originally ran on Sep. 5, 2019. It\u2019s since been updated to reflect new data.Let's say your goal is to save a million dollars by the time you retire. For many people, that sounds like a Herculean task.What are you picturing right now? If you are imagining squirreling away money for decades and holding it in cash (which has returned 0.4% after inflation* over the past 90 years), you would need to sock away a lot of money to get to a million. And along the way, your budget could be really tight. Change your mental picture. Instead, invest in your 401(k) (or another retirement savings account) with the goal of having a million dollars in 30 to 40 years. Although it may sound like it's just semantics, it's actually much easier--especially if you start saving early--to let your investments do as much heavy lifting as possible.What Does It Take? You can contribute up to $19,500 to a 401(k) in 2021. But the good news is that you don't have to save anywhere near that much per year if your goal is to have a million dollars at retirement age (65), provided you start early. The earlier you start investing, the longer your investment will compound (your money will grow exponentially). You can do the math yourself if you have a financial calculator, but in case you don't (or you don't have it handy), here's an example of a 25-year-old who has not yet begun saving.     What about that market rate of return? How do I know what stocks will return over the next 40 years? The truth is I don't, and neither does anyone else. If we did know, we would know exactly how much we need to save to reach our goal. But since we don't, we will make educated guesses instead.Here's how I came up with 7%. Over the past 90 years, stocks (as benchmarked by the S&P 500) have returned about 10% per year on average. Adjusted for inflation (which is referred to as the \"real\" return), stocks have gained around 7% per year on average. Does that mean the S&P 500 will earn around 7% after inflation in every year going forward? Of course not--this is just the smoothed-out, average annual return over the past 90 years. Importantly, there is just no accurate way to guess what stocks will do over short-term periods. Over a multidecade period, though, 7% per year is as reasonable an estimate as any. Again, though, there are no guarantees. If you want to be more conservative in your estimate, you can use 6% or 5% as the return for stocks. The result of lowering the growth rate will be that the recommended savings amount rises: In other words, the market won't do as much heavy lifting and you will have to save more. The downside of saving more in the present is that you may have to keep a pretty tight budget, which can be challenging. The upside, obviously, is that you'll have more money saved.Don't forget: Part of your contribution might come from your employer in the form of a company match. Let's say your employer matches the first 5% of your 401(k) contribution at $0.50 on the dollar. That means that if you save at least 5% of your paycheck ($2,000 if your base salary is $40,000), your employer will kick in $1,000. So that means that you only have to save $4,000 per year (10% of your salary) to get into the ballpark you want to be in.Is a Million Going to Be Enough? Now that we've figured out how to save a million dollars, we should ask ourselves if that's even an appropriate target. It's a considerable amount of money and it's a lot more than many people have when it comes time to retire. But if you have many decades until retirement, inflation takes a toll and you might find that a million dollars just isn't a whole lot of money. The goal in retirement savings and drawdown is to maintain your current lifestyle, plus or minus some expenses--maybe more travel spending but less money required for commuting and new clothing. Many people focus on replacing 80% of their preretirement paycheck. Remember, too, that Social Security will provide some income in retirement. Also--and this is something that people sometimes forget--you still have some earning power in retirement, especially if you maintain a modest allocation to stocks in your portfolio.For that reason, it's recommended that you base your savings goal on your household's anticipated cash flow needs rather than on an arbitrary number. For example, Fidelity periodically releases recommended age-based savings benchmarks expressed in terms of multiples of salary (see this article in Fidelity Viewpoints).     These savings \"guideposts\" are Fidelity's, not Morningstar's. I think they they are pretty decent benchmarks. The problem with homing in on a dollar amount is that it might be a lot more or a lot less than you will need in retirement, depending on your current salary and lifestyle.Saving a considerable amount for your retirement isn't impossible. It can be difficult, of course--especially in the early stages of a career when incomes tend to be lower. But hopefully you can afford to sock away $100 to $200 per paycheck. Though for some it may be out of reach, for others it may be more achievable than they thought.* To find rate of return for cash, I used the compound annual growth rate of a T Bill over the period from 1928-2018 (3.4%). (A T Bill is debt instrument backed by the U.S. Treasury that has a maturity of less than one year.)

As such, we think it's important to understand a company's fundamentals before purchasing its shares.Our approach to stock investing boils down to three basics: having an intimate knowledge of the company's sustainable competitive advantages, determining what its shares are worth, and then only buying the stock when there's a significant margin of safety in doing so.Let's unpack that a bit. We encapsulate our opinion of a company's competitive advantages in the Morningstar Economic Moat Rating. From our perspective, these are the types of companies that are able to effectively fend off competitors and earn high returns on capital for years to come. A company whose competitive advantages we expect to last more than 20 years has a wide moat; one that can fend off their rivals for 10 years has a narrow moat; while a firm with either no advantage or one that we think will quickly dissipate has no moat.Our fair value estimates are our take on what we think a company's shares are worth. We look beyond fleeting metrics, such as a company's recent earnings or any stock price momentum. Rather, we calculate fair value estimates based on how much cash we think a company will generate in the future. Our fair value uncertainty rating--depicted as low, medium, high, very high, or extreme--depicts the level of uncertainty around our fair values estimate, based on things like a company's sales predictability, operating and financial leverage, and exposure to contingent events.Lastly, the Morningstar Rating for stocks indicates whether a stock is undervalued (4 or 5 stars), fairly valued (3 stars), or overvalued (1 and 2 stars) based on where a stock's market price is relative to our fair value estimate, adjusted for uncertainty. This guide takes a deeper dive into our process for evaluating and rating stocks and provides useful insight into how to make the most of our company reports.How to Read a Morningstar Stock Analyst ReportWhat Makes a Moat?The Morningstar Economic Moat RatingThe Morningstar Fair Value Estimate Why Do Stocks' Fair Value Estimates Change?The Morningstar Rating for StocksThe Morningstar Rating for Stocks Do's and Don'tsHow to Use Morningstar Ratings to Find Quality StocksQuick Definitions: Key Morningstar Terms Economic MoatFair Value EstimateFair Value UncertaintyMorningstar Rating for Stocks","Article Author":"Susan Dziubinski","Label":"start-investing","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Jun 15, 2020"},"20":{"Article Title":" Key Factors for Evaluating Mutual Funds    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/990067\/key-factors-for-evaluating-mutual-funds","Article Content":"If you're currently saving for retirement--or looking to get started saving--you might be wondering how to assess the quality of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.There are a few main areas that form the foundation of Morningstar manager research analysts' evaluations of funds, known as the Morningstar Medalist ratings. We'll walk you through all these Pillars--Process, People, and Parent--and we'll show you a quick and easy tool you can use to see how your fund picks work together in a portfolio.How Has the Fund Performed? Performance may be the first thing many people look at when evaluating a fund, but it's not the most important consideration and it certainly shouldn't be the only one. For one thing, a fund's trailing returns won't tell you much about what role a fund could play in a portfolio. And they also won't tell you too much about how the fund will perform in the future. By clicking on \"expanded view\" on the Performance tab, you can take a closer look at how a fund has performed during different market conditions. The Performance chart also helps you put returns into context by showing performance relative to both a benchmark index and Morningstar Category peers, which are other funds that invest in a similar way.You can find more helpful information on a fund's Risk tab. A fund's Morningstar Risk score can tell you how volatile a fund's returns have been relative to category peers. (A fund must have three years of performance history in order to receive a Risk score.) The score assesses the variations in a fund's monthly returns (with an emphasis on downside variations--the ones that keep investors up at night) in comparison to similar funds. The greater the variation, the larger the Risk score.You can pair a fund\u2019s Risk score with its Morningstar Return score, which is an assessment of the fund's excess return compared with category peers. (Again, funds with less than three years of performance history do not receive a Return score.) Funds with Low Risk scores and High Return scores have earned higher returns than peers while taking on much less risk. You can find a visual representation of how a fund's Risk and Return scores compare to peers on the Risk tab.     What Is the Strategy, and How Well Have the Managers Executed It? Morningstar analysts evaluate a fund's performance in the context of its strategy, and you should, too. When you select a fund, it's important to understand how it invests and what type of performance profile you can expect from it. When you look at the fund's past performance, see if it jibes with what you would expect from the fund's stated objective.For example, you would expect an aggressive growth fund to outperform in strongly rising, growth-favored markets. You would expect a fund that plies a defensive strategy, either by investing in stocks with a more-defensive profile or by allocating a portion of assets to bonds or less-volatile asset classes, to protect capital better during market sell-offs. But that defensive fund might look pretty dull in red-hot markets, and that growth fund probably looks abysmal when stocks take a nosedive. Understanding how funds invest and behave in different markets, as well as the different roles they play in a diversified portfolio, will help you maximize your wealth-building potential. (More on that later.)Morningstar analysts thoroughly evaluate a fund's strategy when they rate a fund's Process, which is one of the three Pillars, along with People and Parent, that determine a fund's Medalist Rating. The ratings, which are a feature of Premium Membership, are forward-looking and express how much conviction our analysts have in a fund's or ETF's ability to outperform its peers in the future. Analysts give higher ratings to funds whose performance objective and investment process (for security selection, risk management, and portfolio construction) are sensible, clearly defined, and repeatable. The process must also have be implemented effectively; in this context, trailing returns can be informative. Who's Running the Fund? You should also give consideration to the team running a fund. This includes not only the managers' tenure and demonstrated skill in executing the strategy, but the analyst team supporting those managers.We've found that mutual funds and ETFs run by high-quality management teams tend to outperform their benchmark and peers. To evaluate an investment\u2019s management team (the People rating), Morningstar analysts assess the fund managers\u2019 and analysts\u2019 experience and ability; their workload; and the depth of direct and indirect resources that support them.Analysts consider other factors, too, such as whether fund managers invest alongside investors and whether their pay incentives are aligned with investors\u2019 interests. Prospective investors can check publicly available SEC filings to see how much each fund manager has invested in the fund; this is a way to ascertain whether the managers' interests are truly aligned with shareholders'.The parent fund company's behavior also matters. Morningstar analysts ask a lot of questions to determine whether a fund company is a good steward of investor capital (the Parent rating). For example, is the fund firm dominated by a sales culture or an investment culture? Does the company often launch funds in hot-performing sectors of the market, whether or not they have demonstrated investment expertise in the style? Does the fund company have a history of closing strategies after a periods of strong returns and frothy inflows? Fund closures can be a sign of a shareholder-friendly fund parent--one that doesn't prioritize asset-gathering at the cost of sacrificing current shareholders' future returns.How Much Does It Cost? Price is one of the best predictors of a fund's future returns. That's because a fund's costs come right off the top of its total return.As explained in this article, you can use Morningstar to check a fund's price and see whether it's a good deal relative to other funds that invest the same way.

","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/808120\/what-are-target-date-funds","Article Content":"Editor\u2019s note: A version of this article ran on May 7, 2021.There are so many options on a retirement savings plan menu that it's hard to know what to choose. But selecting good investments is only one part: Investors should also pay attention to overall portfolio diversification and not take on too much risk by being too heavily concentrated in any one area.How the investments correlate with one another is another consideration. Modern portfolio theory says that investors can maximize their return potential and reduce the risk of losses by combining investments in asset classes that are not perfectly correlated with one another. A combination of investments like this is likely to do reasonably well in a variety of environments, because as one asset is falling, another is likely rising. Once an optimal asset allocation is established, it's often advisable to rebalance back to the target allocations every so often and to reduce exposure to risky assets like stocks and stock funds as retirement approaches. Whereas early on investors are focused on growing their wealth, as they approach retirement the focus shifts to preserving it.These tasks are not impossible; certainly many investors manage their own portfolios and do it quite well. But there are a great many savers who would prefer to outsource the tasks of portfolio assembly, rebalancing, and gradually making their asset allocation more conservative. That's where target-date funds come in: They do all this for you.What Is a Target-Date Fund? A target-date fund is made up of other funds. The underlying funds offer diversified exposure to a mix of asset classes such as stocks (large caps as well as small\/mid-caps), foreign stocks, bonds, foreign bonds, and maybe a small portion of cashlike securities. They are designed to be held throughout a person's lifetime, and the asset mix shifts dynamically, becoming less risky over a person's working career and into retirement. These funds achieve this by rebalancing portfolios over time to become less focused on growth (lowering their allocation to stocks) and more focused on preservation (raising their allocation to bonds) as the fund approaches and passes the target date. (The year in the fund's name corresponds approximately to the investor's retirement date.) Target-date funds have become very popular: Investors had more than $3 trillion in target-date strategies by the end of 2021. One reason is that the Department of Labor's Pension Protection Act of 2006 designated these funds as a Qualified Default Investment Alternative within 401(k) retirement plans, which are investment vehicles into which plan sponsors are allowed to place participants who do not make their own investment election.But their popularity also owes to their relative ease of ownership--they are truly hands-off investments that offer a diversified portfolio of building blocks with professionally managed allocations and automatic adjustments.What to Look For Although you may be limited by your plan choices, there are many characteristics that Morningstar pays attention to when we evaluate target-date funds. Here are some things to look for. Low fees Unlike buying a luxury car, paying a high price for an investment doesn't guarantee you a better ride. It's important to pay attention to the overall cost of the target-date fund. Some providers layer on fees, and the resulting price tag represents not only the blended costs of the underlying funds but also a layer of management fees that the advisor charges to implement the asset-allocation glide path. Look for low fees. (Note that the funds that are closer to their target retirement date will tend to be less expensive overall than later-dated options because their asset mix starts to tilt away from higher-priced equity fare and toward lower-priced fixed-income options.)For instance, Silver-rated Vanguard Target Retirement Series charges just 0.08%. The portfolio is made up of low-cost index funds, and Vanguard does not charge a management fee to handle the dynamic asset-allocation piece for investors. Also, target-date funds built around index funds tend to be cheaper than those built around actively managed funds. According to Morningstar's target-date landscape report, the average asset-weighted expense ratio for target-date funds was 0.34% at the end of 2021.Asset mix that suits risk tolerance Some target-date funds invest more aggressively than others. Funds in the BlackRock LifePath Index series have an equity allocation approaching 97% for investors targeting retirement around 2060, while JPMorgan SmartRetirement has an equity stake of 85%--nearly 12 percentage points lower--for its similarly dated fund.Investors can also drill down to the underlying exposure to foreign stocks (maybe your risk tolerance doesn't jibe with having a big stake in emerging markets, for instance) or fixed income (perhaps you would prefer to avoid high-yield bonds).Check out the Portfolio tab on Morningstar.com's fund quote pages. There you will find statistics about the fund's portfolio.A glide path that makes sense The rate at which a target-date fund adjusts its allocations to stocks and fixed income over time is known as its glide path. Check to see how the fund invests over time and ramps down its equity exposure as retirement nears. Some invest more heavily in stocks throughout the life of the fund in the belief that a higher equity position--and the higher returns that typically come along with stocks--is necessary to ensure that investors don't outlive their savings.Morningstar analysts can help you evaluate a fund's glide path and allocation. The Fund Analysis section contains a thorough evaluation of the fund's merits and drawbacks and our analysts' overall rating. (The Fund Analysis section and Morningstar Analyst Rating are features of Premium Membership. You can sign up here for a free trial.)The Fund Analysis is divided into six sections. Each analysis begins with a Summary, in which the analyst provides a summary of their overall opinion, which often discusses the most important or decisive factors leading to the fund's overall rating. In the sections that follow, the analyst provides an evaluation of how well a fund scores in three fundamental areas (or Pillars): Process, People, and Parent. A fund's overall rating is heavily influenced by the qualitative scores our analysts assign to these three pillars.One-Size-Fits-Most For many investors, target-date funds make a lot of sense, but they may not work for everyone. Outside of initially picking the fund, they don't offer investors control over their investment or allocation choices. Also, by choosing a target-date vehicle, investors are limited to a given fund family's funds; most target-date funds use their own underlying funds to build portfolios. The drawback of that is that few fund companies offer best-of-breed funds across all asset classes.In addition, they are intended to be used on their own. If satellite holdings are added--perhaps to add exposure to market sectors not represented in the target-date fund's portfolio--investors must take on part of the rebalancing task by recalculating the asset allocation of the entire retirement portfolio to make sure it's in line with targets. (Morningstar.com's Portfolio Instant X-Ray tool can help.)Those caveats aside, target-date funds offer a great proposition for most retirement savers. They are no doubt the easiest path to setting up a diversified portfolio and maintaining a sensible asset allocation for decades.","Article Author":"Karen Wallace","Label":"start-investing","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Mar 11, 2022"},"22":{"Article Title":" What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/952709\/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund","Article Content":"Editor's note: This article originally ran on Nov. 19, 2020. It\u2019s since been updated to reflect new data.ETFs (or exchange-traded funds) are hybrid investment vehicles that can offer relatively low-cost and tax-efficient exposure to a variety of asset classes and investment strategies. Like traditional mutual funds, most ETFs invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs trade on a stock exchange.The majority of ETFs are passively managed, which means they track an index. That said, a growing minority of them are actively managed. Irrespective of whether they are tracking an index or delivering an active strategy, ETFs tend to have lower annual expenses relative to mutual funds. That said, because they trade like stocks, investors should account for transaction costs (commissions, bid-ask spreads, and so on). ETFs are often lauded for their tax efficiency compared with traditional mutual funds. There are two main reasons ETFs are often more tax-efficient. First, most ETFs are index funds. And index funds, especially large-cap index funds or total-market index funds that are weighted by market cap, have fairly low turnover. Low turnover means fewer opportunities to realize gains when securities are sold from the portfolio. ETFs' structure is the second, more important driver of their tax efficiency. ETF shares are created and destroyed via in-kind transactions between ETFs' sponsors and a special kind of market maker known as an authorized participant. As such, ETFs tend not to have to directly sell positions from their portfolios to meet redemptions, which protects investors from taxable capital gains distributions.Investors should be aware that tax-efficient doesn't mean tax-free, though. The primary benefit of ETFs from a tax perspective is that they can allow investors to defer the realization of capital gains taxes. Investors in ETFs will still pay taxes on regular distributions of income, and they will also pay capital gains taxes when they sell an ETF for more than they paid for it. Also, some ETFs will distribute capital gains, though they tend to be less frequent and of lesser magnitude than those their mutual fund counterparts generate.How to Find the Best ETFs Morningstar Analyst Ratings can help you identify topnotch ETFs in nearly every asset class. Our analysts carefully evaluate exchange-traded funds, paying particular attention to the fund's process; they tend to favor ETFs that are very broadly diversified, low-cost, and sponsored by solid parent firms. The ETFs that attract the most investor dollars tend to be in \"core\" categories such as large-cap equity, foreign large-cap equity, and intermediate-term core bond, which are often used as the main building blocks of investors' portfolios. Encouragingly, many of the 10 largest ETFs by net assets are among those rated highly by Morningstar analysts for their broad diversification, low fees, and demonstrated ability to efficiently track a well-constructed index.     We assign positive (Morningstar Medalist) ratings to ETFs that we believe can outperform the median fund in the Morningstar Category, after fees. The ETFs we expect to outperform by the widest margin are rated Gold; our next-highest conviction picks are rated Silver, followed by Bronze.We hold ETFs that fall under the heading of strategic- or smart-beta to a different (higher) standard. At Morningstar, we think of strategic-beta ETFs as index funds that make active bets: They are linked to indexes that focus on one or more factors--such as value, momentum, or low volatility, in an effort to improve their returns or alter their risk profiles relative to traditional market benchmarks. Because of this, we require strategic-beta funds to surpass a tougher hurdle: They need to convince us they can beat the category index after fees (not the median fund in the category). Our assessment of process is the most important consideration behind the rating for these funds.We also assign Analyst Ratings to a number of actively managed ETFs. We put these funds through the same paces as we do actively managed mutual funds, while paying close attention to how the potential constraints of delivering an active strategy in the ETF format might affect the management team's process.

On paper, Buffett\u2019s investment strategy is pretty simple:Buy businesses, not stocks. In other words, think like a business owner, not someone who owns a piece of paper (or these days, a digital trade confirmation).Look for companies with competitive advantages that can be maintained, or economic moats. Firms that can successfully fend off competitors have a better chance of increasing intrinsic value over time.Focus on long-term intrinsic value, not short-term earnings. What matters is how much cash a company can generate for its owners in the future. Therefore, value companies using a discounted cash flow analysis.Demand a margin of safety. Future cash flows are, by their nature, uncertain. To compensate for that uncertainty, always buy companies for less than their intrinsic values.Be patient. Investing isn\u2019t about instant gratification; it\u2019s about long-term success.Of course, what's simple in theory can be less so in execution.If you want to emulate Buffett\u2019s investment strategy, we\u2019ve compiled some of Morningstar\u2019s work on the approach he and partner Charlie Munger have pursued at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B.

If you have years or decades to invest, as many beginning investors do, you can invest in stocks and see your dollars multiply over the time period.But you might wonder whether you should buy individual stocks or an equity fund, which is a basket of stocks. While it doesn\u2019t have to be an either\/or decision forever, beginning investors are often better starting with funds because they offer some conveniences. We take a closer look at why and give some advice on how to choose a fund.Diversification Is a Fund's Main Benefit One risk of holding only a handful of individual stocks is that if a few failed, it could have a big impact on your overall return. This is called unsystematic or business risk; it's the chance that company-specific issues like poor management or lawsuits could cause a stock's price to permanently plummet. The good news is that you can eliminate this risk by owning many companies, which is called diversifying. When you diversify by owning many stocks, the performance of the overall portfolio would be only minimally affected by a few poor performers. As most funds have dozens (or hundreds) of holdings, you can diversify away unsystematic risk with just one fund in many cases. For many beginning investors, that shortcut is a huge advantage compared with buying and researching individual stocks.You might also benefit from other diversification shortcuts that funds offer. There are also risks if you concentrate your portfolio in a specific sector or geography because that area may perform poorly and hamper your returns. With mutual funds, the portfolio often contains companies across sectors; if you add an international fund or two, you can easily own companies from around the globe (this also spreads your bets across more currencies).However, diversification comes with a drawback: It lessens the impact of high-performing stocks, which some investors might seek. But as Alex Bryan discusses, it\u2019s difficult to beat the market, and you face even more difficulty if you\u2019re just learning the ropes. Many beginners will find that diversification\u2019s downside protection outweighs losing out on the small chance of sky-high returns. Using Morningstar Research to Choose a Fund While a fund can offer shortcuts, beginning investors must still perform meaningful due diligence to find the right pick(s).If you're looking for some help, you can use Morningstar's research. We assign many funds a Morningstar Analyst Rating, which expresses our confidence in whether a fund can beat or mirror its benchmark's return going forward depending on whether it's an active or passive strategy (more on that difference later). For funds that our analysts like, we assign Bronze, Silver, and Gold medalist ratings, with Gold expressing our highest level of conviction.  Evaluating and Choosing the Right Fund(s) for You You might notice that Morningstar awards Medalist ratings to hundreds of funds in many different Morningstar Categories. As a first step, you'll need to determine what type of fund you're looking for. One area of the market investors often use for core stock exposure is the large-cap blend category, which contains large, multinational businesses across many different market sectors. For core foreign-stock exposure, many investors opt for funds in the foreign-stock large-blend categories. Another option is a target-date fund, which contains various underlying funds that combined can satisfy an investor's diversification needs. You can use Morningstar research to find a topnotch choice in your preferred area(s) of the market. That's because Morningstar analysts rank funds relative to peers in their Morningstar Category, or Morningstar-created peer groups that cluster together similar types of funds. If you choose a Gold-rated U.S. large-blend fund, you know that our analysts have high conviction in that fund relative to other large-blend funds.Once you've zeroed in on a category or two, you\u2019ll need to carefully consider your preferences and circumstances to determine the best fund for your needs. Here are some key considerations:Active or Passive You'll have to decide whether you want a passive or active fund. A passive fund's goal is to replicate the return of a designated market segment, and an active fund seeks to outperform the market segment.Why would an investor choose a fund that won\u2019t beat the market, you might ask? Many active fund managers underperform in the pursuit of beating the market (and active funds tend to charge higher fees), which can make the average return of passive investments appealing. (For more on the decision, see \"What Is Passive Investing?\")Traditional Mutual Fund or ETF You'll also have to decide whether you want a traditional mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund, which is a fund that trades on a stock exchange. ETFs are typically passive investments, which means they track an index.Beginning investors won\u2019t notice many huge differences between traditional mutual funds and ETFs, so they can usually choose either (or a mix of both). One notable difference that Ben Johnson highlights is that ETFs have a tax-efficient structure, so you might prefer an ETF if you\u2019re in a taxable account.Costs You'll want to carefully consider a fund's costs because every penny paid in fees is a penny that's no longer available for you to invest. It's easy to find a fund's costs using Morningstar.com quote pages. Here's how:Enter the ticker (1) of the share class you want to invest in to pull up its Quote page.Look for the fund's expense ratio (2), or the annual fee that covers various costs, including the costs associated with managing the fund and selecting investments; administrative costs; and fees associated with brokers that facilitate the purchase and sale of funds.To put the expense ratio into context, you can also check the fund's Fee Level (3), which compares the fund's fees against those charged by category peers.You can also see whether the fund has a load (4), or sales charge.     Investment Minimum Many mutual funds have an investment minimum (5), which is the least amount of money a fund will accept to establish a new account. Some funds have $0 minimums, while others can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars for share classes that are available to individual investors. (If you're unsure what a share class is, see Karen Wallace's How to Choose Among Fund Share Classes.)If you require a small investment minimum, you do have some options:Some funds have a $0 investment minimum, so you could choose only funds that meet these criteria.You can buy most ETFs for a specified price that's usually a few hundred dollars at most.You can gain access to funds for less than the investment minimum in many employer-sponsored retirement plans, like a 401(k).","Article Author":"Michael Schramm","Label":"start-investing","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"May 21, 2020"},"27":{"Article Title":"How Much Should I Have in My 401(k)?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1129518\/how-much-should-i-have-in-my-401k","Article Content":"If you ask any Morningstar specialist for advice, they\u2019ll tell you to save early and save often. No matter the stage of life and investing you\u2019re in, one thing is for certain: You need to save for retirement.One popular way to do this is by enrolling in your company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan. With this retirement savings vehicle, your contributions aren\u2019t taxed and many companies offer an employee match.How Much Should I Contribute to My 401(k)?Some folks have ambitious retirement goals, from those dedicated to the Financial Independence, Retire Early, or FIRE, movement to those who are aiming to save $1 million in their 401(k). What if you don\u2019t fall into, or anywhere near, those categories? No matter your ambitions, there are still limits to guide your contribution plans.Starting in 2023, here are the new 401(k) contribution limits. (Note: Part of your contribution may also come from your employer if they offer a company match.)Under age 50: $22,50050 and over: $30,000Keep in mind, these are limits\u2014not numbers you have to meet every year. One of the most widely used guidelines for setting and tracking your savings goals is Fidelity\u2019s Age-Based Savings Benchmarks.Let\u2019s break it down:Age: 30, Savings: 1 time your salaryAge: 45, Savings: 4 times your salaryAge: 50, Savings: 6 times your salaryRemember, this is just a guideline, and the specifics will vary depending on the individual. How Much Do I Need in My 401(k) to Retire?If you\u2019re following Fidelity\u2019s benchmark as a guideline, your target is 10 times your salary at 67.

Once you pay off the highest interest-rate debt, move onto the next highest one.Debt snowball: List your debts from smallest to biggest, make minimum payments on all the debts, and throw the extra cash on the smallest balance.

Even finding a starting spot can prove challenging. If you search for an investment term on the Internet, you often end up with an alphabet soup of complex financial terms.A better entry point can be picking up a book by an expert who thoughtfully and sequentially presents and explains financial concepts and investing topics. Resources like these can help you realize that investing doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating or complicated. Here are the best investing books for beginners that are great places to get started.Prefer podcasts? This list has you covered.1. The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing, by Benjamin GrahamBenjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing. He taught Warren Buffett, a modern investing icon. His book lays a framework for evaluating a business\u2019 worth based on financial value, not short-term trading techniques. In his book, Graham defined many important investing concepts such as \u201cmargin of safety,\u201d which is an important input in the Morningstar Rating for stocks. The revised edition includes commentary from The Wall Street Journal's personal-finance columnist Jason Zweig that contextualizes and modernizes the text. With Zweig's commentary on every chapter, the book is north of 500 pages, which is a lot; however, it's a thorough introduction to investing. If getting through means skimming a few chapters, no judgment here.2. A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, by Burton MalkielIf Graham teaches you how to evaluate a business, Burton Malkiel explains why that might not help you. The Princeton economist argues that markets demonstrate efficiency because people are analyzing a company\u2019s value. (Efficiency means a company\u2019s share price reflects its current worth, and its price will change when new information alters a business\u2019 worth.) Malkiel recommends earning the market\u2019s return instead of beating it, which he compellingly argues is good enough. The book was first published in 1973, but updated editions have added contemporary topics. These include exchange-traded funds and investment techniques like smart beta (which Morningstar prefers to call \"strategic beta,\" but I digress).3. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns, by John BogleInvesting icon John Bogle died on Jan. 16, 2019, but he left behind an impressive legacy: He revolutionized the mutual fund industry and was a tireless advocate for investors. He pioneered the index fund, which allowed investors to gain diversified exposure to the stock market at a very low cost, helping them keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets. His book explains why low fees significantly affect returns. It also addresses topics like mean-reversion and tax costs. The text is accessible and shorter than many other investing books, and it includes quotes from many prominent financial figures who support Bogle's claims.4. Morningstar\u2019s 30-Minute Money Solutions: A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your Finances, by Christine BenzEven if you understand investing basics, you might struggle to incorporate them into your personal finances. Executing them in manageable steps can prove even more challenging.That's the beauty of this book. Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance, breaks financial planning down into bite-size chunks that anyone can handle. You start with basics like assessing your net worth and creating an organization system, and you progressively conquer more advanced topics including retirement investing, college savings, and estate planning.If you want to meld investment basics with tangible advice, this book is a great option.5. The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, by Warren BuffettMany consider Warren Buffett to be the best modern investor. He has risen to fame as Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s CEO, a position he\u2019s held for over 50 years. Berkshire Hathaway invests in high-quality businesses with strong growth potential. But Buffett only buys such companies when they\u2019re selling at an attractive margin of safety (hat tip to his mentor, Benjamin Graham). This makes Buffett an extreme stock-picker. Under his reign, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s growth has far surpassed that of the S&P 500, a testament to the success of his approach.Each year, Buffett writes an annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, and all of them are published on the company's website, so anyone can read them. Buffett writes in a straightforward style that is accessible to investors of all skill levels, and he's often very funny to boot. \"The Essays of Warren Buffett\" weaves together Buffett's essays into a sequential, cohesive book.12 Lessons on Money and More From Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger6. The Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing, by Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, and Michael LeBoeufThe advice of The Vanguard Group founder John Bogle is echoed in this comprehensive guide for investors of all experience levels. Packaged into 23 short, light-hearted chapters, this book contains practical advice and explores many aspects of investing, from how to choose the financial lifestyle that fits you to how to balance your emotions to truly master your investments. This guide also provides external resources and other information for readers who want to dive deeper into any of the topics that the longtime Bogleheads cover. A second edition of the book was released in 2014 and includes updated chapters on tax law changes, 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans, and backdoor Roth IRAs.The Bogleheads are investing enthusiasts who honor Bogle and his advice, living by a philosophy to \"emphasize starting early, living below one's means, regular saving, broad diversification, simplicity, and sticking to one's investment plan regardless of market conditions.\" Members actively discuss financial news and theory in a forum.7. I Will Teach You to Be Rich, by Ramit SethiAdvisor and The New York Times best-selling author Ramit Sethi outlines a six-week program for 20- to 35-year-olds to learn the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing. Sethi shares his strategies for eliminating student loans and debt; finding a balance with saving and spending every month; and preparing to purchase a house or car. In the newest edition, he includes stories from readers and insights on the psychology of investing. Sethi strives to demonstrate to investors how to make investments that grow with them and their goals, and how they can spend their money on the things they want without feeling guilty.Our Favorite Best Investing BooksStill have room on your shelf?

Nassim Nicholas Taleb also focuses on randomness. He believes that humans look for or come up with explanations when there aren\u2019t any, emphasizing that sometimes things just simply happen.

These funds\u2014which combine major asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash in a single package\u2014can be a great way to start investing. And even if you already have an established portfolio, an allocation fund could be a logical addition thanks to this fund type\u2019s built-in diversification and simplicity.In this series on portfolio basics, I\u2019ll explain some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are Allocation Funds?Allocation funds invest in more than one asset class. There are two major varieties. First, some allocation funds aim for a risk level that remains relatively static. Morningstar classifies these funds into six main categories, ranging from conservative to aggressive. In practice, these classifications mainly reflect the level of underlying equity exposure, which ranges from about 12%, on average, for conservative-allocation funds to 90% for aggressive-allocation funds.Second, target-date funds provide diversified exposure to stocks, bonds, and cash for investors saving up for retirement on a specific target date. These funds automatically adjust their asset mix to become more conservative as the target date approaches, following a preset glide path. Morningstar currently has several target-date fund categories, with future target dates ranging from 2025 to 2065. There are also several categories with target dates that are in the past (for investors who are already retired) or for funds that are geared toward retirees in general (without a specific target date). As shown in the chart below, target-date funds typically start with heavier equity exposure for investors with many years left until retirement, gradually reducing their level of equity exposure to about 44% of assets at the retirement date. After retirement, the equity allocation continues to gradually decrease.\n\t\t\tAverage Target-Date Asset Mix Over Time\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in Allocation Funds?The main advantage of allocation funds is their simplicity. Because they\u2019re already diversified across asset classes, investors don\u2019t have to cobble together individual funds to put together a diversified portfolio. And in practice, Morningstar\u2019s research on investor returns has consistently found that allocation funds are among the easiest types of funds to use, meaning that investors in allocation funds don\u2019t typically make bad trading decisions and are therefore able to keep a larger portion of returns.Because most allocations include both stocks and bonds, they generally provide middle-of-road risk and returns.As mentioned above, though, their risk level mainly depends on the level of equity exposure. The level of risk spans a wide range. The standard deviation for conservative-allocation funds over the past 10 years, for example, has been just slightly higher than that of bonds. At the other end of the spectrum, aggressive-allocation funds have been nearly as volatile as stocks.\n\t\t\tTrailing 10-Year Risk and Returns: Allocation Funds and Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. Drawdown risk for allocation funds also spans a wide range. As shown in the table below, aggressive-allocation funds have lost as much as 25% over the past 10 years, while conservative-allocation funds had more-limited losses of about 14%. Both returns reflect performance during the bear market that started in January 2022. Even though the market has reversed course since then, none of the categories below had quite made up all of their losses as of Aug. 31, 2023. The reason? While diversifying a portfolio across both stocks and bonds usually helps limit losses, that formula didn\u2019t work in 2022 as rising interest rates and stubbornly high inflation roiled both stocks and bonds.\n\t\t\tOther Risk and Drawdown Stats (Since Sept. 1, 2013)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. How to Invest in Allocation FundsAs the wide range of drawdown risk highlights, it\u2019s important to consider your time horizon and level of risk tolerance before homing in on a specific type of allocation fund. Expenses are another important consideration. Because most allocation funds are funds of funds (meaning they invest in other mutual funds or exchange-traded funds), they have two layers of fees: the expenses for the fund itself, plus the cost of the underlying funds they invest in. For example, Allspring Asset Allocation EAAFX has an expense ratio of 1.04%, but its underlying holdings have additional expenses averaging about 0.57%. Taxes are another thing to consider. Because most allocation funds hold a portion of their portfolios in bonds, they\u2019re typically not the most tax-efficient. This makes them better holdings for a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or IRA, where taxable distributions won\u2019t lead to a higher tax bill. If you\u2019re looking for an allocation fund for a taxable account, consider a tax-managed offering such as Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced VTMFX.Most allocation funds are active to some extent, in the sense that they actively shift their mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes. But funds that invest in passively managed underlying funds will generally have lower costs overall. The most active type of allocation funds\u2014tactical allocation funds\u2014have a terrible track record as a whole. I\u2019d avoid them.When Do Allocation Funds Perform Best?Allocation funds are designed to provide diversification and simplicity, not to maximize returns. As a result, they typically won\u2019t outperform other types of funds in any given year. In risk-adjusted terms, though, allocation funds fare best when both stocks and bonds are generating positive returns. They also perform best during periods when the correlation between stocks and bonds is negative, which reduces risk at the portfolio level. How Long Should I Hold My Investment in An Allocation Fund?The answer to this question depends on the type of allocation fund you\u2019re holding. If you\u2019re using a target-date fund to save up for retirement, you\u2019ll want to hold it at least until the specified target retirement date. Most target-date funds these days are designed to allocate their assets up until the retirement date and beyond, so you can continue holding them even after you\u2019re retired.For other types of allocation funds, Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio framework recommends the minimum holding periods shown in the table below.\n\t\t\tMinimum Recommended Time Horizon for Selected Allocation Categories\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. We came up with these guidelines mainly by looking at the average level of equity exposure within each category. The higher the equity exposure, the greater the chance of incurring a loss over shorter periods. To minimize the odds that an investment is in the red when you need to access the money to fund a goal, it makes sense to plan a longer holding period for allocation funds with higher levels of equity exposure.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Allocation Funds?The answer to this question partly depends on how simple you want to keep your portfolio. If you want to keep things super-simple, allocation funds can be a one-and-done solution, especially if you\u2019re saving for retirement. In fact, Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio framework considered allocation funds to be the only type of fund suitable as a stand-alone holding that makes up the entirety of a portfolio.If you don\u2019t mind a little more complexity, you could dedicate your retirement assets to a single allocation fund (such as a target-date fund) and hold other types of investments (such as dedicated stock and bond funds) in another type of account.What Are the Best Allocation Funds?The table below shows a few highly rated allocation funds in various categories. About half of these are funds of funds that employ index funds as their underlying holdings, while the remainder, including American Funds American Balanced ABALX, Vanguard Wellington VWELX, and Vanguard Wellesley Income VWINX, are actively managed portfolios that invest directly in stocks and bonds.\n\t\t\tA Few Highly Rated Allocation Funds\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. What Funds Pair Well With Allocation Funds?As I mentioned above, you don\u2019t necessarily need to add other funds if you\u2019re already holding an allocation fund. But if you already hold an allocation fund in a tax-deferred account, you could consider adding more specialized funds, such as funds we consider core holdings or building blocks, to a taxable account.Are Allocation Funds a Good Investment?My answer to this question is unequivocal: yes. Allocation funds give you built-in portfolio diversification, thereby solving one of the most difficult parts of investing for many people. Their simplicity also helps investors avoid many of the major pitfalls of building portfolios, such as buying into popular asset classes at the wrong time and failing to choose the right mix of assets for their goals.","Article Author":"Amy Arnott","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Oct 2, 2023"},"31":{"Article Title":"It\u2019s Too Soon to Say the Value Premium Is Dead","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/its-too-soon-say-value-premium-is-dead","Article Content":"The underperformance of U.S. value stocks since the Great Recession has received much attention from the financial media, and prompted at least some investors to conclude that value investing is dead. That has led to papers being written, such as AQR\u2019s May 2020 article, \u201cIs (Systematic) Value Investing Dead?\u201d Because the value premium has been much larger in small stocks than in large, we\u2019ll review the performance of small-value stocks compared with broad market indexes. From 2008 through July 2023, while the S&P 500 returned 9.8% per year, the Fama-French small-value research portfolio returned 8.6%, an underperformance of 1.2 percentage points annually. (Fama-French data is from Ken French\u2019s website.)A Cautionary TaleWe heard the same argument about the death of the value premium in 2000. From 1994 to 1999, the S&P 500 returned 23.6%, annually outperforming the Fama-French small-value research portfolio by 7.2 percentage points. However, the declaration of the death of the value premium was premature. From 2000 to 2007, while the S&P 500 returned 1.7%, the Fama-French small-value research portfolio returned 16.2%, outperforming by 14.5 percentage points annually. Such performance should be a cautionary tale for those declaring the death of value.If the underperformance of the value premium in U.S. stocks since 2008 was a sign that value was dead, we should see similar underperformance outside the U.S. From 2008 through July 2023, the MSCI EAFE Index returned 3.2%, but the Dimensional International Small Cap Value Index returned 5.2%, outperforming by 2.0 percentage points annually. In emerging markets, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 1.7%, the Dimensional Emerging Markets Targeted Value Index returned 4.1%, outperforming by 2.4 percentage points. Thus, outside the U.S., investors who diversified their portfolios to include small-value stocks benefited. We can now examine how a globally diversified small-value-oriented portfolio performed over this 15-year-plus period relative to a market-based portfolio. Roughly allocating to the global market capitalization, we can assign a 50% weighting to U.S. stocks, a 37.5% weighting to non-U.S. developed stocks, and a 12.5% weighting to emerging-markets stocks. This hypothetical, globally diversified, market-based portfolio with those weights would have returned 5.84% annually, underperforming the return of 6.33% of a globally diversified small-value portfolio. And this was perhaps the worst 15-year period for value stocks, ending with the spread in valuations between growth and value stocks being about as wide as they were at the end of the dot-com boom\u2014which foreshadowed the largest outperformance ever for small-value stocks.It\u2019s All About ValuationsWhile all crystal balls are cloudy (we cannot know the future), valuations are the best predictor we have of future returns. And small-value stocks are trading at historically cheap valuations relative to their market counterparts, indicating the likelihood of a large premium going forward. The table below shows the relative valuations of Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF AVUV and Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF AVDV, along with Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF AVES, compared with Vanguard\u2019s broad market index funds, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VTSMX, Vanguard Developed Markets Index VTMGX, and Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index VEIEX.\n\t\t\tValuations of Selected Indexes\n\t\t      The increase in relative valuations has left the value spread at historically high levels. That raises the question: Does the value spread contain information about future returns? To answer that question, Avantis examined the historical data from Dec. 31, 1979, to Dec. 31, 2019. The table below shows the subsequent five-year return difference between value and growth when the valuation spread is below the median and above the median. It makes clear that the valuation spread does contain information about future returns\u2014the future value premium tends to be much higher after periods when the valuation spread is above the median spread\u2014and it is well above the median today.\n\t\t\tMonthly Valuation Spreads\n\t\t      Investor TakeawaysWhile there are no crystal balls, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any strong evidence that the value premium is dead. The poor recent performance has been due to changes in what John Bogle called the \u201cspeculative return\u201d (the change in relative valuations). In support of this idea, consider the following.Let\u2019s go back in time to the end of 2016 and ask if the value premium was dead based on the out-of-sample returns (after the publication of the original Fama-French research on the value premium) over the 25-year period 1992 through 2016. During this period, the Russell 1000 Growth Index returned 8.2% per year, underperforming the Russell 1000 Value Index return of 10.1% per year, or by 1.9 percentage points; and the Russell 2000 Growth Index returned 7.4% per year, underperforming the Russell 2000 Value Index, which returned 11.5% per year, by 4.1 percentage points. The annual average value premium was 4.5%, not much different from the 5.1% premium for the period 1927 through 1991. I don\u2019t think anyone would have declared the value premium dead based on those figures. Yet, just a few years later, we hear a clarion cry that the publication of the Fama-French research and cash flows have killed the value premium. Does anyone seriously believe that 25 years was not enough time for publication of the research to kill the premium, but just a few more years did the trick? And if cash flows had killed the premium, 25 years of them should have been enough to accomplish the task.In addition, as David Blitz demonstrated in his study \u201cAre Exchange-Traded Funds Harvesting Factor Premiums?,\u201d while some ETFs are specifically designed for harvesting factor premiums, such as the size, value, momentum, and low-volatility premiums, other ETFs implicitly go against those factors. Specifically, Blitz found that \u201cfrom a factor investing perspective, smart-beta ETFs tend to provide the right factor exposures, while conventional ETFs tend to be on the other side of the trade with the wrong factor exposures. In other words, these two groups of investors are essentially betting against each other.\u201d Despite what many investors believe, there has not been a massive net inflow into value stocks relative to growth stocks.The Comfortable Path or the Diversified One?The takeaway is that investors face a choice. They can either own a traditional 60% market-like equity\/40% bond portfolio, which has most of its risk (as much as 90% or more depending on the maturity and quality of the bond holdings) concentrated in the single factor of market beta, or they can choose to diversify across as many unique sources of risk and return as they can identify that meet all their established criteria. The first path is the comfortable one in the sense that the portfolio will not cause any tracking error regret\u2014investors won\u2019t be underperforming popular benchmarks that are reported on a daily basis by the financial media. On the other hand, that strategy will likely be highly uncomfortable during periods like 1973-74, 2000-02, and 2008, when the single factor (market beta) that dominates their portfolio\u2019s risk suffers from severe bear markets (and also over long periods, such as the 15-year period 1929-43, the 17-year period 1966-82, and the 13-year period 2000-12, when the S&P 500 underperformed riskless one-month Treasury bills).With that said, failing conventionally is always easier than failing unconventionally (misery loves company). And while based on the historical mean and volatility that the market beta premium should be expected to be negative about 9% of the time over 10-year periods, it seems likely that the odds have risen.According to data from Ken French\u2019s website, from 1927 through 2022 the market beta premium was 8.6%. However, most financial economists expect it to be much smaller going forward, perhaps by half. The reason is that valuations are now much higher\u2014in 1927 the CAPE 10 (cyclically adjusted P\/E ratio) was about 13, whereas today it is more than double that, at about 30. Higher valuations forecast lower future returns. A smaller premium with the same volatility means greater odds of negative returns for U.S. stocks.The second path\u2014diversification\u2014is more likely to lead to successfully achieving goals. However, it does mean having to live with the fact that the portfolio will perform very differently than traditional portfolios, creating the risk of tracking variance regret. In that sense, diversification is not a free lunch. It means living through uncomfortable periods, even long ones. And during periods of failure, it means failing unconventionally, which is much harder to deal with.Given that investors must accept that they will have to live through uncomfortable times on whichever path they choose, it seems logical to pick the one with the highest odds of achieving their goals. And that is choosing the more efficient portfolio\u2014the one that is more diversified across factors that provide exposure to unique sources of risk such as size and value\u2014and saying to oneself, \u201cI don\u2019t care about tracking variance regret because relativism [how you performed relative to some popular index] has no place in investing.\u201dThe opinions expressed are the author\u2019s.

So far, a recession hasn\u2019t materialized. Economic growth has remained strong, with generally positive corporate earnings reports and unemployment still close to historic lows.But even if an economic slowdown isn\u2019t imminent, there will be one eventually. The economy moves in cycles, with periods of economic strength followed by contractions and vice versa. Historically, recessions (generally defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining growth in gross domestic product) have occurred about once every five to 10 years, although the length of time between recessionary periods varies.It\u2019s impossible to predict the timing or severity of a potential recession. And in many cases, it\u2019s often only clear that a recession has happened after the fact, or after the market has already started reacting to slower economic growth. That said, looking at which types of investments have historically fared best during economic downturns can help you limit some of the damage. In this article, I\u2019ll look at investing during a recession from multiple angles, including asset classes, factors, and sectors. (Note: For most of this analysis, I\u2019ll focus on the past four or five most recent recessions because performance data is harder to come by for earlier periods.)Asset ClassesFrom an asset-class perspective, stocks are usually one of the worst places to be during a recession. The reason is simple: Recessions happen when there\u2019s a decline in economic activity, which is usually accompanied by weaker trends in revenue and earnings growth. As companies produce less favorable results, their stock prices usually suffer.As a result, stocks had negative returns in most (but not all) previous recessions dating back to the Great Depression. Some of the worst recent results were during the global financial crisis, when stocks lost an annualized 24% between late 2007 and mid-2009.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Asset Class\n\t\t      On the flip side, bonds have been the best place to be in most previous recessions. Investors often seek shelter in lower-risk assets during periods of economic distress, which helps support bond prices. In addition, the Federal Reserve often cuts interest rates in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, also resulting in higher bond prices. Because of their higher level of sensitivity to interest rates, long-term bonds have historically fared best during recessions, although intermediate-term bonds and cash have also been pretty resilient. Gold has also been a winning asset class during recessionary periods, with positive returns during the eight most recent recessions since 1993. But the yellow metal had a relatively anemic showing during recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s; returns were negative after inflation.Investment StyleI used Morningstar\u2019s U.S. equity fund categories as a proxy for measuring investment style. As shown in the table below, growth stocks have typically held up better during recessionary periods. Companies that have growth-oriented stocks typically have higher earnings growth, cleaner balance sheets, and better profitability\u2014all traits that often help them hold up better than companies with cheaper stock prices during recessionary periods. But growth stocks haven\u2019t fared well during every recessionary period. Growth stocks were hit hard in the tech-stock correction in the early 2000s, which coincided with a brief recessionary period in 2001.From a style perspective, large has generally been better than small during periods of economic weakness. Larger companies tend to have more stable earnings, diversified business operations, and the financial wherewithal to sustain their operations even during recessions. Smaller companies, on the other hand, may depend heavily on a single line of business and often have fewer financial reserves to sustain them during recessions.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Investment Style\n\t\t      Equity FactorsEquity factors are another way of examining the drivers of equity market returns. Factors describe additional characteristics (beyond traditional metrics such as sector, market cap, and value\/growth) that help to explain investment management styles and resulting performance differences. Because equity market returns are generally negative during a recessionary period, no investment factor consistently generated positive returns. In relative terms, the quality factor has historically fared best during periods of economic weakness. Definitions for quality vary, but the MSCI index that I used for this study focuses on stocks that score well on three main metrics: high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Investment Factor\n\t\t      The minimum volatility factor, which is designed to capture stocks with lower betas, volatility, and idiosyncratic risk, has fared second-best, and dividend stocks have also held up relatively well.On the negative side, the value factor has performed the worst during most recessionary periods by a fairly wide margin. (Note: This benchmark for this factor is similar to the value fund categories I discussed above, but it has more extreme performance traits because it has a more pronounced value bent than the typical value fund.) The value factor tends to be overweighted in economically sensitive sectors, such as basic materials, consumer cyclicals, and financials. This is usually a negative, but the early 1980s\u2019 recession\u2014a \u201cstagflation\u201d period that featured sluggish growth, high inflation, and high unemployment rates\u2014was an exception. The value factor posted the best returns during that period.Equity SectorsFrom a sector perspective, healthcare and consumer staples stocks have been the most resilient performers during periods of economic weakness. Consumers can\u2019t easily cut back on prescription drugs, medical devices, or household basics like canned goods and paper towels even if they\u2019re feeling the effects of a weaker economy.On the negative side, energy and infrastructure stocks have been the hardest-hit in recent recessions. Companies in these sectors are acutely sensitive to swings in demand. Financials stocks also can suffer during recessions because of a rising default rate and shrinking net interest margins.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Sector\n\t\t      Technology and communications stocks have a mixed record. During the 1990-91 recession amid the Gulf War and oil supply issues, the communications and technology sectors held up relatively well, and tech leaders such as Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and International Business Machines IBM continued to generate double-digit returns. After surging during most of the 1990s, the tech bubble finally popped in 2000, followed by a brief recession in 2001. Because valuations were still inflated leading up to the recession, the communications and technology sectors suffered the deepest losses.Does the prospect of a looming recession mean you should overhaul your portfolio? No. In fact, making wholesale shifts in portfolio holdings is usually a bad idea. But just like being mentally prepared for winter in Chicago can help longtime residents like me survive the tough season ahead, studying how the market has historically performed can help you set expectations for how your holdings might react if and when the economy weakens.

Instead, it\u2019s their home. Research done by the Survey of Consumer Finances identified primary residences as the largest asset on household balance sheets.The United States is not the only property-crazed nation out there. Back in June, my colleague Mark LaMonica wrote a wonderful article about the Australian housing market and why he was opting out. Reading Mark\u2019s article, I was floored by how much of it resonated with me. Like him, I am fortunate enough to have the means to purchase a home. Like him, I have opted not to.How Much Money Do I Need to Buy a House?Clearly, I\u2019m going against the grain, and I know it. Only 34% of Americans share my lifestyle; many of them are facing a much different financial picture than I am. And I\u2019m a millennial, which means that I am part of the homeownership-killing generation. I hope that by sharing my personal experience that others may find resonance with it, but of course investing is not one-size-fits-all. Take everything I say with a pinch of salt, ideally sprinkled on top of some avocado toast.A few facts about me before I begin. I am 28 years old. I live in Chicago. I am married, but I do not have kids. I am fortunate that my personal liabilities are light. My parents paid for my college education, so I graduated debt-free. I do not own a car, but my husband does. Since I do not have children, I\u2019m not anchored to a particular school district. What\u2019s Your Investment Approach?In his article, Mark outlined his philosophy for financial success. He organizes his decision-making process around his own personal statement of cash flows, keeping fixed costs at a minimum in order to maximize his flexibility.Others put housing in an entirely separate bucket from their human capital and treat it as a luxury good to consume. To these homeowners, a house is worth the money they put into it simply because they like the stability a home provides.Personally, I can\u2019t stop thinking like an investor, even when I probably should. To make matters worse, I tend to think like a value investor, and value investments can fall out of favor for long periods of time.\n\t\t\tValue Investing Can Fall Out of Favor for Long Stretches\n\t\t      Still, I prefer to buy things when they\u2019re cheap. I probably read too much Benjamin Graham at an impressionable age, so now that\u2019s just how I\u2019m wired. You may have a different style, and that\u2019s great. The important thing is to know what it is. Step 1: Define Your Time HorizonThe stalwart Mark has opted to rent for life. I\u2019m not so resolute\u2014I do happen to be in the position of wanting to own a home some day, if only to taste the freedom of getting to choose a paint color other than \u201cFrench Gray.\u201d But when is some day? For any investment decision I make, the time horizon is the starting point of my personal flow chart.Practically, my entry point would be the same as most other urbanites\u2014a starter condo. Let\u2019s say I want to buy a condo at a $500,000 price point, which is slightly below the median price of my area, but I like round numbers. I\u2019ve squirreled enough away for a 20% down payment on that amount, which means I\u2019d borrow $400,000.Based on a casual survey of my older peers, a starter condo would probably last my husband and me about five years. After that, life starts to get in the way\u2014more dogs, more books, more camping gear, all clamoring for a fixed amount of square footage. Eventually, it becomes time to move on. As far as time horizons go, five years is pretty short. The average American spends 13.2 years in their home. Let\u2019s assume I take out a mortgage at an interest rate of 7.6%. Holding home prices constant, by September 2028, I will have notched away an extra 5.3% of equity in my home. (Fear not, we\u2019ll get to return potential in a minute.)\n\t\t\tHome Equity Accrues Slowly in Early Stages of Homeownership\n\t\t      Step 2: Identify the Opportunity SetThis is a highly variable analysis based on a lot of factors that are unique to me. With so many levers to pull, people (read: pushy relatives) tend to probe at the boundaries of your investment universe: What if you put more money down, what if you bought somewhere other than Chicago, what if you bought fewer lattes, what if you stayed in the condo for a few more years\u2014if, if, if.The choices are overwhelming. Know that I\u2019ve run through other scenarios, too. To escape the decision paralysis, today we\u2019re going to just focus on this one investment opportunity. A $500,000 condo within city limits, with 80% leverage and an exit after five years. That\u2019s my opportunity set. It\u2019s probably not yours! Being in the position of even considering a starter condo already makes me wildly fortunate relative to my peers with higher debt burdens. I hope you find this exercise useful anyway.Step 3: Establish Your Risk ToleranceThe third step on my personal flow chart is to establish my risk tolerance, given my time horizon and opportunity set. I am comfortable taking informed risks over long time horizons, like investing heavily in stocks for retirement while I\u2019m still early in my career. But when it comes to shorter-term investing decisions, I am a nervous Nellie. Tail risks aren\u2019t just theory for me: As a middle schooler during the 2008 financial crisis, I watched as my college savings went up in smoke. I need to have a very high degree of confidence because I know firsthand the pain of starting from scratch.My threshold becomes even higher when I consider the mechanics of a home purchase from a lending perspective. In investing, leverage is a powerful tool best used sparingly. The statutory limits for a \u201840 Act mutual fund are 33.3% of overall fund assets. That means that for every $1 million in assets under management, a fund can borrow $333,333 to increase its buying capacity.Meanwhile, everyone considers it normal that homes are purchased with 80% leverage\u2014if not more. For a $1 million home, an investor can borrow $800,000. Yes, the mechanics are very different. But I still think this is kind of wild! For me, it means I need to be extra sure that I\u2019m making the right choice.Step 4: Conduct a Valuation AssessmentNext, I\u2019m going to tally the expenses, which for homes tend to multiply like rabbits. I\u2019ve tried to highlight the most salient ones, but I don\u2019t think this is an exhaustive list by any means.I am probably going to spend at least 1%, or $5,000, a year on maintenance costs. (That expense merely staves off decline; it doesn\u2019t include improvements to increase property value.)I\u2019ll fork over another $2,900 in insurance costs.I live in a major metro, which means HOA fees will run me somewhere around $4,200 annually.I live in Chicago, long an outlier in terms of property taxes. They\u2019re going to set me back $11,000 per year.When I sell my property, I\u2019ll probably pay a \u201cback-end load\u201d in the form of closing fees, which are around 8% of the sale price in my area. For the sake of this analysis, I\u2019ll spread that out over five years so that it is $8,000 per year.Holy smokes. $31,100 is already far more than what I pay in rent each year.Then there\u2019s the interest expenses. Early on in a mortgage, they\u2019re high. If I sell my condo in five years, I will have made a total of $169,547 in mortgage payments. The portion of those payments that go to interest is $148,300, which leaves a paltry $21,582 for principal payments. First-time buyers in this market\u2014I feel your pain.\n\t\t\tIn Early Years, Vast Majority of Monthly Payments Go Toward Interest\n\t\t      Interest expenses aren\u2019t all bad, though, because they generate income tax deductions that can be significant. Everybody\u2019s tax situation is unique, but in the 22% tax bracket (2 times the average household income of Chicago), I could deduct $30,300 in interest payments and $10,000 in property taxes from my income. That\u2019s around $40,300 in tax deductions. Adjusting for the standard deduction that\u2019s available to all taxpayers ($27,700), I could save an extra $2,800 a year. That brings my expenses down to $28,300.If $28,300 was an expense ratio on a mutual fund, it\u2019d be around 5.7% of total net assets. That\u2019s a pretty lousy value proposition when I could just keep my overall costs lower and buy an index fund for free.However, there\u2019s one final sweetener. Unlike an index fund, residential real estate almost always appreciates in value above and beyond home equity, which is why leverage is so normalized.Ilyce Glink: The State of the U.S. Residential Real Estate MarketEven though Chicago has been in population decline since the 1950s, it has still seen the value of its properties go up by about 3.8% since the year 2000. (That return goes up to 5.8% if you venture out into greener pastures like San Francisco and Seattle.) If my home appreciates by the usual amount, it would be worth $601,400 by the time I go to sell it. That means that I would earn $222,982 on my total contributions of $121,582 for a 9.9% internal rate of return. Leverage is neat!\n\t\t\tReturn on Investment Heavily Dependent on Sale Price\n\t\t      That illustration rests on a key assumption, though, one that I don\u2019t hold. I do not assume that the returns that prevailed over the past 23 years are going to hold true over the next five. That\u2019s the real sticking point. If I was going to stay in my home for 10 years, or 13.2, or 30, my calculus would be different. But it\u2019s not.This is the chart that I can\u2019t get out of my head. This is where my internal Benjamin Graham starts whispering in my ear.\n\t\t\t2020s Do Not Obey Linear Relationship Between Mortgage Rates and Home Prices\n\t\t      On the y-axis is the Case-Shiller Index for the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is an aggregation of home price values indexed to the year 2000. On the x-axis, we have the prevailing interest rate, courtesy of the Saint Louis FRED.When interest rates are low, prices are high. When interest rates rise, prices fall. Either way, the monthly payment that Chicagoans make when they enter into a new mortgage obeys the laws of gravity. Those two big dots, way up high in the chart, taunting Newton? Those are the years 2022 and 2023.There\u2019s a simple explanation. Home prices are not responding to interest rates as they normally would because buyers are flush with cash and sellers are scarce. That throws the relationship between interest rates and the prices of Chicago home values out of whack. It does not, however, make them any cheaper.So What?How the housing affordability question gets resolved remains an open question. Interest rates could come down, making a monthly payment more affordable. Even better for first-time buyers, home prices could go down, making for a cheaper entry point. It need not take a global financial crisis to unwind. New construction could ramp up to meet existing demand, altering the mix of Chicago\u2019s housing stock and increasing affordability overall.Could it be the case that it doesn\u2019t get resolved at all, and Americans continue to pay ever-higher prices for a place to live? Aussies like Mark would say they sure can. These events are out of my control. What I can control is my peace of mind.Simply put, for me today, the math ain\u2019t mathing. I have a low degree of confidence that the current return environment for residential real estate in my area will continue to prevail over the next five years, and that makes me unwilling to take a highly leveraged bet on a single asset. I have no qualms about sitting tight and aging out of the starter condo market, at which point the personal economics (not to mention the emotions!) of a home purchase change. I\u2019m a long-term investor, and for the largest asset I will ever own, I don\u2019t mind the idea of being in it for the long haul.Your math may be entirely different from mine. In fact, I hope it is. Everybody\u2019s investment philosophy is as unique as their fingerprint and formed by their lived experience. I sleep better at night knowing that I have listened to the Benjamin Graham inside my head. You probably don\u2019t have a Benjamin Graham inside your head\u2014lucky you. For something as personal as a home, there\u2019s no right or wrong approach. But there is great power in self-awareness.Correction (Sept. 20, 2023): In the calculation of income tax deductions, a previous version of this article didn\u2019t account for the tax benefits of the standard deduction.","Article Author":"Madeline Hume","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Sep 18, 2023"},"35":{"Article Title":"A Crucial Tipping Point for Bond Investors to Keep in Mind","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/crucial-tipping-point-bond-investors-keep-mind","Article Content":"After years of sleepwalking along at modest levels, bond yields and the markets that trade them have jolted awake. Dogged inflation and a surprisingly durable economic recovery have pushed the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by more than 5 percentage points since the current hiking cycle began 18 months ago, plunging bond markets into uncharted waters.\n\t\t\tRate Hike Cycles, 1983-2023\n\t\t      Investors have been caught in the whipsaw. The 10-Year U.S. Treasury Bond, one of the most closely watched bond benchmarks, has seen its yield spike from 1.7% as of February 2022 to 4.1% as of August 2023\u2014the first time it crossed 4% since the global financial crisis. (Yields rise when prices fall, so the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF IEF lost 14.6% over that stretch.)There are a few rules of thumb that are helpful for bond investors to take note of when navigating choppy markets like this one. One has laid dormant in the fixed-income markets for nearly 15 years: a concept known as escape velocity. This concept is a useful one but requires dusting off.What is Escape Velocity?Higher bond yields realign the risks that investors should emphasize when choosing what bonds to invest in. When yields are low, that means bond prices are not discounted very much relative to the face value of the bond (effectively the amount of the loan). With a lower price cushion, the risk of capital losses\u2014that is, bond prices falling owing to a subsequent rise in market rates\u2014is high. That makes a bond more attuned to shifts in the prevailing interest rate, all else equal. Duration is a way of expressing this relationship mathematically. It has a few ingredients: the face value of the bond, the coupon rate, the prevailing market interest rate, and years to maturity. By discounting the cash flows back to today, duration gives you an approximate measure of a bond\u2019s sensitivity to interest-rate movements, given its starting yield. A good rule is that you can expect a bond to rise or fall by its modified duration, which is denominated in years, for every 1 percentage point move up or down in interest rates. We can illustrate this concept with a hypothetical $1,000 plain-vanilla bond that matures in 10 years and pays out an annual coupon of 4%.\n\t\t\tRising Yields Mean Lower Durations\n\t\t      For most of the past 15 years, Treasury bond investors operated in an environment where yield was extremely hard to find\u2014not too dissimilar from the first two rows in this table. As evidenced by the table, lower yields modestly extend a bond\u2019s duration, creating a slightly bumpier ride for bond investors.In those types of situations, it\u2019s almost always true that a high-quality government bond\u2019s duration is greater than yield to maturity, which means that bond investors can expect a negative nominal return as rates rise. Take the example of a bond priced at par, found in Row 2 in the table above. If rates rise after the bond is bought, the fall in price offsets the coupon and the investor loses money.\n\t\t\tPerformance of a Hypothetical Bond at 4% Yield to Maturity\n\t\t      Bummer, right? But as interest rates start to creep up, that no longer has to be the case. The north and south poles of bond investing invert: Yields rise, and bond prices fall. If the conditions are just right, yields can actually overtake duration. That\u2019s where escape velocity comes in, and stuff starts to get really weird.How Does It Work?Let\u2019s take the example of the bond in the bottom row of the table above. If rates start at 10% instead of 4%, an investor would pay $631 upfront instead of $1,000. If rates rise by 1 percentage point, the bond\u2019s duration of 7.2 means it will lose roughly 7.2% of its value\u2014not fun. However, an investor still has a margin of safety: $632 is a lot cheaper than $1,000, and they still have the same amount of coupons coming in the door, and time has passed, which brings the investor a year closer to their bond maturing.\n\t\t\tPerformance of an Identical Bond at 10% Yield to Maturity\n\t\t      Inclusive of all of those levers, one can expect that over a calendar year the gears of bond math will overturn the initial price decline and an investor will end up with a positive nominal return of 3.3%. This math holds over the entire life of the bond, which means rates can rise to almost 19% and the investor will still end up with a positive return.\n\t\t\tTime value of Money Outweighs Rising Yields as a Bond Approaches Maturity\n\t\t      Which Bonds Have Reached Escape Velocity?It varies from bond to bond, but generally speaking short-term bonds with a duration of less than three years are the only bonds that are currently at escape velocity in aggregate.\n\t\t\tOnly Short-Term Bonds Have Reached Escape Velocity\n\t\t      That means that for investors who own bonds in this bucket, the direction of rates generally doesn\u2019t affect the price of their investments enough to outweigh the margin of safety gifted by the time value of money. Investors can make enough for the next several years from the coupons they receive, boosted by the passage of time, that it doesn\u2019t matter quite so much whether the bond market itself is in the red or in the black. However, it also means that most bond investors are still toeing the line between current bond yields and future interest-rate changes. What can they take away from this tipping point?ConclusionsIn the current interest-rate environment, escape velocity indicates that short-term bonds are on sale. Investors have fled the asset class in droves, hollowing out that bond market segment in favor of a barbell of shorter-term securities like money market funds, which have even higher yields, and bonds with a longer time horizon, which offer more certainty.It\u2019s not hard to figure out why. Don\u2019t fight the Fed, as the saying goes. John Rekenthaler discussed in his column just yesterday that long-term bonds have merit for investors who are confident that the Fed is close to finished with its current hiking cycle, as it has suggested. Meanwhile, cash-like instruments are going for an even deeper discount than short-term bonds are, providing all the income that some investors need to satisfy near-term goals. All along the yield curve, investors are bracing for the impact of impending rate cuts. But they are flocking to extremes in the process, and yield curve timing is a complicated art. Escape velocity suggests that there may be some value\u2014or even more surprisingly, some peace of mind\u2014to be had in the messy middle.        3 Top Stocks for the Next 10 Years   Watch","Article Author":"Madeline Hume","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Sep 5, 2023"},"36":{"Article Title":"How to Use Cash in a Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/how-use-cash-portfolio","Article Content":"Should you have cash in your portfolio? It depends. Many investors don\u2019t need to load up on cash if they\u2019re saving for long-term goals, but cash plays a critical role for retirees and other investors with shorter-term spending needs.In this series on portfolio basics, I\u2019ll explain some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Is Cash?Cash doesn\u2019t only refer to the bills in your wallet. The term is broadly used to describe not just hard currency but other safe, liquid holdings such as Treasury bills, money market funds, and bank accounts.There are a lot of these assets out there. Based on the most recent quarterly report from the Federal Reserve, U.S. households own about $4.2 trillion in checking accounts and U.S. currency, $9.5 trillion in savings accounts and short-term instruments, and $3.2 trillion in money market funds. If you added in assets held by corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations, those totals would be even higher.What Role Should Cash Play in Your Portfolio?What Are the Advantages and Risks of Holding Cash?Cash has two main advantages: safety and liquidity. The U.S. dollar is perceived as a safe asset because while it\u2019s not backed by any physical assets, it\u2019s supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Outside of the United States, the U.S. dollar is a major reserve currency, meaning large amounts of dollars are held by central banks and major financial institutions to use for international transactions. Because the U.S. dollar plays such a key role in the global economy, it\u2019s generally considered to be a reliable store of value globally. Cash is also safe because it essentially never loses value, at least in nominal terms. Moreover, cash is the most liquid asset. You can easily spend U.S. dollars. You can also easily access cashlike assets, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market funds, to make purchases, asset transfers, and debt payments.This safety comes at a price: lower returns. As shown in the chart below, cash has both the lowest risk and the lowest returns of any major asset class over time.\n\t\t\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: Cash and Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Because cash has no potential for capital appreciation, returns on cash are driven by yield. Over the past 40 years or so, yields on the three-month Treasury bill have ranged from a high of 16.3% in May 1981 to a low of 0.5% in October 2021.After the Federal Reserve made a series of aggressive interest-rate hikes starting in early 2022, the target federal-funds rate has increased by more than 500 basis points. (More on how this works in the next section.) As a result, the three-month Treasury bill yield had reached 5.31% as of Aug. 24, 2023, which was actually higher than the most recent inflation number over the past 12 months.\n\t\t\t3-Month Treasury Bill Yield Since 1954\n\t\t      Source: https:\/\/fredhelp.stlouisfed.org. Data as of June 30, 2023. But holding cash isn\u2019t usually a good way to stay ahead of inflation, as shown in the table below. Because yields on short-term securities have been so low (until recently), annualized returns for cash have fallen behind inflation over most of these trailing periods. That said, returns on cash have edged slightly ahead of inflation if you look at the entire 96\u00bd-year period between January 1926 and now.\n\t\t\tAnnualized Returns for Cash vs. Inflation (%)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. When Does Cash Perform Best?As mentioned above, yield is the main driver of cash returns. The yield on cash is partly driven by Federal Reserve policy since the target federal-funds range sets the rate for overnight bank lending, which in turn has a major impact on borrowing costs and overall financial conditions. As a result, the federal-funds rate indirectly affects short-term interest rates for cash and other securities. However, current yields on short-term Treasuries and other cashlike assets also reflect the market\u2019s expectations for future inflation and interest rates. Some of the most generous periods for cash returns were in the 1970s and 1980s, but those periods were also marked by above-average inflation.\n\t\t\tAnnualized Returns for Cash and Inflation by Decade (%)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How Long Should I Plan to Hold On to My Cash Assets?Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework considers cash to be the only suitable asset for holding periods of 12 months or less. If you have a spending need coming up a bit further out, such as within one to two years, cash might also be the best parking spot.And it\u2019s always important to keep some cash on hand to cover unexpected emergencies, such as job loss, car repair, appliance replacement, and so on. Most financial advisors recommend keeping at least six to 12 months\u2019 worth of living expenses in cash as an emergency fund\u2014even if you don\u2019t end up spending it right away.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Cash?The answer to this question largely depends on your life stage. If you\u2019re many years away from retirement, you don\u2019t need to allocate much to cash, assuming you already have an emergency fund set aside, as well as enough liquid assets to cover any short-term spending needs. Setting aside cash gets more important as you get closer to retirement age. Financial advisors typically recommend that retirees keep at least one to two years\u2019 worth of expenses in cash or other low-risk assets. The reason? Holding cash gives you a ready source of liquidity for short-term spending and means you don\u2019t have to sell stocks or bonds when the market is down.Where\u2019s the Best Place to Stash My Cash?The table below shows some of the pros and cons of various ways to hold cash.\n\t\t\tWhere To Keep Your Cash\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar. What Funds Pair Well With Cash?If you\u2019ve already set up sufficient cash reserves, a U.S. large-cap stock fund, international-stock fund, or a bond fund could be a logical addition.U.S. large-cap stock funds: These funds are a key foundation for nearly every investor\u2019s portfolio. They\u2019ve produced outstanding total returns over time and are one of the best ways to generate wealth for long-term financial goals. As mentioned above, U.S. stocks currently make up about 60% of global market capitalization, so we consider them core holdings that could make up the majority of a portfolio\u2019s equity exposure.International-stock funds: Stocks located in markets outside the U.S. currently make up about 40% of the global market based on the value of shares outstanding. That makes them worth owning for the sake of getting more complete exposure to equity markets around the world. International stocks can also provide diversification benefits (especially as a hedge against weakness in the U.S. dollar) and exposure to leading companies outside the U.S.Bond funds: These funds typically help buffer against losses in years when the stock market is down (although rising interest rates and unexpectedly high inflation led to sharp losses for both stocks and bonds in 2022). Bond funds have also often had negative correlations with the equity market, which can help improve risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds.Should I Hold Cash in My Portfolio?You should hold some cash, but it\u2019s not really an investment asset because of its lack of growth potential. That means that you can think of your cash holdings separately\u2014not as a core component of your investment portfolio. While the generous yields currently available on cash may be tempting, keep in mind that it doesn\u2019t generate enough growth to help fuel long-term capital appreciation.Correction (Aug. 29, 2023): A previous version of this article stated that the 40-year high yield on the three-month Treasury bill was 15.1% in September 2021.

If you already have exposure to U.S. large-cap stocks, international stocks could be a logical addition thanks to their potential to improve portfolio diversification.In this series on portfolio basics, I\u2019ll explain some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are International Stocks?For investors who live in the United States, stocks of companies based in other countries are considered international stocks. International-stock funds can focus on developed markets (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan), emerging markets (such as China, India, or Brazil), or a combination of both.As of July 2023, non-U.S. stocks made up about 40% of global market capitalization. Because international stocks make up a significant portion of the available equity market, it makes sense for most investors to have some exposure to international stocks. Most international stocks are denominated in non-U.S. currencies and trade on exchanges in their local markets. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s stock is denominated in the new Taiwan dollar and trades on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, and Finland-based Nordea bank trades in the Danish krone on Nasdaq Copenhagen.The exception: American depositary receipts, or ADRs, which are certificates issued by a U.S. bank that represent ownership in foreign companies. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars and trade on U.S. stock exchanges.What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in International Stocks?International stocks have two main advantages: diversification and the potential to perform better than U.S. stocks over certain periods. In the past, non-U.S. stocks have had relatively low correlations with their U.S. stock counterparts, leading to better risk-adjusted returns for a globally diversified portfolio. As the economy has become increasingly global, though, U.S. and non-U.S. stocks have started moving more in tandem over the past couple of decades.There have also been certain periods, such as the early 1970s, late 1980s, and 2002 through mid-2008, when international stocks have fared better than their U.S. counterparts. These periods often correspond to periods when the U.S. dollar was weak: Stronger non-U.S. currencies mean that investors in international stocks come out ahead when their returns are translated back to U.S. dollars. More recently, however, international stocks have fallen behind, partly because of how the U.S. dollar has strengthened over the past 10 years or so.Along with their return potential, international stocks come with certain risks, including the impact of currency movements, political conflicts, and weaker accounting standards. This means that international stocks come with relatively high risks and returns. The table below shows annualized returns and standard deviations for international stocks in developed and emerging markets compared with other major asset classes over the past 20 years.\n\t\t\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: Cash and Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Historically, international stocks have lost as much as 50% or more during market drawdowns, such as the global financial crisis that started in late 2007 and the coronavirus-driven bear market in early 2020. On a quarterly basis, they\u2019ve been subject to losses as large as 20% or more. Like other stocks, however, international stocks go up more often than they go down\u2014helping them generate rewarding returns over time.\n\t\t\tOther Risk and Drawdown Stats (Since 1990)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How to Invest in International StocksThere are two main ways to invest in international stocks: by purchasing individual stocks or by purchasing a fund. Buying international stocks on local exchanges would probably be impractical for most individual investors. As mentioned above, ADRs are another more accessible option for purchasing individual foreign stocks. There are about 430 ADRs currently traded on major exchanges in the U.S., plus about 2,000 more that trade over the counter.But buying individual stocks also comes with additional risks. If you own one stock (or even as many as 20 different stocks), you\u2019ll be subject to stock-specific risk\u2014meaning that the odds of things going poorly are much higher than they would be with a diversified portfolio. In 2021, for example, nearly one out of every three ADRs lost 10% or more, even though non-U.S. stocks as a whole gained about 8% for the year.For most investors, broadly diversified index funds are the best way to invest in international stocks. Few active managers have been able to consistently outperform the overall market over time. Index funds, on the other hand, harness the market\u2019s collective wisdom about the relative value of each stock included in a given benchmark. They\u2019re also cheaper: Investors in actively managed international-stock funds pony up annual expenses of about 1%, on average, but the typical index fund costs less than half of that.If you only own one international-stock fund, I\u2019d focus on the foreign large-blend Morningstar Category rather than more specialized areas. The foreign large-blend category typically provides the broadest exposure to the overall market, and it isn\u2019t as subject to market swings that can cause growth, value, or region-specific funds to go in and out of favor over multiyear periods. Global large-blend funds can also be a good option if you want to get exposure to U.S. and non-U.S. stocks in a single package.When Do International Stocks Perform Best?Like all stocks, international stocks typically perform best during periods of strong economic growth, rising corporate profits, declining interest rates, and low inflation.As mentioned above, international stocks also usually fare best during periods of U.S. dollar weakness. The table below shows annualized returns for international stocks during some of their strongest periods.\n\t\t\tAnnualized Returns During the Best Times for International Stocks\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How Long Should I Hold My Investments in Large-Cap Stocks?Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework recommends holding international-stock funds for at least 10 years. We came up with this guideline partly by looking at the historical frequency of losses over various rolling time periods ranging from one year to 10 years. We also considered the maximum time to recovery, or how long it usually takes to recover after a drawdown.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in International Stocks?There\u2019s no easy answer to this question.Some people argue that you don\u2019t need separate exposure to international stocks at all, given that many leading companies in the U.S. earn a significant portion of their revenue from overseas. Vanguard founder Jack Bogle was famously skeptical about the value of international investing, arguing that non-U.S. companies can\u2019t keep pace with those in the U.S. based on innovation, productivity, technological advancement, and shareholder protection.On the other hand, skipping out on international stocks would mean missing out on some of the world\u2019s leading companies, such as Nestle SA, Samsung Electronics, and Novo Nordisk. Plus, international stocks can generate better returns at times when the U.S. might be struggling. And as mentioned above, international stocks currently make up about 40% of the market\u2019s overall capitalization globally.So, we maintain that most investors should probably have some type of exposure to non-U.S. stocks.We consider foreign large-blend funds to be core holdings that could make up as much as 40% to 80% of a portfolio\u2019s assets, although most investors will probably want to keep their exposure on the lower end of that range.Foreign large-growth and foreign large-value funds fill more specialized roles; we consider them \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that could make up as much as 15% to 40% of a portfolio\u2019s assets. Because of the higher risk inherent in emerging markets or region-specific funds, we recommend limiting them to 15% of assets or less.What Are the Best International-Stock Funds?The table below shows a subset of highly rated index funds dedicated to international stocks.

What Funds Pair Well With International-Stock Funds?If you\u2019ve already added an international-stock fund to your portfolio, a bond fund or U.S. large-cap stock fund could be a logical addition.Bond funds typically help buffer against losses in years when the stock market is down (although rising interest rates and unexpectedly high inflation led to sharp losses for both stocks and bonds in 2022). Bond funds have also often had negative correlations with the equity market, which can help improve risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds.U.S. large-cap stock funds are a key foundation for nearly every investor\u2019s portfolio. They\u2019ve produced outstanding total returns over time and are one of the best ways to generate wealth for long-term financial goals. As mentioned above, U.S. stocks currently make up about 60% of global market capitalization, so we consider them core holdings that could make up the majority of a portfolio\u2019s equity exposure.Should I Invest in International Stocks?While they won\u2019t outperform in every market, international stocks have produced solid returns over time.

But Mixing Them Can Be Lethal.","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/6040-isnt-dead-neither-is-bitcoin-mixing-two-can-be-lethal","Article Content":"Bitcoin has performed surprisingly well for the year to date. The CMBI Bitcoin Index posted a 76.4% return through July 2023 in defiance of the gloomy narratives that haunt the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.The trusty balanced portfolio has also beaten expectations as of late. Vanguard Balanced Index VBAIX has turned in a respectable 12.8% for the year to date after a lousy 2022 that augured the age-old question of whether the 60\/40 fund (referring to its split between stocks and bonds) might be dead. Balanced funds\u2019 performance owes a great deal to the excellent performance of U.S. stocks, which have returned a hearty 20.6%, as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index.So far in 2023, risk has paid handsomely. That fact may leave many investors wondering whether to add some extra firepower to their portfolio in the form of an allocation to bitcoin. Compared with other assets, though, bitcoin\u2019s volatility is more kerosene than kindling. Over the 10-year period ended July 2023, bitcoin was 16.8 times as volatile as Vanguard Balanced Index. (The only asset that comes anywhere close is oil, although the price history of the Dow Jones Crude Oil Index only goes back to 2015.)\n\t\t\tRolling One-Year Volatility of Bitcoin Exceeds Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Even though bitcoin has performed favorably since the last time we examined bitcoin\u2019s impact on the 60\/40 in 2021, its returns are still nearly 4 times as volatile as those of a balanced fund. That means that even a smidge of bitcoin changes the behavior of an investor\u2019s portfolio a whole lot.How Much Is a Lot?Let\u2019s say that in August 2013 a hypothetical investor added a 2% allocation to bitcoin to a costless 60\/40 portfolio\u2014that\u2019s $20 in bitcoin for every $1,000 invested. (For the purposes of this example, let\u2019s also assume the investor furnished that $20 investment from their bond portfolio, although it doesn\u2019t change the results much whether that money comes from stocks or bonds. We also rebalanced this portfolio on a monthly basis\u2014that will become important in a second.)Our study found that a 2% sliver of bitcoin reshaped the return profile of their portfolio nearly as much as adding a 10% stake in stocks would have: A 60%\/38%\/2% split between stocks\/bonds\/bitcoin yielded a standard deviation of 10.7 over the past 10 years, in line with how a 70%\/30% S&P 500\/Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond portfolio would have behaved.\n\t\t\tBitcoin Alters Standard Deviations Far More Than Additional Stock Exposure\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Further up the risk spectrum, a portfolio with a 5% stake in bitcoin had a risk profile closer to a 90\/10 portfolio than a 60\/40. In fact, if that hypothetical portfolio was a fund, adding bitcoin would have easily pushed it out of the moderate allocation Morningstar Category to which most balanced funds belong. The closest match among allocation categories is the aggressive allocation category, meaning that the portfolio leapfrogged the moderately aggressive allocation category altogether. (Meanwhile, any portfolio with a 10% allocation or more to bitcoin courted more risk than the S&P 500 on its own!) Decomposing that risk reveals even more. Effectively, a 1% allocation to bitcoin has a negligible effect on risk, either in terms of absolute volatility or relative contribution. But a 2% allocation to bitcoin explains close to 15% of a portfolio\u2019s overall volatility, a much heftier contribution. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation accounts for nearly 45% of the return volatility the portfolio experienced, and overall volatility was meaningfully higher.\n\t\t\tBitcoin's Relative Contribution to Risk Increases With Additional Exposure\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Although adding bitcoin does open up the risk throttle on these hypothetical portfolios, it\u2019s worth pointing out that investors would have been fairly compensated for doing so. A costless 60\/40 portfolio would have turned in a Sharpe ratio (a return metric that accounts for risk) of roughly 0.77 over the past decade. Each portfolio that contains bitcoin improves upon that result, although incremental improvements peak at a 5% slice.\n\t\t\tBitcoin Has Compensated Investors for Additional Risk\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. With that being said, our portfolios were crafted using a fairly narrow set of assumptions that aren\u2019t likely to hold in practice. That\u2019s because regulators in the United States have barred most brokerages from offering bitcoin alongside traditional stock and bond investments. Most digital assets are quarantined in a separate wallet or exchange account, which makes it tedious for investors to rebalance on a monthly cadence like we did in our study. Whether because of inertia or mental accounting or both, many investors opt not to rebalance at all.When it comes to security selection\u2014picking individual stocks, for example\u2014the \u201cDo Nothing\u201d approach may have some merit. But when it comes to asset allocation, there are consequences to portfolio neglect. For example, a 1% allocation to bitcoin (funded proportionally from stocks and bonds this time, to replicate the experience of segregating assets) can quickly spiral into a 60% allocation if investors fail to reap what they\u2019ve sown.\n\t\t\tFailing to Rebalance Has Significant Consequences for an Investor's Asset Allocation\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Even one annual rebalance makes a world of difference. There are some edge cases, like 2013 and 2017, where the allocation to bitcoin would have climbed above 5%. But mostly it plods along somewhere between 1% and 2%. For only 15 months out of the entire 10-year holding period does the portfolio overtake that 2% threshold where the portfolio experiences volatility that\u2019s out of spec with the risk profile of a 60\/40 portfolio.\n\t\t\tAnnual Rebalances Partially Succeed in Keeping Allocation to Bitcoin in Check\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. While the SEC weighs proposals that might broaden investor access to bitcoin by way of an exchange-traded fund, we see a marginal benefit to existing owners of digital assets who would have an easier time trying to rebalance this high-octane holding if it\u2019s permitted to live alongside their traditional investments. But without the investor protections that other asset classes provide, we continue to advise that investors treat purchases of digital assets (including bitcoin) as a sunk cost rather than an investable asset.Even so, there are investors who fall somewhere in between these two extremes and treat bitcoin as something more than a sunk cost but less than a full-blown portfolio holding. I would advise those investors to tread cautiously. Like caviar or dynamite, a little bit of bitcoin goes a long way.

The specifics will depend on several factors, such as your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance, but large-cap stocks are a good choice for inclusion in nearly every investor\u2019s portfolio.In this series on portfolio basics, I\u2019ll explore some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\u2019ll examine the most widely used types of investments and what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are Large-Cap Stocks?Large-cap stocks are defined based on their market capitalization (also known as market cap), which measures the total value of a stock\u2019s shares outstanding, or the number of shares that are publicly traded multiplied by the current stock price.Morningstar defines a stock as large-cap if it lands within the top 70% of aggregate market capitalization for a given market, such as the United States, Europe, or Canada. (Currently, stocks with market caps of about $12.8 billion or more qualify as large-cap.) Stocks with larger market caps tend to be widely recognizable names, such as Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon.com AMZN. By definition, large-cap stocks make up the majority of the available market, so it makes sense that they should make up a significant portion of most investors\u2019 total equity exposure.What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in Large-Cap Stocks?Large-cap stocks have several advantages. Because they\u2019re widely held by so many investors, they\u2019re extensively researched and liquid. Their sheer size means their performance is generally a pretty good gauge of the equity market overall.As shown in the chart below, large-cap stocks have generated strong returns over time. Over the 97 years since 1926, small-cap stocks have fared even better, with an annualized performance edge of about 1.5 percentage points per year. However, large-cap stocks have outperformed in more recent periods, such as the 14-year timespan following the global financial crisis.\n\t\t\tGrowth of $1 Over Time\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Along with their return potential, stocks come with certain risks. In contrast to bonds, which offer more certainty about their value at maturity, stocks are inherently riskier. And while bondholders receive periodic interest payments (typically at a set rate) in exchange for lending money to the bond issuer, the value of a stock is both difficult to model and constantly changing. This means that large-cap stocks come with relatively high risks and returns. The table below shows annualized returns and standard deviations for large-cap stocks compared with other major asset classes over the past 20 years.\n\t\t\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: U.S. Large-Cap Stocks and Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Historically, large-cap stocks have lost as much as 50% or more during market drawdowns, such as the global financial crisis that started in late 2007 and the tech stock correction that started in 2000. On a quarterly basis, they\u2019ve been subject to losses as large as 20% or more. That said, large-cap stocks go up more often than they go down\u2014helping them generate rewarding returns over time.\n\t\t\tOther Risk and Drawdown Stats (Since 1990)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How to Invest in Large-Cap StocksThere are two main ways to invest in large-cap stocks: by purchasing individual stocks or by purchasing a fund.Buying individual stocks isn\u2019t as hard as it used to be, as many brokerage firms now offer commission-free trades as well as fractional shares, which allow investors to buy smaller slices of a given stock if they don\u2019t have the assets available to cover the full share price.But buying individual stocks also comes with additional risks. If you own one stock (or even as many as 20 different stocks), you\u2019ll be subject to stock-specific risk\u2014meaning that the odds of things going poorly are much higher than they would be with a diversified portfolio. In 2021, for example, about 1 out of every 6 large-cap stocks lost 10% or more, even though the overall market generated positive total returns of about 26% for the year. For most investors, broadly diversified index funds are the best way to invest in large-cap stocks. Few active managers have been able to consistently outperform the overall market over time. Index funds, on the other hand, harness the market\u2019s collective wisdom about the relative value of each stock included in a given benchmark. They\u2019re also cheaper: Investors in actively managed large-cap stock funds pony up annual expenses of about 88 basis points, on average, but the typical passively managed large-cap stock fund charges less than half of that.If you only own one large-cap stock fund, I\u2019d focus on large-cap blend rather than large value or large growth. Large-cap blend typically provides the broadest exposure to the overall market, and isn\u2019t as subject to market vicissitudes that can cause growth and value stocks to swing in and out of favor over multiyear periods.When Do Large-Cap Stocks Perform Best?Large-cap stocks typically perform best during periods of strong economic growth, rising corporate profits, declining interest rates, and low inflation. The table below shows annualized returns for large-cap stocks during several recent bull markets.\n\t\t\tReturns for Large-Cap Stocks in Recent Bull Markets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Total returns are annualized. How Long Should I Hold My Investments in Large-Cap Stocks?Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework recommends holding stock funds for at least 10 years. We came up with this guideline partly by looking at the historical frequency of losses over various rolling time periods ranging from one year to 10 years.The idea is to minimize the odds that an investment is in the red at the same time that you need to access the money to fund a goal.Over a five-year period, for example, returns for large-blend and large-growth funds have been negative about 18% of the time. Over a 10-year period, the odds of incurring a loss are significantly lower.\n\t\t\tFrequency of Losses Over Rolling Periods Since 1990\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of Dec. 31, 2022. Numbers in the headings indicate the length of the rolling period in years. Another way to think about this issue is by looking at the maximum time to recovery, or how long it typically takes for a given fund category to recover after suffering a drawdown. As shown in the table below, large-blend and large-value funds have historically recovered within about six years. Large-growth funds have taken as long as 13 years to win back their losses after a market downturn.\n\t\t\tMaximum Time to Recovery for Large-Cap Stock Categories Since 1990\n\t\t      How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Large-Cap Stocks?The answer to this question largely depends on your portfolio\u2019s overall asset mix.If you\u2019re investing for a short-term (less than two years) or intermediate-term goal (two to six years), you\u2019ll probably want to tilt your portfolio more toward cash and bonds. If your time horizon is long enough, however, a larger stock allocation may make more sense.Within the equity portion of a portfolio, it makes sense to use the overall composition of the market as a starting point. Large-cap stocks account for more than 70% of the market\u2019s overall market capitalization; as a result, they\u2019re generally a good proxy for the performance of stocks in general.That\u2019s particularly true for large-blend funds, which we recommend as core holdings that could make up as much as 40% to 80% of a portfolio\u2019s assets. Large-value and large-growth funds fill more specialized roles; we consider them \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that could make up as much as 15% to 40% of a portfolio\u2019s assets.What Are the Best Large-Cap Stock Funds?The table below shows a subset of highly rated index funds focusing on large-cap stocks. I\u2019ve focused on large-cap blend funds that are broadly available through major brokerage platforms, with low investment minimums and ultralow expense ratios.\n\t\t\tA Few Highly Rated Large-Cap Stock Funds (Index Funds)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. The list below includes a few actively managed funds from Russ Kinnel\u2019s \u201cThrilling 31\u2033 list, which features funds with relatively low expense ratios, high Morningstar Medalist ratings, portfolio managers who have invested at least $1 million in their own fund, and above-average returns during the manager\u2019s tenure for at least five years.\n\t\t\tA Few Highly Rated Large-Cap Stock Funds (Actively Managed Funds)\n\t\t      What Funds Pair Well with Large-Cap Stock Funds?If you\u2019ve already added a large-cap stock fund to your portfolio, a bond fund or international-stock fund could be a logical addition.Bond funds typically help buffer against losses in years when the stock market is down (although rising interest rates and unexpectedly high inflation led to sharp losses for both stocks and bonds in 2022). Bond funds have also often had negative correlations with the equity market, which can help improve risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds.International-stock funds can provide more complete exposure to the global market. U.S. stocks currently make up about 60% of global market capitalization, but non-U.S. stocks account for the remaining 40%. And while correlations between U.S. and non-U.S. stocks have trended up over the past couple of decades, international stocks can offer diversification benefits. There are also certain periods in which international stocks have had a performance edge.Small-cap stock funds can also make a good complement to large-cap stock funds. They offer some diversification benefits and might enhance returns over longer periods. If you select a \u201ctotal market\u201d index fund, though, you probably don\u2019t need to add a separate small-cap stock fund. Most \u201ctotal market\u201d indexes provide broad exposure across the entire market-cap spectrum.Should I Invest in Large-Cap Stocks?As long as you have a long enough time horizon, large-cap stocks are a key foundation for nearly every investor\u2019s portfolio. They\u2019ve produced outstanding total returns over time, and are one of the best ways to generate wealth for long-term financial goals.","Article Author":"Amy Arnott","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Aug 7, 2023"},"40":{"Article Title":"Are Younger Investors Too Conservative?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/are-younger-investors-too-conservative","Article Content":"Last month, my esteemed colleague John Rekenthaler weighed in on the question of whether older investors have become too aggressive, based on research Vanguard conducted on retirement savers in the defined-contribution plans it record-keeps for.To summarize, John took the view that, yes, some older investors are too aggressive. To be sure, the near-retirees that invest in their plan\u2019s default option typically do just fine. But, as John points out in his piece, roughly half of older investors can\u2019t resist the urge to tinker when left to their own devices.On the flip side, Vanguard also found that younger investors largely don\u2019t fall prey to the same temptation. More than 75% of investors under the age of 35 invest in a single target-date fund, which is generally considered the gold standard for retirement saving. What Is a Target-Date Fund, and Why Do Young Investors Love Them?A target-date fund is a multi-asset strategy that gradually shifts from stocks to bonds over the course of the investor\u2019s life. Typically, people buy or are defaulted into one through their 401(k), IRA, or health saving account and select the strategy that has a year that lines up with the year they expect to retire. Target-date funds\u2019 key feature is a \u201cglide path,\u201d which describes how the investment adjusts the proportion of retirement savings that are allocated to different asset classes over time. As the riskier asset, stocks are the primary engine of an investor\u2019s returns over the long run, so most target-date funds start with a generous helping of them before gliding to a much lower allocation later on.Target-date funds have soared in popularity as the default option for automatic enrollment in defined-contribution plans, and to some extent the uptick in adoption reflects plan sponsors steering younger investors into the vehicle. But a good chunk of them are opting into these strategies, too, which is a welcome development: Our research has found that target-date fund investors have tended to fare better than average, capturing more of the funds\u2019 total returns when compared with other types of funds.That said, Vanguard also found that the younger participants in its record-keeping plans were still investing only around 89% of their assets in stocks. That is pretty low, as the average longer-date target-date fund we track stakes around 93% in stocks, as shown in the chart below.\n\t\t\tVanguard's Average Investor Allocates Less to Stocks Than the Typical Target-Date Fund\n\t\t      It appears that the average young investor in a Vanguard record-keeping plan is underweight stocks relative to the typical target-date fund. It\u2019s a puzzling finding at first, but there are a few simple reasons why this could be. The first is that the \u201cHow America Saves\u201d methodology accounts for the dominance of the biggest target-date strategies, which are more conservative than the norm. (Morningstar does not take assets under management into account when defining the average target-date fund.) The two biggest target-date series\u2014Vanguard itself and Fidelity\u2014collectively command almost 50% of all target-date assets under management. Their glide paths start with 90% in stocks, a notch more cautious than the average target-date series.The other issue could be friction. Target-date managers can\u2019t always invest all the way up to their desired strategic glide path\u2014they need to keep some cash on hand to meet redemptions. Investors, too, may not be fully invested all the time. This is more of a problem for younger investors, whose contributions each month make up a significant portion of their overall balance.Whatever the reason, it appears that younger investors are slightly more conservative in their retirement plans than they ought to be. The question is whether that\u2019s a problem. Could It Have an Effect on Younger Investors\u2019 Retirement Savings?The short answer appears to be no.Target dates glide the way they do because they strike a balance between two sources of wealth: human capital and financial capital. Early on in their careers, young people may lack savings (that is, financial capital), but they boast future earnings potential (human capital).The best way for someone early on in their career to improve their retirement outlook is by, in effect, converting their human capital into financial capital. They do so by socking away a portion of each paycheck. As time wears on and those savings compound, the picture changes, with financial capital approaching and eventually exceeding human capital.What does that have to do with one\u2019s stock allocation? It\u2019s important to keep in mind that, until around age 35, contributions make up more than half of an investor\u2019s overall balance, with investment returns making up the rest. Given that, modest changes in an investor\u2019s asset allocation don\u2019t make a very big difference.\n\t\t\tUntil Age 35, Contributions Make Up More Than 50% of an Investor's Total Portfolio\n\t\t      An example might help to illustrate why this is so. Assume that stocks earn about 10% a year, while bonds print about 6%. If a young plan participant invested 5% more in stocks than they do in the average Vanguard target-date fund, they\u2019d theoretically take home an extra 0.2% each year. So, let\u2019s imagine it\u2019s a 22-year-old investor who earns an average salary today and experiences the normal level of salary growth (broken out by gender, given the differences in growth and trajectory) over the course of their career. How would that participant\u2019s ending balance vary if they began by allocating 89% to stocks versus 93%, contributed 10% of their take-home pay, and received a standard employer match?When we run the numbers, we find that upping the stock allocation would add about $50,000 to that 22-year-old\u2019s account balance by the time they retire. (All figures are nominal and assume a 4% inflation rate.)\n\t\t\tInvestors Could Earn Roughly $50,000 From 10 Years of Extra Stock Exposure\n\t\t      But that pales when compared with the benefits the 22-year-old participant would reap by nudging her contribution rate a bit higher. For instance, if that investor chipped in 11% of their salary instead of 10% for the first 10 years of their career, it could add more than $300,000 to their ultimate balance.\n\t\t\tBut for Younger Investors, Contributions Make a Much Greater Impact\n\t\t      In that sense, quibbling over the asset allocation kind of misses the point. For young investors, it\u2019s contribution rate, and not the stock\/bond mix, that really moves the needle when it comes to the size of one\u2019s retirement nest egg.On the Other Hand \u2026With a 40-year time horizon to play with, the consequences of a young investor sprinkling on some added risk are minimal. Investors are not as likely to make trades when they\u2019re invested in a target-date fund and are less likely to yank money out when their investments start to slump.Vanguard, of course, is aware of this. With respect to its target-date series, the firm argues that any risk above what\u2019s absolutely necessary to deliver on investors\u2019 retirement savings goals is unwise. Vanguard maintains a 10% exposure in bonds in order to temper volatility during downturns and favors higher contribution rates of 12%-15% to give investors the best chance of success. With contributions packing such a big punch, why court any more risk when stocks slide?Still, it\u2019s hard to argue against an extra dash of equity if you can stomach it. Like young investors, stocks have a great deal of potential: In the long run, they do deliver excess returns over bonds, all else equal. The road to get there might be bumpy, but every little bit counts. It may take lower fees, higher equity, or extra contributions for young investors to meet their ultimate retirement goal. Then again, it more than likely will take some combination of all three.","Article Author":"Madeline Hume","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Aug 1, 2023"},"41":{"Article Title":"7 Things I Don\u2019t Own in My Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/7-things-i-dont-own-my-portfolio","Article Content":"As someone who writes about building portfolios for a living, I do research on many types of investments, ranging from tried-and-true core holdings to more-esoteric corners of the investment world. A key part of my job is to comb through the available evidence and help readers understand the pros and cons of various investment types for their own portfolios.But what do I actually do with my own money? Here, I\u2019ll discuss seven popular investment types on which I\u2019ve decided to take a pass. I\u2019ll also discuss the rationale behind why I\u2019ve decided not to incorporate each one.Actively Managed FundsI still own shares in a couple of actively managed funds. But they\u2019re mostly holdovers from a few rollover IRAs and make up a smallish slice of my overall assets. The majority of my fund holdings are passively managed index funds. This wasn\u2019t always the case. I spent the first part of my career analyzing mutual funds, and it\u2019s always fascinating to hear active managers explain the rationale behind their investment decisions. And there are a few active managers who have consistently added value for fund shareholders over time.But with more experience in both life and investing, I\u2019ve become more skeptical about the value of active management in general. Keeping the bulk of my assets passively managed also simplifies portfolio management. I can focus the majority of my time on making sure my overall asset mix is appropriate for my financial situation and goals instead of keeping track of whether an active manager is still adding value.At the risk of splitting hairs, I do own shares in Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B and VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF MOAT, which could both be considered quasi-actively managed portfolios. In addition to its business operations in insurance, energy generation and distribution, and rail transport, Berkshire maintains a large investment portfolio. The VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF tracks an index, but the index itself relies on human judgment. The Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index features companies that Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts believe have two key attributes: a sustainable competitive advantage and a low price compared with their estimated fair value. Real Estate Investment TrustsI have small stakes in real estate as part of my holdings in a diversified equity index fund and a target-date fund, but I don\u2019t have any dedicated exposure to REITs or other real estate stocks. I often see articles hyping up the importance of real estate in a diversified portfolio. Real estate is often touted for its generally low correlation with other equity assets, as well as its ability to generate above-average returns over time.I\u2019ve written about why I\u2019m skeptical about real estate in a previous article. There are two key reasons behind my jaundiced view: diversification and idiosyncratic risk. On the diversification side, I think the value of real estate as a portfolio diversifier has often been overstated. Over the past three years, for example, the real estate sector has had a correlation coefficient of about 0.86 when measured against the broader U.S. equity market. In addition, real estate has been subject to periodic downdrafts that are difficult to predict: Witness the 21% cumulative loss in the FTSE Nareit All Equity REIT Index from 1998 through 1999, or the 47% cumulative loss in the same index from 2007 through 2008.As these drawdowns suggest, there are a lot of idiosyncratic risks specific to real estate investing. I don\u2019t have any specialized industry knowledge that would give me a unique capability to mitigate these risks. Since I\u2019m not fully convinced about the merits of real estate in the first place, I\u2019ve put it in the \u201ctoo hard\u201d pile. Sector FundsThere\u2019s no question that innovations in healthcare, technology, and communications have the potential to enhance human progress for years to come. But there\u2019s often a disconnect between the growth potential of a given sector and its investment merit. By the time people start getting intrigued by the growth prospects for a given sector or industry, much of the potential is already priced into valuations. The technology sector, for example, which ranks as the most popular area for sector funds, is currently trading at 8% premium to estimated fair value.Over the trailing 10-year period through June 30, 2023, the average sector fund (including funds that have been merged or liquidated out of existence) has gained just 7%, compared with about 12.4% for diversified market benchmarks such as the Morningstar US Market Index. What\u2019s more, sector funds have been incredibly difficult for investors to effectively use in a portfolio. In the most recent edition of Morningstar\u2019s annual Mind the Gap study, we found that dollar-weighted returns for sector funds over the 10-year period through 2021 trailed time-weighted returns by more than 4 percentage points per year. With a track record like that, I\u2019m staying far, far away.Alternative InvestmentsAlternative investments are designed to offer something fundamentally different from mainstream asset classes. Morningstar defines these strategies based on their ability to modify, diversify, or eliminate traditional market risks. The universe of alternative funds ranges from strategies that attempt to limit or offset their equity exposure to those that focus on absolute returns, meaning they focus on capital preservation and aim to generate positive returns no matter what the market environment.As John Rekenthaler has pointed out, though, alts\u2019 track record is mixed at best. Some alternative-fund categories\u2014particularly systematic trend and equity market-neutral\u2014were successful during 2022\u2032s bear market. But over longer periods, they\u2019ve generally been disappointing. Over the past 15 years, the typical alternatives fund has gained less than 2% in annualized returns.Nontraditional equity funds, which employ strategies such as derivatives, shorting, and options overlays while maintaining exposure to traditional market risks, have fared a bit better, with annualized returns of 4.4% over the same period. But that\u2019s well behind the 8% return of a traditional 60\/40 mix of large-cap stocks and investment-grade bonds over the trailing 15-year period.Could alternative investments fare better going forward? It\u2019s possible. But I\u2019m not convinced.I BondsIn contrast to the areas discussed above, I don\u2019t have a philosophical objection to I Bonds, which are Treasury bonds that pay a fixed rate of interest plus another layer of interest that adjusts to keep up with the current inflation rate, with the inflation adjustment made every six months. I Bonds are one of the best ways to hedge against inflation, especially if you can purchase them at a time when they\u2019re offering an attractive real yield.They also boast tax benefits. I Bonds\u2019 accrued interest is exempt from federal taxes until they mature or are sold off, and all interest is free from state and local taxes.Why haven\u2019t I bought them? The reasons are pretty mundane: purchase limits and other practical drawbacks. For the most part, individual investors can only purchase $10,000 worth of I Bonds per year, making it tough to amass a big enough position to make a significant difference in an already-established portfolio. And I Bonds can only be bought and sold through the Treasury Direct website, which is reportedly somewhat clunky and out of date. At this point in my life, I\u2019m reluctant to add yet another login and password to my list, which will add complexity both during my lifetime and for surviving family members after my death.High-Yield BondsHigh-yield bonds offer a yield premium in exchange for their additional credit risk, with the yield premium over Treasuries historically averaging more than 500 basis points.They\u2019ve also generated above-average returns over time. Over the past 30 years, for example, the average high-yield bond fund has produced annualized returns of about 5.4% per year, on average, compared with 3.9% for the average intermediate-term core bond fund.But high-yield bonds also have some drawbacks. Because of their added levels of credit risk, they tend to be more equitylike than bondlike. Over the past three years, for example, the Morningstar US High-Yield Bond Index has had a correlation coefficient of about 0.85 versus a broad stock market benchmark. That makes high-yield bonds less useful as portfolio diversifiers than other fixed-income securities, such as investment-grade corporates, government bonds, and cash.High-yield bonds have also been subject to sharp drawdowns at times. During the global financial crisis, for example, high-yield bonds lost about a third of their value from June 2007 through August 2009.Overall, high-yield bonds don\u2019t look that compelling to me on a risk-adjusted basis. My main goal for fixed-income holdings is to offset the risk of my equity assets, so I\u2019ve given junk bonds a pass.GoldI\u2019ve written about some of the virtues of gold in a previous article. It has a relatively solid record as a safe haven during periods of market crisis and also sports a low correlation with most major asset classes. Over the past three years, gold had a correlation of just 0.12 when measured against stocks and just 0.43 when measured against investment-grade bonds.But I haven\u2019t been impressed enough to add it to my portfolio. Fundamentally, gold isn\u2019t a growth asset: Its value typically remains stable in inflation-adjusted terms over long-term market cycles. My primary investment goal is long-term growth, and I have enough cash and shorter-term bond holdings to add ballast during market drawdowns. If I were truly worried about some type of financial Armageddon, I\u2019d probably consider adding gold as an insurance policy, but I\u2019m still pretty sanguine about the prospects for investing in mainstream asset classes.ConclusionWould I ever consider adding a position in one of the areas discussed above? Maybe. If new evidence emerged about their merit or if I looked at the pros and cons again and came to a different conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily rule them out. At this stage, though, I\u2019m comfortable keeping them off-limits for my portfolio.Disclosure: Morningstar, Inc. licenses indexes to financial institutions as the tracking indexes for investable products, such as exchange-traded funds, sponsored by the financial institution.

How can bond managers compete with 5% yields on cash? What should\u2014and should not\u2014be in your core portfolio? This is Investing Insights.Welcome to Investing Insights. I\u2019m your host, Ruth Saldanha. Let\u2019s get started with a look at your Morningstar headlines.Netflix Surpassed ExpectationsNetflix released a solid earnings report for the second quarter, topping Morningstar estimates. The streamer\u2019s crackdown to turn password sharing into paid sharing led to the addition of almost 6 million subscribers. Netflix now boasts that it has more than 238 million global paid subscribers. Management says it expects growth to continue as the paid sharing plan is rolled out in all its markets. Despite the additional subscribers and fees, revenue lined up with estimates, partly due to stagnant average revenue per user in North America and Europe, Netflix\u2019s two largest regions. Revenue rose 3% to $8.2 billion. However, growth hasn\u2019t hit double digits since the fourth quarter of 2021, despite price hikes and the crackdown on password sharing. And once the benefits of paid sharing level off, attracting new subscribers will likely be challenging, even as competition in streaming is intensifying. Morningstar is upping its estimate for what Netflix shares are worth to $330 from $315. But still, the stock appears overvalued. United Airlines Q2 Results SoaredUnited Airlines reported robust second-quarter results, but higher costs loom on the horizon. The airline\u2019s passenger revenue surpassed Morningstar\u2019s expectations, and it almost sold out capacity, or available seats. Pilot hiring and delayed delivery of Boeing planes have constrained the U.S. airline industry. A shortage of air traffic controllers has led to capacity cutbacks. The playing field should remain level in the competitive industry as long as this continues. Morningstar expects higher revenue and booking rates across the board. Costs are starting to go up, however, as airlines try to push capacity beyond 2019 levels. Low fuel prices and unusually full planes should pay for these increases. Once either of these wavers, though, Morningstar expects lower profitability and the return of risky price competition. Morningstar is lowering its estimate for what United\u2019s shares are worth by $1, to $35 per share.PNC Projected Slower GrowthPNC Financial Services reported slightly weaker results than the biggest banks. The regional bank also projected slower growth in net interest income, or the money that banks make on loans for the full year, while larger lenders actually raised their outlooks. Rising funding costs like higher payouts to savers on their deposits and slower loan growth are driving the decline. Despite the down numbers, results came in close to Morningstar\u2019s expectations. Morningstar says regional banks will face more pressure on net interest income than the largest banks. That\u2019s in line with updated expectations, and it isn\u2019t leading to dramatic negative revisions like in the last quarter. PNC\u2019s revenue and net interest income are still set to grow this year, despite this year\u2019s banking crisis. Morningstar plans to update its forecast and may lower its $175 estimate for PNC shares. Currently, the stock looks undervalued.Inflation, Cash, and BondsNo one has escaped the effects of higher inflation\u2014whether it\u2019s when we are paying more for gas or groceries or utilities. To tame these prices, the Fed has been raising rates, and as a result, cash rates have skyrocketed\u2014in some cases to as high as 5%. How can bond managers compete? Madeline Hume is a NEXT senior research analyst for Morningstar Research Services, and she has been tracking this space and is here to talk about it. Madeline, thank you so much for being here today. Madeline Hume: Thank you for having me, Ruth.Bond Outlook 2023Saldanha: What do flows look like for bonds, especially short- and medium-term bonds?Hume: Overall, flows are pretty steady when you look at bond funds in general, but that belies a lot of volatility underneath. You\u2019ve got a large reallocation happening away from short-term bonds into bond funds that invest in longer-term bonds and also into cash. The category has lost a staggering $19 billion year to date, ranking among the highest in bond categories for outflows. Why Should Investors Consider Bonds?Saldanha: Is fleeing for bonds in favor of cash a good strategy right now? With yields being so high, why should investors consider bonds at all?Hume: Yeah, it\u2019s not a good idea now, and it\u2019s not a good idea ever. Cash and bonds both have yields, but ultimately, they serve different purposes in an investor\u2019s portfolio. Bonds have something that\u2019s known as duration, which basically means rate sensitivity. Cash doesn\u2019t have that. So effectively, you\u2019re comparing apples to oranges.Opportunity Costs of Holding Money in Bond FundsSaldanha: What about the opportunity cost of holding money in tied-up bond funds?Hume: The flip side of cash rates right now is, with cash, what you\u2019ve got is a yield that looks really promising and is quoted on an annual rate, but that rate can change at any time if interest rates are adjusting. When you think about asset allocation and diversification, it\u2019s a bit like a Ferris wheel. If something is up, that means that one asset class is performing well and another asset class is down, but that can change very quickly. So as I mentioned, with cash rates in particular, that can change nearly instantly.Bond funds, meanwhile, have money that\u2019s locked up for a little bit longer, and so you have a guaranteed rate that holds for a little bit longer period of time. There are benefits and there are drawbacks to that. The drawback is that your money is locked up, and so there may be a more promising rate elsewhere, but you have to remember that, with investing, the grass is always a little bit greener somewhere else.The reason that bond funds are not earning as much as cash right now is because yield curves are inverted, and that means that investors don\u2019t know as much about the short term as they do about the long term, so they command a little bit higher premium in order to keep their money in shorter-term investments because they\u2019re not sure if in six months or in 12 months the Fed is going to be lowering those interest rates.That\u2019s not the normal state of affairs. For investors, while they may be buying bonds now and those rates may be lower than what cash is, eventually rates will normalize and longer-term rates will come back up, and so there is this mean-reversion effect that you\u2019ve got going on. So for people who choose to put their money in cash, if rates fall, their yields immediately adjust, but bonds allow investors to reduce their reinvestment risk, and they don\u2019t have to necessarily worry about that scenario.Income in Investor\u2019s PortfolioSaldanha: What should investors do for the income portion of their portfolios right now?Hume: Cash yields are so tempting right now that it\u2019s easy to forget that we\u2019ve entered in an entirely new paradigm as far as interest rates go. Two years ago, a bond yielded about 0.21%, and today a two-year bond is yielding about 4.9%. So while you might be able to make marginally more money in cash, ultimately 4.9% is still nothing to sniff at. It\u2019s certainly much better than the scraps bond investors have been feeding on for the past 10 years. If you\u2019ve got the right asset allocation, ultimately the best advice that I have is to do nothing and let the markets do their thing.Saldanha: Great. Thank you for joining us with your perspectives, Madeline.Hume: Thank you so much, Ruth.5 Surprising Investments That Shouldn\u2019t Be Long-Term Core HoldingsSaldanha: Most of us construct our portfolios around some core holdings, and then there may be some fun or play holdings. New Morningstar research shed some light on the types of funds that should be in the core holdings for most investors\u2019 long-term portfolios\u2014and some that absolutely don\u2019t belong in that coveted core holding spot. Amy Arnott is a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, and she sat down with Morningstar Inc.\u2019s investment strategist Susan Dziubinski to discuss this. Let\u2019s listen to what they had to say.Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I\u2019m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. New Morningstar research shed some light on the types of funds that should be the core holdings for most investors\u2019 long-term portfolios. But what types of funds don\u2019t belong among an investor\u2019s core holdings? Let\u2019s find out. I\u2019m joined today by Amy Arnott, who is a portfolio strategist with Morningstar Research Services.Hi, Amy. Nice to see you today.Amy Arnott: Thanks, Susan. Nice to be here again.Dziubinski: Now, we\u2019ve talked before about your role in portfolio research, and viewers who are interested in learning more about that can watch the video through a link that will be included in the transcript. But give us a quick rundown of what the research is about and how investors can use it.Arnott: Sure. This role in portfolio framework is really designed to give investors practical guidance when they\u2019re trying to put funds together in a portfolio. It\u2019s not just about finding good funds with low expense ratios, but then taking the next step of how do you put them together in a portfolio in a way that makes sense for your specific financial goals. When we came up with this, there are two key dimensions: One is the time horizon, and the second one, as you mentioned, is the role in portfolio\u2014or what size should a position play within the portfolio.Dziubinski: Amy, in your research, you define four roles in portfolio that an investment can offer based on the diversification that it provides. And those four roles are stand-alone, core, building block, and limited. Now stand-alone funds are those one-and-done investments that are going to provide you diversification in one place, maybe a target-date fund or asset-allocation funds. Core funds are the funds that should take up the bulk of a portfolio for an investor who doesn\u2019t want to necessarily pursue that stand-alone approach to their portfolio, that one-and-done approach. The Morningstar Categories that qualified in your research as core holdings would be from the U.S. large-blend, the foreign large-blend, and the global large-blend categories. Why these three categories?Arnott: As you mentioned, we look at core holdings as something that would be appropriate for a large percentage of your assets, which we define as somewhere as much as 40% to 80% of your assets. And we look at core holdings as something that\u2019s going to give you broad representation for a major asset class. In the case of the three categories that you mentioned, we\u2019re looking for broad exposure to stocks in general. And the three categories that you mentioned we think are appropriate as core holdings on the stock side because they are really giving you a broad representation of the overall stock market. If you look at something like Vanguard Total Stock Market, VTI, for example, you\u2019re getting exposure not just to that middle section of actual large-blend stocks but also some exposure to large-growth and large-value. So, if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s going to represent the equity market in general, a fund like that or a similar fund from the foreign large-blend or global large-blend category is a good place to start.Dziubinski: Got it. So, you mentioned U.S. large value and U.S. large growth, and it may surprise some readers\u2014it surprised me a little bit\u2014that these types of funds, these fund categories don\u2019t actually fall under the definition of how you\u2019re defining the core fund camp. Instead, they\u2019re sort of the next tier down. They\u2019re part of that building-block type of holding in a portfolio. Walk us through why they aren\u2019t core.Arnott: If you look at large value or large growth, these are smaller slices of the equity market, so it\u2019s not giving you quite the same level of broad market exposure. Another issue is that just as we found that it\u2019s very difficult for active managers to outperform by deviating from a market index, it\u2019s also very difficult to outperform by overweighting a specific investment style. If you do that, there might be periods when you have good returns. For example, on the large-growth side, that style outperformed by a pretty wide margin over most of the period from 2009 through 2021. But there have been other times when that would have really hurt your results. For example, during the technology correction that started in the year 2000, large-growth stocks fell behind by a pretty wide margin. And it would have taken you a long time, actually more than 13 years, to make up that loss. So, there\u2019s definitely more risk associated with overweighting either value or growth.Dziubinski: Got it. So, now, another surprise for some investors might be that U.S. small-cap blend, small-cap value, and small-cap growth, those categories aren\u2019t considered core in your framework. And in fact, they\u2019re not even considered building blocks. They were assigned the limited role, which is even further down the ladder. Why is that?Arnott: It all goes back to the idea of using the neutral market portfolio as a starting point for your equity investments. And typically, you want to keep your allocations in line with how the overall market is allocated. And so, if you look at the U.S. equity market, actually less than 10% of the outstanding market cap is in those small styles: small value, small blend, and small growth. So, that\u2019s why we assign those limited roles.Dziubinski: Got it. From a practical perspective, Amy, if investors, say, combine a U.S. large-cap growth fund with a U.S. large-cap value fund, have they really just assembled the equivalent of a U.S. large-cap blend fund? And then, in that case, if that\u2019s what an investor is doing, could that really, those two funds combined, serve as the core of a portfolio?Arnott: You certainly could do it that way. Starting out with equal weightings between large value and large growth, you would just have to make sure that you\u2019re keeping an eye on those allocations over time so that they\u2019re not getting out of balance. And you probably want to be rebalancing them once a year at least, or anytime the allocations get significantly out of balance.Dziubinski: Amy, thank you so much for your time today. This role in portfolio research is really wonderful, and we look forward to talking with you more about it.Arnott: Thanks. Great to be here.Dziubinski: I\u2019m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

As a result, investors may wonder why they should invest in international stocks as more U.S. companies benefit from global growth. We sat down with Morningstar Indexes strategist Dan Lefkovitz for a quick rundown of his new paper, Global Equity Markets Grow Even More Global, and what the implications are for investors.Susan Dziubinski: You recently authored some new research examining the revenue streams of nearly 8,000 companies around the globe. Your goal was to find out how much revenue companies were generating outside of their home markets. Why the undertaking?Dan Lefkovitz: In equity investing, we tend to think about geographic exposure in a one-dimensional way: Where\u2019s a company based? Looking at revenue sources adds a new dimension to our understanding. It can illuminate both risk and opportunity. Morningstar collects geographic segment data reported by thousands of companies across the world, and we can aggregate that data to the national equity market level using Morningstar country indexes. This helps answer questions like: How national are national markets? Where do they source their revenues? How have they changed over time? Dziubinski: You found that revenue streams of companies around the world are, in general, becoming more global. Delve into that.Lefkovitz: We started conducting this study in 2019\u2014prepandemic. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve seen markets become increasingly global in their revenue sources. That runs counter to the narrative that the pandemic and geopolitics are turning countries inward. For example, the Morningstar US Market Index is only 61% U.S.-based from a revenue perspective, compared with 66% in our 2019 study. Japan, most of Western Europe, Canada, and Australia all source a larger share of revenues from outside their home markets. According to our estimates, many European equity markets earn more in revenue from the U.S. than they do at home.Dziubinski: You note in your paper that the revenue globalization trend is most pronounced among developed countries and less pronounced among emerging markets. Why is that? Lefkovitz: Europe is home to many multinational companies. If you think about Nestle NSRGY of Switzerland, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy MC of France, Denmark\u2019s Novo Nordisk NVO, or Shell SHEL and BP BP of the U.K., these companies do business across the globe. In the U.S., companies like Apple AAPL, Meta META, Alphabet GOOGL, and Microsoft MSFT are global players. Some of the biggest constituents of the Morningstar Japan Index are Toyota TM and Sony SONY.On the flip side, emerging markets tend to have fewer multinationals. The Chinese equity market is dominated by local players. Banks, telecoms, and utilities are common atop emerging market indexes, and they tend to be domestically focused. There are some exceptions: Tech companies in India, South Korea, and Taiwan; and Brazil\u2019s natural resources exporters.Dig deeper: Global Equity Markets Grow Even More GlobalDziubinski: Other research has shown that the correlations between U.S. stocks and non-U.S. stocks have risen over the past two decades. Is the trend of globalizing revenue the reason why international stocks, as a group, have been less effective portfolio diversifiers for U.S.-based investors than they\u2019d been in the past?Lefkovitz: Globalizing revenue sources have likely contributed to equity markets moving in lockstep. Developed markets, which are the most globalized, are more correlated with each other than emerging markets are with developed markets. To bring this concept to life, think about biopharma companies. Whether they\u2019re based in the U.S., France, Switzerland, or Japan, they are exposed to many of the same forces. On the flip side, a bank in Indonesia and a bank in Canada don\u2019t have much in common. Dziubinski: If U.S. companies are generating more and more of their revenues from outside of the U.S., should investors even bother investing in international stocks? Put another way, are investors already getting exposure to international growth by owning U.S. companies?Lefkovitz: I like to invert this logic. If I neglect international stocks, I lack exposure to some of the leading businesses in the U.S. market. I live in the U.S., but my kids play Nintendo on a Samsung TV; I fill up my Japanese car at a British gas station; I fuel myself with a Swiss coffeemaking machine, then go running in German shoes. In investing, it makes sense to broaden the opportunity set to the fullest. There are unique companies, industries, and growth drivers that you can\u2019t get access to through a purely domestic portfolio.More Investment Portfolio Strategies Why Your Portfolio Needs International Stocks The long-term strategic rationale for building a global portfolio. 5 Surprising Investments That Shouldn't Be Long-Term Core Holdings Many would consider these types of funds to be core holdings.

This year to date, fixed-income returns are positive, with those bonds that trade with a credit spread having performed better than U.S. Treasuries.This year to date, the Morningstar Core Bond Index, our proxy for the overall bond market, has risen 2.83%.

Data as of July 19, 2023. The yield curve became further inverted in the first half of 2023. Short-term interest rates rose as the Federal Reserve hiked the federal-funds rate three times and another hike is expected at the July meeting. For example, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill rose 107 basis points to 5.49% and the yield on the one-year Treasury rose 59 basis points to 5.32%.However, on the longer end of the curve where the market dictates interest rates, as opposed to the Fed\u2019s monetary policy, yields have declined slightly.

For example, the Morningstar Corporate Bond Index (our proxy for investment-grade corporate bonds) rose 4.30% and the Morningstar High Yield Bond Index rose 6.81%. The reason for the outperformance was twofold. First, those bonds provide a higher yield to compensate investors for the risk of credit rating downgrades or defaults. Second, credit spreads tightened over the first half of the year. In the corporate bond market, for the year to date through July 19, the average corporate credit spread of the Morningstar Corporate Bond Index has tightened 11 basis points to +119.

Further, according to our U.S. economics team, we project that longer-term interest rates are at or near their peak and will begin to decline over the next six to 18 months.Another factor that supports extending out further on the yield curve is our expectation that the rate of economic growth will slow. While the stock market has risen from the undervalued levels we saw at the beginning of the year, stocks are now trading near our fair value. With stocks no longer undervalued and earnings under pressure from slowing economic growth, further gains in the stock market will likely be muted in the second half of this year.At this point, corporate bonds are less undervalued than we thought at the start of 2023, but based on our economic outlook (slowing growth, but no recession), we think the current credit spreads offer an adequate margin of safety to investors to offset future downgrade and default risk. Interest-Rate ProjectionsOver the second half of 2023, interest rates may vacillate as economic and inflationary metrics are released, but our forecast is that the interest rate on 10-year Treasuries will generally follow a downward trend which will continue into 2024 and 2025. Falling interest rates will push up long-term bond prices and help bolster fixed-income returns over the underlying yield carry.While short-term interest rates are currently higher than long-term interest rates due to the inverted yield curve, we think investors should begin to lengthen their duration over the next 12 months. Once the market begins to price in the Fed switching to an easing monetary policy, short-term rates will quickly begin to subside. We project the fed-funds rate will average 4.15% and 2.15% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\t\t\tMorningstar Interest Rate Forecasts\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of June 26, 2023 End of This Monetary Policy Tightening Cycle in SightThe Federal Reserve paused and held the fed-funds rate steady at its June meeting. However, with inflation still running hotter than the Fed prefers and the economy more resilient than expected, we expect that the Fed will likely hike the federal-funds rate another 25 basis points at its July meeting. Yet, we also expect that will be the final interest-rate hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle. We expect that inflation will continue to moderate enough over the next few months to convince the Fed that it has raised interest rates enough to be appropriately restrictive to keep inflation on a downward path.Not only do we expect this will be the last hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle, but we also forecast that a combination of declining inflation and a slowing rate of economic growth will provide the Fed with the basis to begin loosening monetary policy in early 2024, with a rate cut coming as early as next February. Corporate Bond Market OutlookCorporate bonds have performed very well over the first half of the year. Performance has been driven by a combination of tightening credit spreads and the higher yield carry offered by corporates. At this point, corporate bonds are now less attractive than we noted in our 2023 bond market outlook published last December. However, we think that current spread levels are adequate to compensate investors for potential downgrade & default risk.According to PitchBook, defaults have risen back up to historical averages. Based on our economic outlook for the rate of economic growth to slow, we suspect there will likely be an additional increase in downgrades or defaults. However, considering we do not expect the economy to slip into a recession, the amount of downgrades and defaults will likely be constrained and remain below levels experienced in prior recessions.The combination of higher underlying interest rates and closer-to-average credit spreads is providing investors with some of the higher all-in yields we have seen in corporate bonds over the past 10 years. The Morningstar Corporate Bond Index currently yields 5.29% and the High Yield Index yields 8.03%. The main risk to our view is if the economy slips into a deeper and\/or more prolonged recession, in which case default rates could rise.Watch: 2023 Midyear Market Outlook","Article Author":"David Sekera","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Jul 21, 2023"},"45":{"Article Title":"Why Large-Blend Funds Should Outweigh Value Plus Growth Funds in a Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/why-large-blend-is-better-than-value-plus-growth","Article Content":"Large-blend funds have much to recommend them. They\u2019re the easiest way to get broad exposure to the U.S. equity market. The category is home to some of the industry\u2019s biggest funds, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VTSMX. And Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio framework, which I rolled out earlier this year, considers large-blend funds suitable as core holdings, meaning that they could make up as much as 40% to 80% of an investor\u2019s portfolio.But there\u2019s more than one way to build a portfolio; you could obtain similar market exposure by combining a large-value fund and a large-growth fund. However, there may not be a lot to be gained by doing so.Reason #1: Better Market CoverageMorningstar defines large-blend funds as those that are fairly representative of the overall U.S. stock market in size, growth rates, and price. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large-cap. The blend style is assigned to portfolios where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate, and these portfolios usually invest in a wide range of economic sectors. The average large-blend fund offers pretty good exposure to a full spectrum of stocks, as shown below. While purists might prefer to stick with funds that only focus on truly large-cap stocks, having some exposure to small and midsize stocks isn\u2019t a bad thing, either.\n\t\t\tLarge Blend Equity-Style Exposure\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of May 31, 2023. Large-value and large-growth funds, on the other hand, are generally more concentrated toward their respective corners of the Morningstar Style Box.Reason #2: Similar Long-Term PerformanceAbout a year ago, John Rekenthaler ran some numbers to test whether buying equal stakes in Vanguard Value Index VIVAX and Vanguard Growth Index VIGRX and periodically rebalancing would yield better results than buying Vanguard 500 Index VFIAX. The two-fund portfolio had an annualized return advantage ranging from 10 basis points to 28 basis points over rebalancing frequencies ranging from monthly to five years. There was no return difference for a 10-year rebalancing schedule.One drawback of this analysis: the fund results only go back to November 1992. And the three funds aren\u2019t exact analogues, since the Value and Growth funds now track segments of the CRSP Large Cap index rather than value and growth stocks carved out from the S&P 500. I decided to take a fresh look at this question using a trio of Russell 1000 indexes, which have performance histories dating back to 1979. The Russell 1000 Value Index carves out stocks with lower price\/book ratios and lower projected growth rates, while the Growth Index consists of stocks with higher price\/book ratios and better projected growth rates for revenue and earnings. The Russell 1000 Index combines the holdings of both indexes.The results were underwhelming, to say the least. As shown in the table below, there was virtually no difference in performance for a two-index test portfolio relative to the large-blend benchmark over most rebalancing frequencies. Of all the tempos tested, the seven-year rebalancing schedule looks most promising. While an annualized performance edge of 18 basis points might elicit a response of \u201cmeh,\u201d it could be worth the effort if you have a very long time horizon and are disciplined enough to stick to the schedule (and remember to rebalance). Over the past 44 1\/2 years, an initial investment of $10,000 split between value and growth and consistently rebalanced every seven years would have ended up with a portfolio value of about $1.6 million, or about $110,000 greater than $10,000 invested in the Russell 1000 Index.\n\t\t\tTesting the Value Plus Growth Portfolio\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct and author's calculations. Data as of June 30, 2023. I also tested a threshold rebalancing strategy, which involved rebalancing the two-index portfolio whenever one of the components drifted more than 5 or 10 percentage points away from its initial weighting. Here too, there\u2019s not much to write home about. The 5% rebalancing strategy for the two-index portfolio came out ever so slightly ahead of the blend index over the full period, but the difference in returns was small. The 10% rebalancing strategy, on the other hand, led to slightly lower returns.\n\t\t\tTesting the Value Plus Growth Portfolio: 5% and 10% Rebalancing Bands\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct and author's calculations. Data as of June 30, 2023. And while value and growth have taken over market leadership over various periods (such as growth stocks over the period 2009-21 and value stocks in 2022), the results for the two styles weren\u2019t dramatically different over the full period from 1979 through mid-2023. Despite academic research supporting a long-term performance advantage for value stocks, growth issues came out slightly ahead over the past 44-odd years in my study. But the difference was less than 30 basis points per year. While growth edged out value, both style indexes fell slightly behind the Russell 1000 over the full period.\n\t\t\tGrowth of $10,000\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Reason #3: Minimal Diversification BenefitsWe took a deep dive into correlation coefficients for various asset classes in our 2023 Diversification Landscape report. As shown in the table below, most investment styles have fairly high correlations with the overall market. Morningstar\u2019s Large Growth and Large Value indexes had correlations of 0.92 and 0.89, respectively, with the Morningstar U.S. Market Index. There might be some risk reduction benefit from diversifying into value and growth, but it\u2019s pretty small. What\u2019s more, combining value and growth into one portfolio would wipe out any potential diversification benefits.\n\t\t\tThree-Year Correlation Matrix by Investment Style\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. When Large Value Funds and Large Growth Funds Are Worth OwningHowever, style-specific funds can still play a useful role. If you own a stock or fund that you\u2019re reluctant to sell, you might end up with a portfolio tilted toward either value or growth. For example, someone owning a large stake in Apple AAPL (such as yours truly), might end up with a portfolio tilted toward the Large Growth corner of the Morningstar Style Box. Investing in a value-oriented fund could help offset the portfolio\u2019s growth bias.An investor could also deploy a style-specific fund to take advantage of valuation discrepancies if growth stocks seem more attractively priced than value, or vice versa. As of May 31, large-value stocks covered by Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts had an aggregate price\/fair value ratio of 0.82, compared with 0.97 for large-growth issues. If our analysts\u2019 fair value estimates are accurate, large-value stocks should generate higher returns as market prices converge to fair value. But as the rebalancing tests above suggest, reversion to the mean doesn\u2019t always happen on a predictable schedule. ConclusionStyle-based investing has gained favor since Eugene Fama and Kenneth French\u2019s landmark research in 1992. The three-factor model they came up with (and Morningstar popularized with the Morningstar Style Box) goes a long way toward explaining investment performance and risk. But while it seems plausible that combining growth and value could lead to better results over time, that does not seem to be the case.","Article Author":"Amy Arnott","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Jul 17, 2023"},"46":{"Article Title":"Is It Time to Break Up With the Bonds in Your Portfolio?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/with-cash-rates-nearing-5-is-it-time-break-up-with-bonds-your-portfolio","Article Content":"Investors concerned about inflation have many lingering effects to worry about, including higher prices at the gas pump, in the grocery store, and on utility bills. But there is one bright spot: Because of persistently high inflation, cash rates have skyrocketed, with rates on some high-yield savings accounts, money market funds, and other cash instruments reaching yields as lofty as 5%.Bond investors might feel left out, especially if their investments are maturing soon. As of July 2023, 2-Year Treasury bonds issued in July 2021 pay out a paltry 0.2%, and funds in the short-term bond Morningstar Category lost an average of 5.2% last year. These facts might explain why short-term bond funds have the largest net outflows of any bond category this year to date, hemorrhaging $19.4 billion through the end of June. There\u2019s reason to wonder if it might not be better to seek the sure thing and move into cash; with flows that massive, there\u2019s reason to believe many investors already have.\n\t\t\tBottom 5 Bond Categories By Flows YTD\n\t\t      Why Should I Keep Bonds in My Portfolio?With cash rates this high, are short-term bond allocations redundant? The short answer is no.Cash rates are easy come, easy go. (Although investors with money parked in traditional savings accounts, which still yield less than 1% in many cases, might beg to differ.) Savings rates may be denominated in annual percentage yield terms, but they are rarely locked in for any sort of fixed term. Banks can dial the rate up or down, essentially at will. That means cash lacks duration, one of the more useful tools in an investor\u2019s quiver. Duration solves a different portfolio problem than cash, which means that bonds and cash shouldn\u2019t be compared like-for-like.Cash might be a handy parking spot for emergency savings, but for expenses any further than two years out, bonds are the better match. That\u2019s because bonds are typically offered with a yield that\u2019s fixed over the life of the bond.For example, if you buy a bond with a duration that aligns with the time your payment is due, you can lock in a yield over that time horizon that fits with your liability. In the meantime, you won\u2019t have to worry about reinvesting your savings to chase a better rate if interest rates fall\u2014unlike investors who are keeping their money in cash. Put another way, for investors that can hang on to their bond investment to maturity, what happens to interest rates after they buy their bond isn\u2019t terribly important. If an investor holds a bond until it expires, at the end of that period, (assuming the issuer is creditworthy) they are made whole. When a bond matures, its owner gets their principal back, and they can use the proceeds to address their saving goals.Sounds Great, Except \u2026In the meantime, your money is effectively tied up. It\u2019s possible that bonds underperform other asset classes (like cash) while you hold on to them, and there\u2019s not much you can do about it. It\u2019s even possible to lose money if rates rise and you sell a bond before it matures.But, again, investors generally won\u2019t experience any observable losses in bonds held to maturity. On the other hand, investors in a short-term bond fund have a very different row to hoe, with both yields and returns fluctuating on nearly a daily basis. How is it possible that bond funds lose money when an individual holding a bond can always opt to stick it out and recoup their principal? There are a few reasons for that. First, funds have to manage cash flows in a way that an individual owning a bond doesn\u2019t. An investor owning a single bond only has to worry about the coupons they receive and the principal that the issuer repays at the end. But every single day people buy into and sell out of mutual funds; they\u2019re a pooled investment, after all. Plus, managers can only distribute cash at certain pre-specified times, which means they must reinvest the coupons they receive in the interim. Bond managers trade bonds all the time, even if all their existing investors sit tight.Beyond the constraints of the mutual fund vehicle, bond funds behave differently from individual bonds in another key respect. An individual bond\u2019s duration will decline as it approaches maturity.\n\t\t\tDuration of a Hypothetical 5-Year, 5% Semiannual Bond\n\t\t      Bond fund managers typically maintain a constant maturity, which means that unlike an individual bond, the fund never expires. A fund that invests in short-term bonds will continuously roll forward its bonds so that its maturity will always be roughly several years out from today. As one bond nears maturity, the fund will buy another to nudge the portfolio\u2019s maturity forward and keep its duration stable.\n\t\t\tDuration of Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF, 2019-2023\n\t\t      This mechanism causes the returns of an investment with a constant maturity, like a bond fund, to vary depending on the path that interest rates take.Then Why Do Investors Stick With Short-Term Bond Funds?Partly it\u2019s a matter of convenience. Bond investing obeys the economies of scale, which makes it a good candidate for outsourcing. There\u2019s an old rule of thumb in bond investing that you need at least $100,000 to adequately diversify a bond portfolio\u2014hardly chump change. Plus, money managers get better rates on transactions than retail investors do.Additionally, it may be easy to guess roughly when an event that you\u2019ve been saving up for is going to occur, but in many cases it\u2019s much harder to pin down the precise timing of the cash outlay. In these types of situations, individual bonds may be too fine an instrument. If you have a goal that you\u2019re saving for with an uncertain start and end date, a basket of bonds with constant maturity gives you critical leeway in your portfolio.Finally, even if you don\u2019t have a timed goal in mind, your portfolio may still stand to benefit from carrying some duration. Very short-term instruments like cash are currently paying more than longer-term investments because yield curves are inverted.\n\t\t\tUS Treasury Yield Curve\n\t\t      That\u2019s not the normal state of affairs. Longer-term rates are typically higher than shorter-term rates, and eventually the current pattern will reverse. That means that over longer periods a yield boost does kick in for holding bonds instead of cash.How much duration you should hold depends on a whole host of other factors, like your age and the time until the goal you\u2019re saving for. No matter what your priorities are, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that bonds tend to outperform stocks during bear markets. That makes them a good ballast to have on hand, no matter what else is happening in the markets.","Article Author":"Madeline Hume","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Jul 17, 2023"},"47":{"Article Title":"What I\u2019ve Done Right With My Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/what-i-got-right","Article Content":"If you read my column last week, you might have concluded that my investment portfolio is a mess. By my own admission, I hold too much company stock and too much cash, and I don\u2019t have anything close to the recommended allowance of bonds for a person my age. And while I often write about tax matters and understand the tax code pretty well, my record on curbing taxes hasn\u2019t been perfect. I\u2019ve held tax-inefficient funds in a taxable account and have been slow to move money into IRAs each year. Inertia (laziness, sloth, whatever you want to call it) has been the major factor behind almost all of these problem spots.But you know what? Despite these missteps, my husband and I have managed to do just fine from a big-picture standpoint; our financial plan is well in hand. Here\u2019s what has worked for us, as well as my most unscientific assessment of whether the successes resulted more from luck or skill.We Maintained a High Savings RateJust as an all-black wardrobe can conceal unwanted holiday pounds, so can a high savings rate cover up a multitude of investment sins. So when I think about what has worked for us from an investment standpoint, over the long haul, a high savings rate has to be at the top of the pyramid. Luck played a starring role in our ability to save: My husband and I had the good fortune of emerging from college debt-free, which enabled us to buy a house and start saving for retirement early in our careers. We\u2019ve also both been employed for three-plus decades, meaning that we\u2019ve been able to steadily sock away a good share of our incomes and benefit from employer-matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and a long runway of investment compounding. I have previously mentioned that we don\u2019t have a budget, but automating our investment contributions\u2014not just into our company retirement plans but into our taxable account as well\u2014has helped us be disciplined about saving in good markets and bad. That\u2019s not to say we haven\u2019t made sacrifices, especially earlier in our careers. We spent many a weekend working on our old house when we were just starting out, and I\u2019ve always taken my husband\u2019s hand-me-down cars and driven them for a long time. The home renovations were fun\u2014mostly!\u2014and I\u2019m not into cars so it\u2019s a stretch to call either of those things a big sacrifice. Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 30% luck\/70% skillStocks DeliveredWe\u2019ve also lucked out in terms of market performance during our years of investing. There have been some bad spots: 2000-02 and 2007-09, to name the biggies. But over our 35-year horizon thus far, stocks have returned about 11% on an annualized basis. That\u2019s a fabulous rate of return by any measure and one that we fully benefited from thanks to an equity-heavy posture throughout the period. Of course, stock market returns over any specific time horizon are mainly luck of the draw, but I\u2019m giving us a few skill points here, too. While I haven\u2019t calculated an internal rate of return for our investments over our entire time horizon, I know that we haven\u2019t pulled back from stocks during times of market duress. We\u2019ve kept on investing and even added extra to them, above and beyond our automatic contributions, when we\u2019ve had extra cash on hand during such periods. It has helped that we\u2019re too busy to think much about our investments, and intellectually we understand that stocks invariably shake off their periodic swoons.Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 80% luck\/20% skill We Curbed Investment CostsLimiting investment costs has been another important tailwind, one that enabled us to \u201creceive our fair share of the market\u2019s returns.\u201d (I can never write those words without hearing Jack Bogle\u2019s booming baritone in my ears.) I quickly got religion on the importance of limiting costs shortly after starting at Morningstar in 1993. The first investing book I read in my new job was Burton Malkiel\u2019s \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street,\u201d which makes a compelling case for low-cost passive investing. And as an analyst, I learned that expense ratios were much more predictive of a fund\u2019s future prospects than its past returns. Morningstar\u2019s 401(k) investment menu skews toward low-cost investments, too, and my husband and I gravitated to cheap funds for the rest of our portfolio. It\u2019s hard to know where luck ends and skill begins with this one, so I\u2019m calling it a draw.Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 50% luck\/50% skillWe Kept It \u201cBasic\u201dJust last week I learned that my taste in all sorts of things (Lululemon, avocado toast) is what the kids might call \u201cbasic.\u201d And my preferences in the realm of investing products are most definitely basic, too. I\u2019ll admit that we got off to an inauspicious start on this front: Our very first non-401(k) investment was the niche-y and high-cost Templeton Developing Markets TEDMX, the result of me attending an early Morningstar Investment Conference and enthusiastically trusting the long-term prospects for emerging markets. We also dabbled in individual stocks early on, in that period in the late 1990s when everyone seemed to be opening a brokerage account. But our portfolio was largely anchored in core stock funds from the start. I had become an avid reader of Bogle, Jason Zweig, Bill Bernstein, and Jonathan Clements, all of whom enthused about the virtues of a minimalist, low-cost investing approach. My own cynicism about the investment industry grew, too, as I observed the all-too-familiar pattern of firms launching products only after an asset class had enjoyed a strong runup in the market. While we have steadfastly maintained a healthy allocation to non-U.S. stocks, which has certainly held back our results relative to a U.S. 60\/40 allocation, that\u2019s about as exotic as it gets for us. Just as important is what we\u2019ve avoided: We haven\u2019t bitten on alternative investment products, cryptocurrency, thematic funds, or any number of other investment fads that have come and gone over the years. I haven\u2019t run the numbers, but I know ignoring the fads has redounded to the benefit of our long-term results.

While most analyses of the nation\u2019s growth in wealth disparity analyze how wages have risen faster for high-income employees than for everyday workers (thus, the ongoing complaints about CEO pay), I included the effect of a second item: The Great Bull Market.Given that equity returns have overwhelmingly outstripped wage increases over the past half-century, and that wealthy Americans are much likelier to own stocks than their compatriots, the rise in stock prices has overwhelmingly helped the affluent.A valid argument. (If I say so myself.) Since the 1970s, the top wage earners have not only outstripped others\u2019 incomes, but they have also benefited most from the stock market\u2019s boom. Throw in the profits from real estate investing, which have also mostly accrued to the wealthy, and that\u2019s quite the trifecta! The Missing Piece: Investment PsychologyBut of course, more can be said about the subject, which Bill Bernstein amply does in the newly released second edition of his 2002 classic, The Four Pillars of Investing. The book covers a wide range of territory: investment theory and history, financial advisory practices, and portfolio construction. But Its section on investor psychology best addresses what my argument omitted.(Note: I provided a back-cover blurb, but alas will not be receiving any of the book\u2019s revenue.)When Bernstein wrote the first edition of Four Pillars, as a relative newcomer to the field, he was enthralled by the numbers. Investment research is bounded by science. In contrast with many of his quantitatively minded peers, though, he recognized from the start that investment math could also be a trap. History never repeats exactly\u2014sometimes not even approximately. For that reason, he addressed investor psychology. Twenty years later, he has expanded on that message. The second edition opens by contrasting two investors: 1) the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, run by two Nobel Laureates, and 2) Sylvia Bloom, a legal secretary. The former belied its name by surviving only four years, while the latter persisted for 67 years, with great success. Writes Bernstein, \u201cUnlike the geniuses at LTCM, [Bloom] wasn\u2019t trying to get rich quick, but rather to get rich slow\u2014a much safer bet.\u201dThat sentence neatly summarizes Bernstein\u2019s counsel. Speculators pursue high returns; investors seek appropriate returns. Four Pillars spends little time on the obvious forms of speculation, such as buying meme stocks or trading options. No need to beat that horse; the book\u2019s readers either already realize the futility of tail-chasing, or they bought the book because they are ready to absorb that lesson.Four Pillars instead addresses the type of errors that educated investors might unknowingly make\u2014and that Bloom did not. They include 1) becoming seduced by investment narratives, as made by intriguing but ultimately mediocre theme funds; 2) succumbing to recency bias; and 3) believing too strongly in one\u2019s own abilities, thereby discounting the wisdom of the crowd. (Is the marketplace crazy? Perhaps. But that occurs far less often than most investors believe.) The Biggest MistakeThe most dangerous delusion, states Bernstein, comes not from how investors perceive the outside world, but instead from how they view themselves. The first edition of Four Pillars included a risk-tolerance table, to help readers establish their equity allocation. For example, investing 80% of one\u2019s assets in stocks might lead to a 35% portfolio decline, under unusually bad (although not the worst possible) circumstances, while owning 40% would cut the loss to 15%.Writes Bernstein in the second edition:I neglected to ask whether readers had actually lost 15%, 25%, or 35% of their portfolio. Simply looking at this table or running a portfolio simulation on a spreadsheet is not the same as facing real-world losses. The stock market only rarely falls for no good reason \u2013 bear markets are almost always the result of incipient financial system collapse, hyperinflation, or the prospect of nuclear annihilation. The fear of real geopolitical and economic catastrophe makes such times the most dangerous mountain passes on the highway of riches. That is, it is not enough to have been in the right place at the right time, as wealthy Americans have been during the past 40 years. Investors must also know how to convert their paper opportunities into tangible dollars, by making sound decisions that withstand the test of time. Underinvesting is an obvious problem, as one can\u2019t pocket stock market gains without stocks. But overinvesting can also be a costly error. Getting rich slowly means finding the appropriate personal level.That conclusion may seem simple, but enacting it proves surprisingly difficult. Over the years, tens of millions of investors have crashed upon the asset-allocation rock. Such a fate, however, is unlikely to befall those who read Four Pillars. By the time the reader encounters Bernstein\u2019s homily on risk perception, the book already established 200 pages of context, with another 100 yet to follow. The advice is therefore not hollow. It echoes.ConclusionMy previous two columns, on whether older investors have become too aggressive and the inadequacy of alternative investments, can broadly speaking be regarded as defending relatively high equity exposures. I am happy to defend those claims. If taken in context, they are (I believe) both accurate and helpful.But no investment argument tells the full story. Although also supporting the concept of holding stocks for the long term, Four Pillars does so from a different perspective. It not only complements my thinking but also sometimes challenges it.

As international stocks in general have fallen behind the U.S. market for more than a decade, emerging markets, which are generally defined as countries that have lower levels of income per capita and are making the transition to become more developed, have been even weaker.Over the trailing 15-year period through June 30, 2023, the Morningstar Emerging Markets Index has generated annualized returns of just 3.1% per year, compared with 4.1% for the Morningstar DM xUS Index. The picture looks even worse over the past 12 months. As developed-markets stocks have rallied to a 17.1% gain, emerging-markets stocks have gained just 4%. As a result, diversified emerging-markets funds (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) have suffered about $8.9 billion in net outflows for the trailing 12-month period through May 2023.These disappointing results notwithstanding, there are still valid arguments for investing in emerging-markets stocks. In this article, I\u2019ll look at risk-adjusted returns over longer periods, as well as other reasons investors may not want to give up on emerging markets just yet. The Rise and Fall of Emerging MarketsBy definition, emerging markets should have greater growth potential than more established equity markets. As mentioned above, emerging markets generally produce less economic output relative to the size of their populations. As these countries become more industrialized and integrated with the global economy, rapid economic growth can follow, often accompanied by robust equity-market returns.That is exactly what happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dates back to the end of 1987, just as global economies were opening up and investment capital was flowing into markets that were formerly unavailable. As a result, rolling three-year returns for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index trounced more-developed markets by healthy margins through over most periods up until early 1995.\n\t\t\tRolling Three-Year Difference in Returns\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. The trend reversed in the mid-1990s following the Mexican peso crisis in December 1994 and the Asian currency crisis in 1997. Emerging markets fell behind their developed counterparts from 1994 through 1998, and lagged again in the tech correction in 2000. Driven by robust economic growth in China and rising global commodity prices, emerging markets then entered a secular bull market that lasted until the global financial crisis in 2008.After staging a strong (albeit partial) recovery in 2009 and 2010, emerging markets ran hot and cold in the following years. Both 2013 and 2021 stand out as examples of what can go wrong. Emerging-markets stocks fell about 17 percentage points behind developed-market issues in 2013, when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it planned to slow down its bond-buying program and tighten monetary policy. They fell out of favor again in 2021 because of market worries over slower economic growth and regulatory uncertainty in China, which makes up about 30% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. These dramatic swings in performance were accompanied by above-average risk levels. As shown in the table below, standard deviation for the emerging-markets benchmark has been about 30% higher than that of developed markets since 1988, and emerging markets have also been subject to more extreme drawdown risk. Recovery times have been prolonged, as well. After the painful drawdown during the global financial crisis, for example, emerging markets didn\u2019t fully recover until nearly 10 years later.\n\t\t\tReturn, Risk, and Drawdown Stats (Jan. 1, 1998, through June 30, 2023)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. However, emerging markets\u2019 volatility has been partly offset by their relatively low correlations with U.S. markets. The correlation coefficient between emerging markets and the U.S. equity market has averaged about 0.66 since performance data started in 1988. As a result, adding emerging markets to a globally diversified portfolio (including both U.S. and non-U.S. stocks) has led to better risk-adjusted returns more often than not. To test this, I created two separate portfolios: One with a 30% stake in developed-market stocks and the remainder in U.S. equities, and the other with a 20% stake in developed-market stocks, 10% in emerging markets, and the remainder in U.S. equities. The emerging-markets version came out with better risk-adjusted returns in about 68% of all trailing three-year periods since 1988.\n\t\t\tRolling Three-Year Difference in Risk-Adjusted Returns\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Assessing the Odds Going ForwardWill emerging markets continue to add value going forward? There are a few key considerations. The dollar\u2019s strength versus other major currencies is one of the most important ones. Emerging markets typically fall behind when the dollar strengthens, which is one of the main reasons they\u2019ve lagged over the past 15 years or so. A strong U.S. dollar often hurts emerging-markets economies because it raises the cost of imports (including food and energy) and leads to less foreign investment.\n\t\t\tEmerging-Markets Performance vs. U.S. Dollar\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Valuation is another key consideration. Valuations for emerging-markets stocks have declined, leading some investors to argue that they\u2019re currently undervalued. In terms of relative valuation, though, emerging markets haven\u2019t declined all that much. Emerging-markets stocks typically trade at a discount to stocks from developed markets, partly reflecting their higher levels of political and economic risk. Emerging markets also have fewer safeguards for investor protection and can be subject to bribery and corruption. Over time, price multiples such as price\/book, price\/sales, and price\/earnings are typically about 40% lower for emerging markets relative to the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\t\t\tEmerging-Markets Valuations vs. U.S. Market\n\t\t      Viewed from this perspective, valuations for emerging markets don\u2019t look all that compelling. The Morningstar Emerging Markets Index currently trades at about 11.4 times earnings for the trailing 12-month period, compared with a longer-term average of 13.5. Relative to the U.S. market, though, the P\/E multiple is now 0.56, which is only slightly lower than the longer-term average of 0.59.Another argument frequently made in favor of emerging markets is their greater growth potential. Based on data from the International Monetary Fund, emerging markets made up about 58.3% of global gross domestic product and 86.1% of the global population in 2022. As markets continue to develop and modernize, emerging markets\u2019 share of the global economy should expand. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that the rapid economic growth many investors now expect will materialize, or that if it does, economic growth will translate into stock market gains for emerging markets.ConclusionEmerging markets\u2019 growth potential and generally low correlations with more developed markets make them worth including in a diversified portfolio. A prolonged period of weakness in the U.S. dollar could also provide a tailwind. However, their higher levels of risk make deviating from the global market-cap weighting (currently about 8%) a risky bet.","Article Author":"Amy Arnott","Label":"Protfolio","Article Source":"Morningstar","Article Date":"Jul 10, 2023"}}
