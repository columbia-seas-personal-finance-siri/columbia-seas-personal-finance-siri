So, it's not surprising that many investors don't know where to begin. And although the market is well above its recent bear market lows, plenty of stocks are trading for significantly less than they were a year or two ago.\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n\n\nBut what are the best stocks to buy in 2023? Although I don't have a crystal ball that tells me what stocks will deliver the best returns, I've tried to do the next best thing. In this article, I'll discuss 10 stocks that I think could be great buys in 2023 for long-term investors looking to put their money to work.\n\n\nWhy these 10?Why these 10?Before we get to the stocks, let's acknowledge three caveats:Choosing the best stocks to buy today depends on your personal financial situation. To get a feel for where you stand, read our guide on how to invest in stocks. It walks you through topics such as establishing an emergency fund, allocating assets, and choosing the right stocks for you.I like these stocks as long-term investments, even in a bear market. I have absolutely no idea what they'll do over the next few weeks or months. In fact, if inflation stays elevated longer than expected, interest rates climb higher than investors believe they will, or the U.S. falls into a deep recession, it's entirely possible that most or all of these could decline in the near term.Although I ensured some variety, the list below isn't meant to be a fully diversified portfolio. Instead, they're my highest-conviction long-term stocks to invest in for 2023 and beyond. The best one-step way to diversify your holdings is to build the core of your portfolio around something like the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (VT  -1.36%).Now let's get to my list of the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for the long term -- from smallest market cap to largest -- followed by the summarized buy thesis for each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublicly Traded Company\n\n\nA company that issues shares that are publicly traded, meaning the shares are available for anyone to buy and sell on the stock market.\n\n\n\n\nThe top 10 stocksThe top 10 stocks to buy in October 2023Etsy (ETSY  -3.65%), $8 billionPinterest (PINS  -4.03%), $18 billionRealty Income (O  -0.2%), $38 billionMercadoLibre (MELI  -2.47%), $67 billionPayPal (PYPL  -2.15%), $68 billionShopify (SHOP  -4.85%), $75 billionIntuitive Surgical (ISRG  -2.35%), $105 billionWalt Disney (DIS  -2.61%), $150 billionBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A  -1.14%)(BRK.B  -1.45%), $815 billionAmazon (AMZN  -3.66%), $1.42 trillion\n\n\n\n\n\nElevator pitches for each stockNow that you've seen my top 10 best stocks to buy now, you may be wondering why I picked each company. Here's a quick rundown of why I'm such a fan of each as a long-term stock to invest in.1 - 31. Etsy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, Etsy was growing nicely by connecting craft makers with customers looking for something a bit more out of the ordinary than mainstream e-commerce fare. During the pandemic, e-commerce got a huge boost. But Etsy absolutely skyrocketed, growing at more than twice the rate of overall e-commerce.As the pandemic and its accompanying e-commerce surge have cooled off, so has Etsy's momentum. However, its growth has been strong across all product categories and continues to be impressive despite the tough economic climate. In fact, in the second quarter of 2023, Etsy's marketplace sales volume was up 175% over comparable pre-pandemic (2019) levels.As you may notice throughout this list, powerful platforms get my attention. Make no mistake: Etsy is one of them. Few e-commerce companies go head-to-head with Amazon and survive. Etsy not only survived when Amazon rolled out its own handmade items platform -- it won. But this could still be the early days of an excellent long-term growth story.Because of its platform and brand strength, Etsy's market opportunity is in the hundreds of billions -- if not trillions -- of dollars. With about $13 billion in sales on its platform in 2022, it has just started to scratch the surface. And with the stock falling significantly in the recent growth stock downturn, now could be a great time for patient long-term investors to take a closer look.2. Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest is an oasis of positivity in a social media landscape that's grown increasingly depressing and divisive. That partially flows from what Pinterest is about -- ideas.People go to Pinterest to focus on things, not on other people. Whether building a dream deck, baking a kid's birthday cake, or updating your wardrobe, Pinterest gives people visual inspiration for the things they want to get done.Recent results show that Pinterest's growth has resumed, with the user base growing by 8% year over year to 465 million in the second quarter of 2023. There's still lots of long-term user growth potential, and management recently said that growth is re-accelerating.The most exciting thing from a long-term investor's perspective is that Pinterest has a massive opportunity when it comes to the monetization of its users. This is especially true internationally, where the bulk of Pinterest users are located but where the least monetization has occurred.There's also a big monetization opportunity as the company pivots away from its traditional ad-focused model and tries to find ways to incorporate e-commerce into its platform. And the pivot certainly makes sense.Pinterest is a place where people go to find things they might want to buy, and it hired e-commerce veteran Bill Ready as its CEO in 2022 to accelerate its pivot. It could take a while for the company to truly realize its e-commerce potential, but it is making impressive progress, and long-term investors could be handsomely rewarded.\n\n\n3. Realty Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to value, growth, and income, it's tough to find a more well-rounded stock for long-term investors than Realty Income.If you aren't familiar with it, Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and primarily invests in freestanding, single-tenant retail properties. Walgreens (WBA  0.58%), Dollar General (DG  1.74%), and FedEx (FDX  -1.86%) are just a few examples of its top tenants.Realty Income owns about 13,100 properties in the U.S. and Europe, most of which are rather recession-resistant and less vulnerable to e-commerce disruption than many other retail businesses. Plus, the company's triple-net lease structure helps create a steady, predictable income stream.The proof is in the performance. Since its 1994 listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Realty Income has produced 14.2% annualized total returns, handily outperforming the S&P 500. It has paid 639 consecutive monthly dividends, and as of September 2023, its yield is about 5.7%. The company has increased its payout for more than 100 consecutive quarters, and there's no reason to think this pattern will end anytime soon.\n\n\n4 - 64. MercadoLibre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of my favorite long-term stock investments in the market, MercadoLibre is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, and for good reason. The company operates an e-commerce marketplace with a dominant presence in some of the region's most populous nations, including Brazil and Argentina.However, there's a lot more to MercadoLibre. It operates a fast-growing payments platform called Mercado Pago, a logistics service known as Mercado Envios, a business lending platform, and more.The marketplace saw $10.5 billion in merchandise volume in the second quarter of 2023, 47% higher than the same quarter in 2022. Mercado Pago processes almost $170 billion in annualized volume, with almost three-fourths coming from outside the company's e-commerce platform.Both main parts of the business are growing rapidly. And don't overlook Mercado Credito, the company's young but fast-growing (and highly profitable) lending business. Mercado Credito has $3.3 billion of outstanding loan balances and has grown rapidly so far.The best part is that all these businesses are in the relatively early stages. MercadoLibre's merchandise volume is roughly 8% of Amazon's, and its Mercado Pago payment volume is about 12% of the amount that PayPal (PYPL  -2.15%) processes. So, there's a ton of runway ahead.MercadoLibre isn't just the Amazon of Latin America -- it's the Amazon, PayPal, Square, Shopify, and more, all rolled into one. And it's in a much earlier stage of growth. As the e-commerce and fintech landscapes in Latin America evolve over the coming years, MercadoLibre could be a major long-term beneficiary.5. PayPal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayPal is an absolute cash machine that has been beaten down by about 75% from its highs.The main reason is that investors were disappointed when PayPal's growth abruptly slowed down in 2022, and management conceded that its previous user growth targets were unrealistic. Plus, with fears of a recession, we could certainly see lower consumer spending in the near term -- which would mean lower fee income for PayPal.However, it's important for investors to realize that this is still a strong and highly profitable business. The company has about 430 million active users between PayPal and Venmo and processes about $1.3 trillion in annualized payment volume. The company expects about $5 billion in free cash flow for 2023 and has been aggressively buying back its own stock.It's not hard to see why PayPal's management is choosing to use its capital this way. The stock is trading at its lowest price-to-sales ratio ever and trades for just 12 times forward earnings.6. Shopify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopify operates a platform designed to allow businesses of all sizes to sell their products online, with a particular focus on empowering smaller businesses and growing with them by establishing long-term relationships.Shopify offers a subscription plan starting at $39 per month for businesses and many adjacent services that help businesses operate smoothly, such as payment processing solutions and logistics.Shopify's \"one-stop shop\" approach to enabling e-commerce has turned it into a powerhouse. It now has more e-commerce sales flowing through its ecosystem than any other company besides Amazon. However, Shopify could be just getting started.The platform has generated $6.3 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. However, this is just a fraction of its estimated $153 billion (and growing) market opportunity as more retailers shift their focus to online sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nRevenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered.\n\n\n\n\nE-commerce is still in the relatively early stages, making up slightly more than 15% of retail sales in the United States. Shopify has the No. 2 share, giving it a powerful ecosystem with network effect advantages over competitors.The stock's price is still well below the highs in the recent market downturn due to recession fears and signs of a slowdown in consumer spending, and Shopify looks like a great long-term opportunity.\n\n\n7 - 107. Intuitive Surgical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobot-assisted surgery beats shaky human hands. That general thesis hasn't changed much from when I first noticed Intuitive Surgical stock in 2005. The da Vinci surgical system is the clear market leader, and the \"razors and blades\" model helps it generate a recurring stream of revenue as its systems are used to perform procedures.Intuitive Surgical is dominant in its space, with a market share of about 80% worldwide. And it has lots of room to grow as the adoption of its surgical systems and the number of supported procedures increase over time. This is particularly true in many international markets, where the implementation of robot-assisted surgery could be a long-tailed growth catalyst for this excellent business for decades to come.8. Disney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House of Mouse is like the all-weather tires of a portfolio. The pandemic hurt its theme park and movie businesses but helped the Disney+ streaming service, which has grown into a powerhouse years earlier than Disney expected.In fact, Disney+ now has about 146 million subscribers fewer than four years after launching, while the company's initial five-year goal called for 60 million to 90 million. To be sure, Disney is still trying to figure out the best ways to make Disney+ a profitable business, but it's clearly progressing in the right direction. The market is absorbing price increases with little impact on the subscriber count.In 2023, demand for Disney's theme parks, movies, and cruise line has been very strong despite inflation pressures and recession fears. In fact, revenue is far greater than in comparable pre-pandemic times in Disney's parks due to initiatives that have driven higher per-guest spending. Plus, the company recently announced it will invest $60 billion over the next 10 years in its theme parks and cruise lines to make sure they stay full for the foreseeable future.With Disney also laser-focused on the profitability of Disney+ and its other streaming platforms, Hulu and ESPN+, this could be a powerful combination of profitable all-weather revenue streams. In a nutshell, Disney might be the ultimate combination of an in-person experiential play and a tech-focused growth business.Its amazing stable of intellectual property (Marvel Cinematic Universe\/Star Wars\/ESPN\/Pixar\/Disney) and cash-machine theme park business gives it a margin of safety that makes it perhaps the safest stock on this list. And it still has tremendous profit growth potential as the newer areas of its business evolve.9. Berkshire Hathaway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough most of this list is made up of growth stocks, or at least stocks that have some exciting growth drivers, this is the relatively boring value pick of the bunch (but in the best possible way).Berkshire Hathaway owns a collection of about 60 subsidiary businesses, including household names such as GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, just to name a few. Berkshire also owns a portfolio of common stocks worth about $355 billion that includes massive stakes in Apple (AAPL  -0.78%), Bank of America (BAC  -2.96%), Chevron (CVX  0.23%), American Express (AXP  -2.96%), and Coca-Cola (KO  -1.08%), as well as positions in dozens of other companies.Most of the larger positions were personally handpicked by legendary investor Warren Buffett, who still manages the bulk of Berkshire's investments. In fact, If Berkshire were a mutual fund, it would be the world's largest actively managed mutual fund.The Buffett bears will say he has lost his fastball, but Berkshire continues to produce market-beating returns in most years despite its massive size. And while Berkshire certainly won't produce the 3,787,464% return (not a typo) it has produced from the time Buffett took the helm through the end of 2022, there's no reason to believe it won't continue to outpace the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future.Buffett won't be in charge forever. But Berkshire is his legacy, and he's been stress-proofing it for years to ensure it's in solid shape long after he's no longer running things. Showing his faith, he and longtime business partner Charlie Munger have been buying back shares regularly. That's a good sign for patient long-term investors like us.10. Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon doesn't really need much of an elevator pitch for most people. The company has a dominant lead in the U.S. e-commerce market. And its Amazon Web Services cloud platform is also a market leader, with a significant lead over the other two large players in the space, Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -1.3%)(GOOG  -1.38%).However, more growth potential exists than you might think. We're a long way from maximizing e-commerce adoption; it still accounts for a little more than 15% of all U.S. retail sales. The cloud industry is relatively young and expected to roughly quadruple in size to a $2.3 trillion market by 2032. Amazon also has a ton of potential in other areas, such as healthcare, grocery stores, neighborhood markets, and more.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Invest In: Use Your Money to Make Money\n\nSo where should you invest?

Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is the use of machines to mimic human intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do companies use AI?How do companies use artificial intelligence?AI is created through machine learning, which involves training a system with huge amounts of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about new data it\u2019s never seen.\n\n\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images with those objects are provided to the system, which \u201clearns\u201d how to detect those objects in other images. The more objects in images it detects, the more accurate the detection system becomes.Companies employ artificial intelligence in two main ways. Many tech companies use AI to make their existing operations more powerful such as through high-profile applications, including robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL  -1.3%), (GOOG  -1.38%), uses AI to filter out spam for Gmail users. Amazon (AMZN  -3.66%) uses AI to recommend products to customers, while Netflix (NFLX  -0.94%) uses AI to guide content creation and recommendations.More recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far \"generative AI\" a division of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas, has come. The potential of such large language models is enormous.Some companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology needs. These are true artificial intelligence stocks and include those listed and described below.\n\n\nTop AI stocks to buy in 2023Top AI stocks to buy in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\nAI Focus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n\nGraphics chips and self-driving cars\n\n\n\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM)\n\n\nAugmenting human intelligence across industries\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\n\nMemory chips for data centers and self-driving cars\n\n\n\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\n\nVoice-activated technology, cloud computing, and e-commerce\n\n\n\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI)\n\n\nUses software-as-a-service to provide enterprise-scale AI applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Nvidia1. Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading graphics chip company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its graphics cards becoming the de facto standard in data centers around the world. Machine learning\u2019s training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, requires less. Graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well.Nvidia\u2019s data center business represents a steadily increasing share of the company\u2019s total revenue and topped its gaming segment in revenue in fiscal 2022. This segment isn\u2019t all AI-related -- Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards are used to accelerate a wide variety of data center applications. But AI is one of the driving forces behind the company\u2019s growth.Its chips are popular for demanding workloads that applications like large language models require, and the company just launched a new set of inference platforms specifically designed for generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI\n\n\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) where computer systems create new content.\n\n\n\n\nSelf-driving cars are another area of focus. Nvidia develops platforms, including hardware and software, that can power driver-assistance features, as well as fully autonomous driving.A self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require a tremendous amount of computing power, and that\u2019s exactly what Nvidia\u2019s platform delivers.Its professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has a lot of potential in AI.Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but for now, the company is in an enviable position.\n\n\n2. IBM2. IBM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis legacy tech company is an integrated provider of hardware, software, and services to large enterprise customers. Its mainframe computer systems are still ubiquitous in certain industries, and it regularly signs multi-year technology deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.IBM\u2019s strategy with AI is to apply the technology in ways that augment human intelligence, increase efficiency, or lower costs. In the healthcare industry, IBM\u2019s AI technology is being used to create individualized care plans, accelerate the process of bringing new drugs to market, and improve the quality of care, though it sold off its Watson Health business in early 2022. In the financial services industry, via the company\u2019s 2016 acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, IBM is using AI to help clients with the daunting task of financial regulatory compliance.While the market for AI products and services is fragmented, IBM is leading the industry. Market research firm IDC ranked IBM as the leader in AI software platforms with a 13.7% market share in 2020, up 46% from the prior year.IBM is a complicated company undergoing transformation, and AI is far from its only growth opportunity. But if you\u2019re looking to invest in a company that is well-positioned to benefit from the AI boom, IBM is a good choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Microsoft3. Microsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has gotten a lot of buzz of late thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft began investing in the tech start-up in 2019, and recently put another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine, powered by ChatGPT, and the company is racing to incorporate GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Bing.CEO Satya Nadella has said repeatedly that he sees AI as the next major computing platform, and the $10 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of its conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition in order or get left behind as it did with mobile.Microsoft is also harnessing the power of AI in other ways, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs, and using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools.4. Amazon4. Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps no company is using AI more widely than Amazon. Founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos has been an evangelist for AI and machine learning. Although Amazon started as an online retailer, technology has always been at the company\u2019s core.Today, Amazon uses artificial intelligence for everything from Alexa, its industry-leading voice-activated technology, to its Amazon Go cashierless grocery stores, to Amazon Web Services Sagemaker, the cloud infrastructure tool that deploys high-quality machine learning models for data scientists and developers.Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business is also built on AI since algorithms run its top-flight recommendation engines for e-commerce and video and music streaming. In addition, Amazon uses AI to determine product rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Bedrock\n\n\nAmazon Bedrock is a service for building generative AI applications on Amazon\u2019s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services.\n\n\n\n\nEven Amazon\u2019s logistics operations benefit from its AI prowess, which helps with scheduling, rerouting, and other ways to improve delivery accuracy and efficiency. Drone delivery, which the company has long sought to implement, would be yet another AI application for the tech giant.It\u2019s difficult to quantify the impact of AI on Amazon\u2019s business, but it\u2019s clearly a key component of the company\u2019s competitive advantage. Throughout its history, Amazon has been at the forefront of emerging technologies such as e-commerce, e-books, cloud computing, video streaming, and voice-activated technology. AI provides much of the infrastructure that helps the company move into new businesses quickly and effectively.5. C3.ai5. C3.ai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC3.ai may be the closest thing on the stock market to a pure-play AI stock, as the \u201cai\u201d in the company\u2019s name and its ticker might indicate. While the companies on the list above are diversified tech giants or chip makers that have some businesses involved with AI, artificial intelligence is the entire focus of C3.ai.C3.ai is a SaaS company whose software allows companies to deploy large AI applications. The company\u2019s tools help its customers accelerate software development and reduce cost and risk, and they have a wide variety of applications. For example, the U.S. Air Force uses C3 AI Readiness to predict aircraft systems failures, identify spare parts, and find new ways to increase mission capability. European utility company Engie (ENGIY  -1.81%) is using C3 AI to analyze energy consumption and reduce energy expenditures.It's also launching its own generative AI suite with enterprise search as the first product. Enterprise search allows customers to use a natural language interface to locate and retrieve relevant data across all of the enterprise's information systems.C3.ai is the first mover in its industry and says it isn\u2019t aware of an end-to-end enterprise AI development platform in direct competition with it. That unique positioning could make the company a big winner over the long term, although the AI SaaS market is evolving and could attract competition from big cloud infrastructure such as Amazon or Microsoft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\nMachine learning is a technique by which artificial intelligence programs are trained.\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning stocksMachine learning stocksAll of the stocks above use machine learning technologies, but if you\u2019re looking for more options, here are two others worth considering:Alteryx (AYX  -2.04%) is a provider of data analytics software that empowers data workers to solve problems with a wide range of analytics and data science tools. Its Alteryx Intelligence Suite, one of several products, offers machine learning capabilities, including automated modeling and natural language processing to build models.DocuSign (DOCU  -0.5%), an AI-powered leader in digital signature software, has made significant inroads into machine learning in recent years. In 2020, the company acquired Seal Software, an enterprise contract analytics company that uses machine learning for organizing and identifying risks and opportunities in contracts. For years, DocuSign has been building machine learning tools such as DocuSign Insight to help with contract analysis through natural language processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Learning\n\n\nDeep learning, an advanced branch of AI, finds patterns in data, aiding predictions.\n\n\n\n\nDeep learning stocksDeep learning stocksDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It\u2019s the most advanced kind of artificial intelligence and is crucial in technologies such as self-driving cars. Deep learning is making advances in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary, and it differs from machine learning in that it doesn\u2019t require human inputs.Among the companies closely associated with deep learning are Nvidia, whose GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.Alphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\n\n\nAI is a growth businessAI is a growth businessTotal spending on AI systems is forecast to reach $97.9 billion in 2023, up from $37.5 billion in 2019. For the five-year period ending in 2023, the AI sector is predicted to grow at an annualized rate of 28.4%.With the AI market already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI.

It's also passed high-level exams for law school, medical licensing, and MBA programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is the use of machines to mimic human intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty images\n\n\n\nUsing a simple chat interface, ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, is able to answer questions directly and is as easy to use as Google Search. The free AI chat interface signed up 100 million users in just two months after its launch on Nov. 30, 2022, and has the potential to disrupt industries from internet search to content creation.In this article, we'll discuss the implications for ChatGPT and robot chat more generally, how you can get exposure to it as an investor, and whether you should invest in ChatGPT.\n\n\nHow to invest in ChatGPTHow to invest in ChatGPT\n\n\nChatGPT isn't publicly traded, and OpenAI, the company that built it, isn't either. However, there are a number of ways to get exposure to ChatGPT.The most direct one is through Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%). Microsoft has had a strategic partnership with OpenAI since 2019, and has invested billions of dollars into the AI start-up over its history. After ChatGPT was unveiled in early 2023, Microsoft invested $10 billion into OpenAI, showing both the company's confidence in OpenAI's potential and its belief that artificial intelligence is the next major computing platform.Another way to get exposure to ChatGPT is through NVIDIA (NVDA  -2.83%). NVIDIA is one of the world's most valuable semiconductor companies, and the leading producer of graphics processing units. Its GPUs are often used for artificial intelligence purposes, training large language models like ChatGPT and processing large amounts of data. They are a key component in many machine learning models.\n\n\nFinally, Perion Network (PERI  -3.4%) is another potential winner from the ChatGPT rollout. Perion is a small-cap ad tech stock, but it has a strategic partnership with Microsoft's Bing search engine, and Microsoft is rolling out a new version of Bing, powered by ChatGPT. If Bing gains market share on Google with the help of ChatGPT, Perion is likely to be a big winner.\n\n\n\nData source: Company websites and YCharts. Market cap data as of Sept. 18, 2023.\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nTicker\n\n\nMarket Cap\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\n(NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\n\n$2.44 trillion\n\n\nDiversified global tech giant\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n\n$1.09 trillion\n\n\nLeading maker of a graphics chips\n\n\n\n\nPerion Network\n\n\n(NASDAQ:PERI)\n\n\n$1.53 billion\n\n\nA small-cap ad tech company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Microsoft1. Microsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is best known as a diversified global tech giant. It makes money from everything from its Windows operating systems, to its Azure cloud infrastructure service, to subscription software products like its Office software suite, as well as hardware like Surface, gaming products under Xbox, and the LinkedIn professional social network.However, more recently, Microsoft has been getting attention for its strategic partnership with OpenAI. The company has bet big on OpenAI and ChatGPT. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called AI the next major computing platform, and has already leveraged the power of ChatGPT and OpenAI's tools in a number of products, including Azure.Microsoft's biggest bet with ChatGPT is on Bing, and Nadella has said that a new search engine race is happening. He's also eager to take the fight to Alphabet's Google (GOOGL  -1.3%)(GOOG  -1.38%). Nadella views the landscape in search as asymmetric, with Alphabet unable to afford losing market share in search, and any gain being a win for Bing.If you're looking for the company that's most closely connected with OpenAI and ChatGPT, Microsoft is your best choice. However, the company is so big that only a small amount of the business is exposed to ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. NVIDIA2. NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA stock has taken off over the last decade as its graphics processing chips have become a vital part of everything from gaming to self-driving cars to artificial intelligence.AI comes with extraordinary computing demands, and NVIDIA's chips are able to handle the workload better than its competitors.For example, UBS (UBS  -2.09%) estimates that 10,000 NVIDIA graphics processing units were used to train ChatGPT, and some analysts estimate that 30,000 of its GPUs are now being used to run OpenAI's chatbot.NVIDIA has also teamed up with Microsoft to build a massive cloud AI computer using tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs and other NVIDIA AI software tools.Given NVIDIA's strength in AI computing power, including products like the Omniverse, NVIDIA looks like a good AI stock to own if you're looking for an investment poised to make gains from the growth in artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Perion Network3. Perion Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to get exposure to ChatGPT is through Perion Network (PERI  -3.4%), a small-cap ad tech firm. Perion is best known for its intelligent hub, which connects advertisers and publishers to optimize ad placement and inventory for both parties.However, the company also brings in almost half of its revenue through search, largely through its partnership with Bing. Perion is one of the ad tech companies the Microsoft search engine uses to help to optimize ads and conversions. Perion gets revenue share through Bing when a user click on an ad leads to a sale.In its recent earnings presentation, Perion shared a quote from Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, who said that each additional percentage of market share that Bing gets translates to almost $2 billion in annual revenue, meaning that it wouldn't take much to move the needle for Perion.Considering the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17, the stock could soar if the new Bing begins to gain traction.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Quantum Computing Stocks\n\nAn in-depth look at the best quantum computing stocks in the U.S stock market this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Cloud Computing Stocks\n\nMoving operations to the cloud is the way of the future for many companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in a Quantum Computing ETF\n\nQuantum computing is becoming increasingly affordable and effective to the point that there's now a quantum computing ETF.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now\n\nChips are the building blocks of the technology we use every day.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you invest in ChatGPT?Should you invest in ChatGPT?ChatGPT and generative AI have the potential to change everything from the way we work to the way we learn and are entertained.It's still very early for ChatGPT and the next iteration of AI, and some are even asking if ChatGPT is safe to use since the product is new and has only just started to be monetized. Additionally, the hype around AI stocks has surged in recent months, leading shares of AI stocks like C3.ai (AI  -2.96%) and anything else connected to artificial intelligence to soar.However, for risk-seeking investors, it's not a bad idea to invest some of these ChatGPT stocks. Microsoft seems like the most stable bet of the bunch; the company has a wide range of products to make use of the AI chatbot and its partnership with OpenAI will help it benefit from future advances in generative AI technology.NVIDIA should also be a winner since it's likely to benefit from increased demand for computing power, and Perion Network stock has a lot of upside potential if the new Bing begins to catch on.Although the tech stock crash in 2022 may have chastened tech investors, ChatGPT has crystallized the potential of AI and is likely to kick off a new race in artificial intelligence.To hedge your bets, investing in all three of these stocks and holding them for the long term may be the best way to get exposure to ChatGPT. You can also invest in an AI ETF for broad exposure to the sector.Any new technology comes with risk for investors, but the upside potential from the new generative AI technology could be enormous.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

But how do you actually purchase those shares?\n\n\n\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\n\n\nHow do you actually buy shares of stock?How do you actually buy shares of stock?\u00a0Fortunately, the process of buying your first shares of stock online is relatively quick and easy. Here's a step-by-step guide to start your stock investing journey.1. Open a brokerage account1. Open a brokerage accountFirst, you'll need a brokerage account to buy stock. Consider two main factors when selecting an online stock brokerage:What the brokerage offers: Does the brokerage firm offer every product and service you need? Some brokerages publish excellent educational resources for new investors. Others provide access to stock research and analytical tools. Some online brokerages maintain branches where you can receive guidance in person. Perhaps other features, such as the ability to trade international stocks or buy fractional shares, are important to you.The user-friendliness of the brokerage platform: Is the brokerage's platform easy to navigate? If you want to trade using your mobile device, then the brokerage's mobile interface needs to be easy to use. Many of the largest brokerages allow you to use play money to experience their trading platforms before you invest, so try a few to decide which platform you like the most.Most major online brokerages, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW  -4.2%), Fidelity, and others, have eliminated trading commissions. For most investors, this largely takes cost out of the equation when choosing a brokerage platform.Once you've chosen a brokerage, you'll need to complete a new account application. This is typically quick and easy, but you'll need to have photo identification handy, such as a driver's license and your Social Security number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Security Number (SSN)\n\n\nA nine-digit identification number issued to United States citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents originally meant to be used exclusively to track earnings and benefits.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need your bank account information if you want to fund your new brokerage account using your checking or savings account. You can choose to open a standard brokerage account. Or, you can choose to establish an individual retirement account (IRA), which comes with some pretty nice tax advantages.Another decision you may face is whether to establish margin privilege for your new brokerage account. Having margin privilege enables you to buy stocks with money borrowed from your brokerage.To be clear, investing on margin is generally not a good idea for most investors. However, establishing margin privilege can confer some other benefits. For example, you may begin trading in your brokerage account before your deposited funds have cleared if you have margin privileges.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Decide which stocks to buy2. Decide which stocks you want to buyIn this article, we won't go to deep into the many possible methods of analyzing and selecting individual stocks to buy. However, the next step is to determine which stocks you'd like to purchase.A couple of pointers:Follow a \"buy and hold\" strategy: Only buy stocks that you want to own for many years. Don't buy a stock just because you think it will perform well over the next few weeks or months.Diversify your holdings: Don't put all of your money into just one or two stocks. Even if you're investing only a relatively small amount of money to start, diversify your portfolio by buying a few shares of several different stocks. With the advent of commission-free trading, owning the stocks of many different companies does not incur any additional expense.Learn more about how to choose which stocks to buy by checking out our comprehensive guide to investing in the stock market.\n\n\n3. Decide how much to buy3. Decide how many shares to buyTo determine how many shares you should buy, first decide how much money you want to invest in each stock that interests you and then divide this amount by the stock's current share price. You can find stock prices on your brokerage's platform by searching for either the stock's ticker symbol or the name of the company.If your brokerage trades fractional shares, you can purchase any dollar amount of a stock regardless of its share price. Only some brokerages allow you to buy or sell fractional shares. If your broker doesn't, you'd need to round down to the nearest whole number of shares to determine how many you can buy.As an example, let's say you want to invest $1,000 in Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%). You check Microsoft's share price and find that it's $330. Dividing $1,000 by this share price indicates that you can buy up to 3.03 shares. Assuming your brokerage doesn't trade fractional shares, you would purchase three shares of Microsoft stock.\n\n\n4. Choose an order type4. Choose an order typeDifferent order types exist for stock purchases. The type of order you place to buy stock specifies the conditions under which you want your broker to transact on your behalf. Placing a market order, which instructs your broker to buy the stock immediately and at the best available price, is typically the best order type for buy-and-hold investors.However, you may instead want to place a limit order. This indicates to your broker the maximum price for a stock that you're willing to pay. For example, let's say that a stock is currently trading for $20.50 per share. You want to buy it only when the price is less than $20, so you would place a limit order. Your broker would only buy shares on your behalf if the stock's price dips below $20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy Limit Order\n\n\nAn order that instructs your broker to buy a stock or other security only at or less than a specific maximum price.\n\n\n\n\n5. Place the stock order5. Place the stock order with your brokerageTo place a stock order, access the appropriate section of your brokerage's platform. Then and enter the required information.Your brokerage will typically ask for the company or stock ticker name, whether you want to buy or sell shares. You'll also enter either the dollar amount or how many shares you want.After you tap the \"place order\" button, your stock purchase should be executed in a matter of seconds (if the order type is a market order). Your portfolio should immediately update to reflect your ownership of the newly purchased shares.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Stock Market Return\n\nStock market results can vary wildly from year to year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Invest In: Use Your Money to Make Money\n\nSo where should you invest? We've got the options covered.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Invest $100 in Stocks & More\n\nYou can start your investment journey with a small sum of money. Here's what to do with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I Buy Stock Now or Wait?\n\nThe best time to buy a stock is usually yesterday, but think about the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Build your portfolio6. Build your portfolioThe final step in this process is to build out your investment portfolio. Now that you have a brokerage account and know the basics of how to buy and sell stocks, you can keep adding money to your brokerage account and investing in stocks you'd like to own for years to come.As a final thought, it can be tempting to monitor the performance of your stocks every day (especially at first). However, it's important to maintain a long-term mindset.Certainly, you can and should read quarterly reports and subscribe to news alerts. But if your stocks' prices decline somewhat, don't sell in a panic. And, if your stocks' prices rise by a few dollars, resist the urge to cash out. The best and easiest way to build wealth over time is to buy shares of great companies and hold them for as long as the companies remain great.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Schwab is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Green Thumb Industries1. Green Thumb Industries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen Thumb Industries ranks as one of the largest U.S. multi-state cannabis operators. It owns over 80 retail cannabis stores in 15 states across the U.S. and operates 18 manufacturing facilities. Green Thumb also holds enough additional licenses to roughly double the number of its retail locations.The company has been profitable on an annual basis since 2020. It continues to deliver revenue growth and maintains a strong balance sheet even with macroeconomic and cannabis industry headwinds. Green Thumb should have plenty of growth potential over the long term as the U.S. cannabis market expands.For now, Green Thumb's shares can only be bought and sold on over-the-counter (OTC) markets in the U.S. But if federal cannabis restrictions are lifted, the stock could be listed on major U.S. stock exchanges. This would almost certainly be a huge catalyst for Green Thumb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver-the-Counter (OTC)\n\n\nOTC is short for \u201cover the counter.\u201d OTC securities trade through decentralized networks instead of a major exchange.\n\n\n\n\n2. Cresco Labs2. Cresco Labs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCresco Labs, like Green Thumb, is based in Illinois. It operates retail cannabis stores in 10 states, including six of the most populated states in the U.S. Cresco is the top wholesaler of branded cannabis products in the U.S.The company is growing rapidly through acquisitions and opening new retail locations. Cresco's pending acquisition of Columbia Care (CCHWF  -4.76%) will make it the largest multi-state operator based on revenue. The acquisition is moving forward with overwhelming approval by Columbia Care shareholders and a thumbs-up from the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Cresco and Columbia Care are divesting some operations to satisfy regulators. Once the deal closes, Cresco will operate in 18 U.S. markets, including 12 states with annual cannabis sales of more than $1 billion.Like Green Thumb, Cresco Labs' shares can currently only be traded on OTC markets in the U.S. The stock will likely be a big winner if the Biden administration moves forward with federal marijuana reforms that allow U.S. stock exchanges to list the shares of cannabis companies that operate in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Innovative Industrial Properties3. Innovative Industrial Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. cannabis companies can't easily secure capital from banks or financial institutions since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIP) helps to solve the cash shortage for growing marijuana companies. It buys properties owned by U.S. medical cannabis operators and leases the properties back to them. The sale to IIP provides the cannabis operator with much-needed cash, and the lease agreements create a steady revenue stream for IIP.Innovative Industrial Properties has grown significantly in recent years and now owns properties in 19 states. The company continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth even with some of its tenants facing financial challenges. Because IIP is organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT), it returns at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders.In some ways, IIP wouldn't be helped as much by federal cannabis reform as other companies. Its shares already trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). If traditional banking services were available to U.S. cannabis operators, IIP could face increased competition. However, federal reforms would likely cause the U.S. cannabis market to expand -- which should work in IIP's favor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nRevenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered.\n\n\n\n\n4. GrowGeneration4. GrowGeneration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowGeneration is another ancillary provider, and the largest specialty retail chain focused on the cannabis market. It operates over 60 stores in 18 states. Because the company's business doesn't violate any existing federal marijuana laws, its stock can trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange without any issues.Demand for the company's hydroponics products has fallen due to an oversupply of cannabis in the U.S. This has caused short-term headwinds for GrowGeneration that are likely to continue in 2023. However, the company's long-term prospects remain bright, and GrowGeneration should be in a position to significantly rebound when market conditions improve.5. Scotts Miracle-Gro5. Scotts Miracle-Gro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro is facing the same supply-and-demand market dynamics as GrowGeneration. Like GrowGeneration, its shares can be traded on a major stock exchange (in this case, the NYSE) since Scotts doesn't violate any federal marijuana laws.The company's Hawthorne Gardening subsidiary ranks as a leading supplier of hydroponic gardening products to the cannabis industry. Hawthorne should have a significant growth runway over the long term despite some near-term challenges.Although Hawthorne Gardening has been a primary growth driver for Scotts, the company still generates the majority of its total revenue from consumer lawn and garden products. Higher commodity prices are currently squeezing margins for the business. However, the company's consumer lawn and garden products provide a relatively steady counterbalance to its cannabis supply unit.6. Jazz Pharmaceuticals6. Jazz Pharmaceuticals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIreland-based Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired the cannabis-focused biotech company GW Pharmaceuticals in May 2021. GW's drug Epidiolex is the first cannabis-based medicine to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Epidiolex, which treats two forms of childhood epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex (a rare disease where benign tumors grow on organs), has been a big commercial success, with sales of $736.4 million in 2022.Jazz is currently evaluating Epidiolex in a late-stage clinical study as a treatment for patients with epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures. Its pipeline also features other cannabis drugs in phase 2 testing, targeting autism spectrum disorders and related issues. In addition to its cannabis products, Jazz markets sleep-disorder and cancer drugs.\n\n\nA brief overview of the marijuana industryLet\u2019s cover some of the basics you need to know before investing in marijuana stocks.The marijuana industry is divided into three broad categories. Marijuana growers and retailers cultivate and package cannabis products and sell them to consumers. Biotechnology companies develop and market cannabis-based pharmaceutical drugs. Ancillary marijuana businesses provide products and services to cannabis companies without touching the plant.Cannabis can be medical or recreational. Medical cannabis patients use cannabis or cannabis extracts to treat health conditions and have recommendations or cannabis prescriptions from physicians. Recreational cannabis users purchase marijuana or cannabis extracts purely for enjoyment and must be 18 and older and living in a jurisdiction where recreational use of the plant is legal.Geography matters. Medical cannabis is legal in many more countries than recreational cannabis. In the U.S., cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. However, a growing number of states have legalized medical and\/or recreational cannabis. And -- as mentioned earlier -- the Biden administration is taking some steps that could lead to federal decriminalization of marijuana. The rapid growth of the U.S. cannabis market is translating into impressive growth by U.S.-based cannabis companies, while marijuana companies in Canada -- where the plant is already fully legal nationwide -- are expanding more slowly. Canada is one of the global legal markets where supply is outpacing demand and leading to falling cannabis prices.\n\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on marijuana stocksThe COVID-19 pandemic affected nearly every part of the global economy, including the cannabis industry. In many U.S. states, cannabis dispensaries were designated as essential businesses. Cannabis sales boomed in some states during the first few months of the coronavirus outbreak, driven in part by more time spent at home and increased anxiety. Marijuana growers and retailers benefited, as did ancillary providers selling gardening supplies and other products to these companies.However, not all cannabis companies fared well in the pandemic. Recreational cannabis retailers in tourist destinations such as Las Vegas saw their customer traffic dwindle, causing some of these dispensaries to start focusing on home delivery. In the medical segment, people delayed doctor visits, causing new patient starts to drop. Biotech companies experienced logistical challenges that affected sales and research progress.To a large extent, the worst appears to be over for the cannabis market with respect to COVID-19, but some effects are still being felt.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Pharmaceutical Stocks\n\nThe makers of the medicines that keep us happy and healthy can be great places to invest.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Genomics Stocks\n\nThese companies study genes and their functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in the Best Healthcare Stocks\n\nHealthcare is a universal need. Companies in this broad-based sector can produce healthy returns.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Psychedelic Stocks\n\nIt turns out that \"magic mushrooms\" may have medical applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you buy marijuana stocks?Just because there's a trendy new sector with lots of press and potential growth doesn't mean you need to invest in it. If you buy broad-based index funds, you're covered no matter which sectors of the stock market do well. Conservative investors who prefer lower risk are likely better off avoiding investing in marijuana stocks.Most of the marijuana stocks mentioned above have fallen significantly over the past 12 months. This pattern underscores the risks that investors face and highlights why using margin to buy these stocks should be avoided. However, the factors causing poor performance (especially a supply-demand imbalance) should be resolved over time.Aggressive investors with high risk tolerances, though, will probably find a lot to like about marijuana stocks. The cannabis industry is still in its early stages. The market opportunities are enormous, especially as more U.S. states legalize cannabis. Investing in these stocks is a high-risk but potentially high-reward proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Speights has positions in Innovative Industrial Properties.

Vanguard 500 Index Fund1. Vanguard 500 Index Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanguard created the index fund. If you're looking for an S&P 500 index fund, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is hard to beat.It offers a dirt-cheap expense ratio of just 0.03%. That compares to a 0.78% average expense ratio for similar funds. This lower expense ratio means investors will pay just $3 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested with the fund, versus $78 in a typical competing fund.The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs (third in assets under management, or AUM). The ETF's low-cost and large-size combination makes it a great choice if you're looking to invest in the broader market. Because of its history, diversification, and exposure to blue chip stocks, many investors consider it one of the best ETFs to buy and hold.The S&P 500 has an excellent track record of delivering returns for investors. Over the last 50 years, the average stock market return as measured by the S&P 500 is 9.4%, with dividends reinvested. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a low-cost way to capture the market's returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Invesco QQQ Trust2. Invesco QQQ Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for exposure to big tech stocks, Invesco QQQ Trust is an excellent choice. The ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes 100 of the Nasdaq's largest non-financial companies.The top stocks in the ETF are Apple (AAPL  -0.78%), Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%), and Amazon (AMZN  -3.66%). It also boasts an affordable expense ratio of 0.2%. It's one of the best-performing ETFs over the past decade. The Invesco QQQ Trust has generated a total return of more than 450% (17.6% annually), easily outpacing the S&P 500 at 220% (12.6% annually).The Nasdaq 100 suffered from a challenging bear market for most of 2022 but rallied sharply through mid-2023. Growth stocks tend to rise faster than the overall market in the early stages of a bull market.\n\n\n3. Vanguard Growth ETF3. Vanguard Growth ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth stock investors had been licking their wounds for much of 2022. That\u2019s because rising interest rates pressure growth stocks since they make the discount rate rise in financial models.If that downturn made you tired of trying to pick a growth stock winner when so few were delivering gains, you might want to invest in the Vanguard Growth ETF. The ETF holds large-cap growth stocks and tracks the CRSP US Large-Cap Growth Index. Like the Invesco QQQ Trust and the Vanguard 500 Index, the Vanguard Growth ETF's biggest holdings are Apple and Microsoft. In addition, the growth-focused ETF holds many other growth stocks among its roughly 240 holdings.The Vanguard Growth ETF offers a rock-bottom expense ratio of just 0.04%. Its low cost makes it a good deal for anyone looking for a growth stock ETF.\n\n\n4. iShares Core SP Small-Cap ETF4. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF provides broad exposure to small-cap stocks. Small caps tend to be more volatile than the broader market since they may not be profitable or as well-capitalized as their large-cap counterparts. As a result, small caps tend to be more at risk during a downturn because they may not have the same access to capital.The ETF helps mute some of that risk by owning a large basket of small caps. It held more than 600 stocks as of mid-2023. It has a fairly low concentration of holdings. Its top 10 holdings made up about 7.2% of the total.The ETF has a very low expense ratio, making it a low-cost way to add some small-cap exposure to your portfolio.\n\n\n5. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF5. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend stocks are great long-term investments. Over the last 50 years, dividend-paying companies have outperformed the broader market (9.2% average annual total return versus 7.7% for an equal-weighed S&P 500 Index). The best performance came from dividend growers and initiators (10.2% versus 6.6% for companies with no change in their dividend policy).The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF provides exposure to U.S. stocks with a history of growing their dividends. It held almost 450 dividend stocks as of mid-2023.The ETF offers a relatively attractive dividend yield. As of mid-2023, it had a trailing 12-month yield of 2.6%, more than the 1.5% dividend yield of an S&P 500 Index Fund. Thanks to its low expense ratio of 0.08%, investors get to keep more of the dividend income that the ETF produces. In addition, the fund should deliver price appreciation as the underlying companies grow their earnings and increase their dividends.\n\n\n6. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF6. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the S&P 500 is considered a broad-market index, it only gives you exposure to 500 large-cap U.S. stocks. If you want to own all of the stocks on the U.S. market, the best way to do it is with a total stock market fund such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF. The fund holds roughly 4,000 stocks, including large caps, mid caps, and small caps. Because its holdings encompass the S&P 500, its largest holdings are the same as the broad market index.Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF aims to track the CRSP US Total Stock Market Index. Like other Vanguard funds, it has a low expense ratio of 0.03%, making it an affordable way to invest in the entire U.S. stock market through one ETF.\n\n\n7. iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF7. iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it's international markets you want, the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF is a good way to go. The fund derives its holdings from an MSCI global index and then subtracts the U.S. listings. It has roughly 4,300 stocks, including large caps, mid caps, and small caps from around the world.The ETF offers diversified international exposure. The fund's top five holdings as of mid-2023 were:Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -2.56%): The Taiwanese information technology company makes up 1.6% of the fund's holdings.Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY): The Swiss consumer staples company comprises 1.2% of the ETF's holdings.ASML Holdings (ASML  -1.99%): The Netherlands-based semiconductor company makes up 1.1% of the fund's holdings.Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF): The Korean electronics company makes up 1% of the fund's holdings.Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY): The Chinese communications company makes up 1% of the ETF's holdings.The fund allows investors to invest globally at an affordable expense ratio of 0.07%. It also had an attractive dividend yield of 2.3% as of mid-2023, based on dividend payments over the last 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor\n\n\nA semiconductor is a basic element or compound substance that conducts electricity in certain situations.\n\n\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Invest in ETFs for Beginners\n\nExchange-traded funds let an investor buy lots of stocks and bonds at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nETF vs. Index Fund: What Are the Differences?\n\nYour investment style can dictate which kind of fund is best for your portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) ETFs in 2023\n\nIt may be smart to consider investing in one of these artificial intelligence-oriented ETFs.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Electric Vehicle ETFs\n\nWith the auto world switching to EVs, these exchange-traded funds can drive value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre ETFs right for you?Are ETFs right for you?Exchange-traded funds can work for almost any kind of investor regardless of your investing style or the type of stocks you're looking to invest in.There are hundreds of ETFs available that offer exposure to a wide range of sectors, as well as different kinds of investing goals such as dividends or growth. These funds can avoid some of the risk and volatility of investing in individual stocks at a very low cost. They're also a good idea if there's a sector you want to invest in but don't know well enough to pick individual stocks.For most investors, holding at least one or two ETFs makes sense, especially if you want to eliminate some of the work of picking individual stocks. The list above offers a good start if you're looking for some of the best ETFs to buy.\n\n\n\nBuying ETFs FAQs\n\n\nWhat is the best ETF to buy into?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nThere are many good ETFs to buy. The best one for you to buy depends on your personal situation and risk tolerance. However, a smart strategy is to buy ETFs with a low ETF expense ratio focused on roughly matching the performance of a stock market index like the S&P 500. A good option is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.\n\n\n\n\nWhich ETF has the best returns?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAccording to ETFdb.com, the ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF has had the best returns. Over the last five years, this ETF has delivered a 33.6% annualized total return. This leveraged ETF provides two times the daily return of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index. While this ETF showcases the power of leverage (it can produce higher returns in a rising market), it's also a higher-risk investment since that leverage can significantly affect returns during a down market.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the fastest-growing ETF?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nThe First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF is the fastest-growing ETF based on assets under management (AUM). The ETF has increased its AUM from $6 million at the start of 2022 to $791 million as of mid-2023 -- a 12,166% increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Fidelity has the lowest costs, with a 0.015% expense ratio. Schwab's is only slightly higher at 0.02%, while the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares has a 0.04% expense ratio.Fidelity and Schwab offer their index funds with no minimum investment, making them very accessible to beginning investors. Meanwhile, Vanguard has a relatively low minimum investment of $3,000.Vanguard also offers an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on investing in the 500 companies that comprise the S&P 500 index. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO  -1.34%) has a low minimum investment of one share ($415 as of March 14, 2023) and a low expense ratio of 0.3%.

The S&P 500 outperformed each fund slightly, as would be expected when accounting for each fund's expense ratio.At the S&P 500's rate of return, a $10,000 investment made five years ago would have grown into $17,866 by mid-2023. For comparison, a $10,000 investment in the Fidelity 500 Index Fund would have grown to $17,855 over the same five-year period, with that slight variation due to fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\nReturns are the difference between the initial price of an asset and the dollar value that has been generated after ownership has ended.\n\n\n\n\nWith any of these three funds, you can expect your investment to deliver a performance that's virtually identical to the S&P 500, less fees. Given its lower expense ratio, Fidelity's S&P 500 index fund will likely continue to slightly outperform the funds from Schwab and Vanguard over the longer term.\n\n\nWhy are SP 500 index funds popular?Why are S&P 500 index funds popular?An index fund is designed to mirror the performance of a stock index. An S&P 500 index fund invests in each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC). It doesn't try to outperform the index. Instead, it uses the index as its benchmark and aims to replicate its performance as closely as possible.S&P 500 funds are by far the most popular type of index fund. But index funds can be based on practically any financial market, investing strategy, or stock market sector.\u00a0Index funds are popular with investors for a number of reasons. They offer easy portfolio diversification, with some funds providing broad exposure to hundreds or even thousands of stocks and bonds. You don't risk losing all your money if one company collapses like you could with individual investments. However, you also don't have as much upside potential to the astronomical returns that can result from picking a single huge winner.Index funds are passively managed, which means you're not paying for someone to actively pick and choose investments. Passively managed funds result in a lower expense ratio from lower investment management fees compared to actively managed funds.Your money will track the market's performance. Historically, the S&P 500's annual returns have been in the 9% to 10% range. In some years, the index will lose value. For example, during the Great Recession, the S&P 500 lost about half of its value. Meanwhile, the index experienced a bear market starting in early 2022, declining by more than 20% from its peak by the fall. But over the long term, it's always recovered. A 20-year investment has never resulted in a loss in the S&P 500's history.You keep more of your investment profits in your pocket. S&P 500 index funds are low-cost investments. While active managers are likely to match or even beat the market's performance over time, their fees eat away at your returns. Because they're passive investments with low fees, S&P 500 index funds deliver returns that mirror the index's returns over the long term.You're investing in 500 of the most profitable companies in the U.S. The corporations represented in the S&P 500 are subject to stringent listing criteria. To join the index, a company must have a $14.6 billion market capitalization, and the sum of its past four quarters' earnings must be positive. Each company must also get approval from an index committee. The S&P 500's largest holdings include Apple (AAPL  -0.78%), Amazon (AMZN  -3.66%), Microsoft(MSFT  -2.61%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  0.12%).You can put your investment decisions on autopilot. The S&P 500 has a flawless track record of delivering profits over long holding periods, allowing you to invest without worrying as much about stock market fluctuations. You also don't have to research or follow individual companies. You can simply budget a certain amount and automatically invest it on a regular schedule. This practice is known as dollar-cost averaging. Even if you do pick individual stocks, S&P 500 funds are a good foundation for your investment portfolio since you're guaranteed the returns of the stock market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex Funds vs Mutual Funds: What are the Differences?\n\nIndex funds and mutual funds both pool investors\u2019 money to buy many different securities.

Leveraged ETFs use borrowed money and\/or derivative securities to amplify investment returns or to bet against the index. For example, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF aims to return twice the index's performance each day. So if the index rises by 2%, the ETF's value rises by 4%. If the index falls by 3%, the ETF loses 6%.These leveraged products are intended to be day-trading instruments and have an inherent downside bias over the long term. In other words, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF over the long term will not return twice the index's performance.Investing in S&P 500 index funds is one of the safest ways to build wealth over time. But leveraged ETFs -- even those that track the S&P 500 -- are highly risky and don't belong in a long-term portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nFAQs on S&P 500 index funds\n\n\nWhat is the best S&P 500 index fund?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAll S&P 500 index funds strive to match the returns of the S&P 500 index less fees. Since fees are the difference-maker in returns, the Fidelity 500 Index Fund stands out as the best S&P 500 index fund because it has the lowest expense ratio of the top funds.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I buy an S&P 500 index fund?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nYou can buy an S&P 500 index fund (or a similar exchange-traded fund on the S&P 500) at most brokerage accounts.

It is the bedrock benchmark for the stock market comprising the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies. Over the last 30 years, the S&P 500 has delivered a compound average annual growth rate of 10.7% per year.

The only waste product is water vapor, making it a cleaner energy source than fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal.\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe drawback to hydrogen as a fuel source is that it\u2019s rarely found in an easily extractable form like natural gas. And although hydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, most methods emit greenhouse gases. On top of that, it\u2019s not yet made at the scale needed to be economically competitive with fossil fuels.However, that could change in the coming years. Several companies are working hard to tap into the enormous promise of this potentially emission-free fuel.\n\n\nInvesting in hydrogenWhat to know about investing in hydrogenThere are several ways to produce hydrogen. Some methods result in the production of carbon dioxide as a byproduct. For example, the industry describes hydrogen obtained from burning natural gas as \"blue hydrogen.\" Using this form of hydrogen would require carbon capture and storage to trap and store the associated carbon dioxide underground to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.Another method uses renewable energy to power an electrolyzer that splits hydrogen from water molecules. This process produces \"green hydrogen,\" which results in no carbon emissions. Green and blue are two of the many colors used to classify hydrogen by its production method and emissions profile.Hydrogen fuel cells work much like batteries by generating electricity from an electrochemical reaction. Instead of being recharged like a traditional battery, hydrogen fuel cells are refueled with more hydrogen. We can use hydrogen fuel cells to motorize vehicles (cars, trains, buses, maritime vessels, and trucks) and as a stationary power source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits\n\n\nCarbon credits are tradeable permits that grant permission to emit a specific quantity of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.\n\n\n\n\nSome advocates contend that hydrogen might eventually replace natural gas in the pipeline system with some modifications. It could then be used in power plants to generate electricity and as a fuel source for our homes. Because of its potential, some forecasts peg the future value of the clean hydrogen market to be as much as $10 trillion.\u00a0Although clean hydrogen holds great promise as a potential emissions-free fuel source, it's costly to produce. It costs about $1.50 per kilogram to produce hydrogen from natural gas and $5 per kilogram to produce clean hydrogen. The U.S. Department of Energy wants to get the cost of clean hydrogen down to $1.00 per kilogram over the next decade to make it a more competitive fuel source.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest hydrogen stocks to buyBest hydrogen stocks to buy in 2023Given the potential of clean hydrogen, a growing number of companies are getting into the sector. Many energy and industrial companies are in the early stages of exploring the possibility of hydrogen energy.However, a handful of companies are already starting to emerge as early leaders in the sector.

It's a global leader in\u00a0liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing technology and equipment. It's also one of the world's largest suppliers of merchant hydrogen and a leader in hydrogen fuel infrastructure. It has more than 100 hydrogen plants with the capacity to produce 7 million kilograms of the fuel each day.Air Products aspires to be a leader in providing solutions to the world's energy and environmental challenges through gasification, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen. It has several major hydrogen projects underway that it expects to complete in the coming years. Its $7 billion carbon-free hydrogen joint venture in Saudi Arabia is the biggest. The project would use renewable energy to produce 650 tons per day when completed in 2025. The project and others under development position Air Products to remain a leading global hydrogen energy company.2. BP2. BP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBP is a global oil and gas producer with grand lower-carbon energy ambitions. It set a goal to be a net-zero company by 2050 or earlier.Hydrogen is a crucial aspect of its strategy. BP intends to capture a 10% share of the hydrogen market in its core operating areas. That's driving it to advance hydrogen projects across the U.K., Europe, the U.S., and Australia.For example, in the U.K., it's developing plans to build that country's largest blue hydrogen production plant (H2Tesside). It's also developing HyGreen Tesside, a large-scale green hydrogen production facility. The projects could deliver 15% of the U.K.'s 2030 target for low-carbon hydrogen production.\n\n\n3. Plug Power3. Plug Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug Power is a pioneer in the hydrogen fuel cell industry. It created the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cell technology. It has deployed an industry-leading 60,000 fuel cell systems for the e-mobility market (using electric powertrain technologies to power vehicles and fleets). It's one of the world's largest hydrogen buyers and operates a leading hydrogen refueling network in North America with over 180 fueling stations.Plug Power is building an end-to-end green hydrogen network to produce, store, and deliver the fuel across North America and Europe. It expects to produce 2,000 tons of green hydrogen per day by 2030. The company's strategy of building the world's first green hydrogen ecosystem positions Plug Power as a potential category leader in this massive market opportunity.4. Bloom Energy4. Bloom Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloom Energy's mission is to make clean, reliable, and affordable energy. The company has developed the Bloom Energy Server, an electric power generation platform. It also created the Bloom Electrolyzer, using the same solid oxide technology as its Bloom Energy Server. This product can produce clean hydrogen 15% to 45% more efficiently than others on the market.Bloom Energy believes the Bloom Electrolyzer is a major leap forward for hydrogen. It hopes the technology will enable heavy industries such as steel, chemicals, cement, and glass manufacturing to decarbonize. Bloom Energy can pair its Bloom Electrolyzer with solar energy and\u00a0wind energy\u00a0to generate green hydrogen, which it can store and eventually turn back into electricity for future use.\u00a05. Linde5. Linde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinde has developed several technologies to efficiently compress and safely refuel hydrogen. It also offers technologies to lower the carbon emissions of hydrogen through carbon capture and storage.In 2023, the company agreed to invest $1.8 billion to supply clean energy to a large-scale blue ammonia plant in Texas. Linde plans to build the carbon capture infrastructure needed to sequester more than 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, offsetting the emissions of the hydrogen supplied to the plant. It signed a deal with oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM  0.17%) to transport and permanently store the captured carbon dioxide. The company expects the project to start in 2025.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Energy Stocks\n\nThe economy needs energy across sectors to run smoothly, making these companies potential buys.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Dividend Stocks\n\nGoing green is the future of energy.

The emissions-free fuel could help decarbonize heavy industry, replace natural gas, and store renewable energy, paving the way for a truly net-zero world. As such, it represents a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity.\u00a0However, hydrogen is still developing as a commercially viable fuel source. The industry needs to scale and reduce costs to become competitive with fossil fuels and other emerging technologies like battery storage. Investors might want to watch the sector for a while as they gauge which companies have the best chances of emerging as long-term winners.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nHydrogen Stock FAQs\n\n\nWhat hydrogen stock is Amazon investing in?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Amazon signed a green hydrogen supply deal with Plug Power. The agreement will provide the e-commerce giant with emissions-free fuel to power some of its fleet starting in 2025. As part of the deal, Amazon received warrants to buy up to 16 million shares in Plug Power.\n\n\n\n\nWho are the biggest green hydrogen companies?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Statista, Green Hydrogen International, Fortescue Future Industries, H2 Clean Energy, CWP Global, BP, and InterContinental Energy had the highest green hydrogen production capacity as of early 2023.\n\n\n\n\nWhich hydrogen ETF is best?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAs of mid-2023, three exchange-traded funds focused on hydrogen stocks: Global X Hydrogen ETF (NYSEMKT: HYDR), Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (NYSEMKT: HDRO), and Direxion Hydrogen ETF (NYSEMKT: HJEN). These pure-play hydrogen ETFs are very small (each has less than $40 million of assets under management). They have reasonable ETF expense ratios (between 0.3% and 0.5%) and have similar holdings (around 30 hydrogen stocks).\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew DiLallo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

However, most investors would classify it as one with a dividend yield higher than a common benchmark such as the S&P 500 index or a 10-year U.S. Treasury note. In mid-2023, the dividend yield on the S&P 500 averaged about 1.6%, while the 10-year note was around 3.7%.

AbbVie\n\n\nDrugmaker AbbVie\u00a0has had an excellent dividend track record since its spinoff from\u00a0Abbott Labs (ABT  0.06%) in 2013. From its inception through early 2023, AbbVie has increased its payout by a whopping 270%. AbbVie has carried on the dividend growth legacy inherited from Abbott by boosting its payout every year.Although AbbVie will lose its patent-protected exclusivity for the top-selling drug Humira in 2023, newer products like\u00a0Rinvoq and Skyrizi should help cushion the blow. Because of that, it's in excellent shape to keep the dividend income flowing and growing.\u00a02. AvalonBay Communities\n\n\nAs one of the largest apartment owners in the country, AvalonBay benefits from collecting steady rental income to support its high-yielding payout. The real estate investment trust (REIT) also boasts a top-tier financial profile. The company's financial strength allows it to expand its apartment portfolio by developing and acquiring new communities.While the company hasn't increased its payout every year, AvalonBay has grown its dividend at a 5% annual rate since its 1994 initial public offering (IPO), including by 3.8% in early 2023. With demand for apartments continuing to grow, the REIT should be able to keep increasing its dividend in the coming years.3. Brookfield Infrastructure\n\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure\u00a0operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure businesses focused on\u00a0utilities, transportation,\u00a0energy midstream, and data. The businesses generate relatively stable cash flow to support its growing dividend. The infrastructure stock delivered its 14th straight year of increasing its payout in early 2023.Brookfield envisions increasing its dividend at a 5% to 9% annual rate over the long term, powered by the organic growth of its existing businesses and acquisitions. The company's organic growth drivers of inflation-linked rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects should grow its funds from operations (FFO) by 6% to 9% per share over the long term. Meanwhile, future acquisitions will further pad its bottom line. The company acquired a European data center platform and a global container leasing company in 2023.4. Brookfield Renewable\n\n\nBrookfield Renewable\u00a0is a sibling company of Brookfield Infrastructure. Brookfield Corporation\u00a0(BN  -0.03%) controls both companies. This Brookfield entity focuses on\u00a0renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind, solar, and energy storage facilities. The assets generate steady cash flow backed by long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and other end users, supporting Brookfield's high-yield dividend.The company also expects to increase its payout at a 5% to 9% annual pace over the long term. Powering that forecast is its organic growth drivers \u2014 including an extensive pipeline of new renewable energy projects \u2014 plus additional acquisitions. Brookfield Renewable has already secured and funded at least 8% annual funds from operations (FFO) per share growth through 2027.5. Duke Energy\n\n\nDuke Energy is a leading utility. The company's electric utilities serve 8.2 million customers across six states, while its natural gas utilities provide gas to 1.6 million customers across five states. Its businesses generate very stable cash flows backed by government-regulated rate structures.Duke has a large-scale investment program underway to expand its transformation and distribution network. These investments should grow its earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually through 2027. The earnings growth should enable the utility to continue growing its dividend.Dividend Stocks 6-106. Crown Castle International\n\n\nCrown Castle is a REIT focused on owning communications infrastructure in the U.S., including cell towers, small cells, and fiber optic networks. Its infrastructure is crucial to supporting the mobile industry's next-generation network: 5G. Crown Castle sees a decades-long opportunity to invest in new 5G-related infrastructure. That should drive 7% to 8% annual dividend growth over the long term. It has grown its dividend payment at a 9% compound annual rate since 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. ChevronThe big oil giant's top financial priority is to sustain and grow its dividend. The company delivered its 36th consecutive annual dividend increase in 2023, one of the longest streaks among oil stocks. Chevron has grown its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate over the last 15 years. Chevron's integrated operations, low-cost oil business, and lower-carbon energy investments position it to sustain and grow its dividend in future years.8. Enbridge\n\n\nCanadian oil pipeline giant Enbridge has been an outstanding dividend stock over the years. It has paid dividends for more than 68 years, including expanding its payout in each of the past 28 years.While the world is transitioning its fuel supply from oil to cleaner alternatives, Enbridge is adapting by investing in infrastructure to support natural gas projects and offshore wind farms. The investments have the company on track to increase its cash flow per share by a mid-single-digit annual rate for the next several years, which should support continued dividend growth.\n\n\n9. Enterprise Products Partners\n\n\nEnterprise Products Partners\u00a0ranks as one of the top players in the\u00a0midstream oil and gas market. The master limited partnership (MLP) has increased its payout for almost a quarter century.While the company currently focuses on fossil fuels, it formed an evolutionary technology group in 2021 to pursue opportunities in the energy transition. The future investments should give Enterprise the fuel to continue increasing its dividend.10. Gilead Sciences\n\n\nGilead Sciences\u00a0pays one of the most attractive dividends in the biotechnology sector. The company has a solid dividend track record, increasing its payout every year since it initiated one in 2015. Its strong HIV franchise is the biotech's anchor.However, Gilead has also been able to cash in on its antiviral treatment Remdesivir, one of the few approved treatments for COVID-19. It has several other promising drugs in the pipeline that should drive continued sales growth in the future.Dividend Stocks 11-1511. Blackstone\n\n\nLeading alternative asset manager Blackstone has a unique dividend policy. The company returns almost all of its earnings to investors via dividends and share repurchases. Because of that, its dividend payment changes each quarter as its earnings fluctuate. However, the overall payment has steadily risen over the years, along with Blackstone's earnings.12. Regions Financial\n\n\nRegions Financial is one of the country's largest banks, focusing on the South and Midwest. Regions Financial has a long history of paying dividends. While the company reset its payment level during the 2008-09 financial crisis, it has increased the dividend 20-fold since that time. \u00a013. Extra Space Storage\n\n\nExtra Space Storage is a REIT focused on owning, operating, and managing self-storage facilities. The company has been one of the best-performing stocks in the REIT sector over the past decade. A big driver is its rapidly rising dividend. Extra Space Storage has increased its payout by almost 550% over the last 10 years.14. 3M\n\n\n3M has been a phenomenal dividend stock. The industrial conglomerate has paid dividends for more than a century, including increasing its payout in each of the past 65 straight years. As such, it's a Dividend King, a company with 50 or more years of consecutive dividend increases. The company's strategy of investing in new products has driven that steady growth. It has expanded its sales and enabled 3M to keep increasing its dividend.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. PfizerPfizer\u00a0has paid dividends for roughly 340 consecutive quarters. The pharmaceutical giant's investments in research and development are paying off. The company developed one of the first vaccines against COVID-19 and followed that up with a successful oral treatment. The commercial successes have enabled Pfizer to continue making research and development (R&D) investments and strategic acquisitions that should increase its cash flow in the future. Pfizer should continue to generate plenty of cash to fund future dividends.Dividend Stocks 16-2016. VICI Properties\n\n\nVICI Properties is a REIT focusing on owning experiential real estate like casinos. The company leases those properties back to operating companies under long-term triple net leases (NNN). The agreements supply it with steadily rising rental income from annual rate increases. The company also steadily invests in new gaming and non-gaming real estate. VICI Properties' growing income has enabled it to increase its dividend in all five years since its formation.17. Realty Income\n\n\nRealty Income lives up to its name. The REIT, which pays a monthly dividend, has made more than 635 consecutive payments. Even better, it has increased its payout more than 100 times since its initial public offering in 1994, expanding it at a 4.4% compound annual rate. That adds up to more than 25 consecutive years.Driving that growth has been a steady diet of acquisitions. Realty Income purchases single-tenant properties in sale-leaseback transactions, acquires larger property portfolios, and merges with other REITs to grow its portfolio, rental income, and dividend.\u00a018. Verizon Communications\n\n\nTelecommunications giant Verizon has been a great income stock over the years. The company delivered its 16th consecutive annual dividend increase in 2022, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. Verizon should be able to continue increasing its dividend as it invests to transition its mobile network to 5G, bringing faster data speeds to its customers.19. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\n\nPharmacy giant Walgreens has paid dividends for more than 90 years, expanding its payout in each of the past 47. The company expects the streak to continue. It's steadily transforming into a consumer-centric healthcare company that should accelerate its earnings growth. The strategy should enable the company to continue increasing its payout.20. W.P. Carey\n\n\nW.P. Carey is a REIT that owns a diversified real estate portfolio. The company has an excellent dividend track record and has increased its payout each year since its IPO in 1998. Behind that steady growth has been W.P. Carey's ability to steadily expand its portfolio of cash-flowing commercial real estate. With a solid financial profile, the REIT has the flexibility to keep growing in the coming years.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Dividend Stocks\n\nThese companies pay their shareholders regularly, making them good sources of income.\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Achievers List\n\nThese companies have at least 10 years of dividend growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Kings of 2023\n\nThese companies have increased their dividends every year for 50+ years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Often Are Dividends Paid on Stocks?\n\nHow often can you expect to be paid a dividend on stocks?\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat income now, more laterAll 20 of these dividend stocks offer an above-average yield, making them stand out in a time when many companies don't pay very high dividends.

And there's no annual fee.Discover it\u00ae Cash Back (see rates and fees): We think this has the highest cash back potential for cards with no annual fee.

At The Motley Fool Ascent, we do the same for credit cards and your personal finances.\n\n\n\nI've been part of The Motley Fool since 2006, helping our readers make more and save more through investing and their personal finances. I get excited about what most others find dreadfully boring. Specifically, when a credit card says \"terms apply,\" I'm actually reading those terms. All of them. I've been juggling multiple credit cards for decades to maximize rewards, and I've held credit cards on multiple continents.Of the cards we list on this page, I personally currently use or have in the past used some of them (many of my teammates at The Ascent use the others we list).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur pick for best overall credit cardChoosing a great credit card being easier than you think -- and the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is proof of that.Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae CardFlat-rate 2% cash rewards on spending$200 welcome offer (after spending $500 in first three months)No annual feeWith the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card you earn 2% cash rewards on your spending. No juggling cards, no figuring out rewards systems. You spend at the grocery store: 2%. At the vet: 2%. Paying for Netflix: 2%. It\u2019s really that easy.Better still, this card has a welcome offer of $200 after you spend $500 in the first three months of card ownership.And that's all for a card with no annual fee, meaning that as long as you pay your credit card statements in full and on time (and we suggest that you do), you'll pay no ongoing fee for owning this card and earning cash rewards with it.The perks on the card aren\u2019t as extensive as a card that carries an annual fee, but hey, we like no annual fee. Still, you do get cell phone protection of up to $600 covering damage or theft (terms apply here) and Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201cCredit Close-Up\u201d that provides your FICO score monthly (enrollment required for this one).In all, this card is proof that it doesn\u2019t need to be complicated to find a great credit card.Apply for the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card (on Wells Fargo's website)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first-hand experience\n\n\"I got this card originally for the 0% introductory APR offer and the cash-back rewards and bonus. (Editor's note: The Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card card offers 0% APR for 15 months on purchases and qualifying balance transfers; after that, the go-to 20.24%, 25.24%, or 29.99% variable APR applies.) I was taking on a home renovation project and thought that both the 0% APR period and cash rewards could help with our costs. I ended up keeping it for the cell phone protection feature.\"Rachel Zinanti, team member at The Motley Fool Ascent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2 best credit cards for balance transfers with a long 0% introductory offerIf you have credit card debt and are currently paying interest on that debt, getting a credit card with a 0% introductory balance transfer offer \u2013 or, better still, a paired 0% purchases and balance transfer offer \u2013 can give you some space from paying interest while you work down that credit card debt.Our top pick: Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card0% introductory APR for 21 months on balance transfers (after that, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR rate applies)0% introductory APR for 21 months on purchases (after that, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR rate applies)No annual feeThe Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card also makes this list because of its matching 0% introductory offers for 21 months on balance transfers and purchases. This is another card with no annual fee, which is ideal when you\u2019re trying to pay down credit card debt or generally avoid interest. But if you are thinking specifically about a balance transfer, this card does have a balance transfer fee of 5%; min: $5.One thing I do like about a lot of the Wells Fargo cards, and Wells Fargo Reflect Card has this feature as well, is the $600 in cell phone protection against damage or theft (terms apply here). It\u2019s a perk that you don\u2019t see on most cards.Apply for the Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card (on Wells Fargo's website)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nMatching 0% offers\n\nMatching 0% offers may seem nice to have, but they're more advantageous than you might guess. If you carry a balance on a credit card, you lose your grace period. The grace period is that wonderful feature that if you pay your balance in full every month, you don\u2019t accrue any interest on new purchases until after your due date. But, if you carry a balance, you lose that grace period, and new purchases begin accruing interest immediately. If you have matching 0% intro offers on balance transfers and purchases, you don\u2019t have to worry about that, because your new purchases will be interest-free thanks to the 0% offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative to this cardAlso good: Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card0% introductory APR for 21 months on balance transfers (after which the go-to regular APR applies)0% introductory APR for 12 months on purchases (followed by the same go-to rate)Balance transfer fee: 3% ($5 min) for first 4 months, then 5% ($5 min.)The Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card also offers 21 months of 0% introductory interest on balance transfers, is also a no-annual-fee card, and does not apply penalty rates for missed payments. The balance transfer fee here also gives you a bit of a break for the first four months, after which it rises. What\u2019s nice about the Citi Simplicity Card is that there is that there\u2019s also no fee for late payments \u2013 a nice complement to the no penalty rate feature. That said, we strongly recommend that you make payments on time, even with these features.Where the Citi Simplicity Card lags is the intro 0% purchase offer. That\u2019s at 12 months, which is considerably shorter than the 21 months of the balance transfer offer (again, the go-to regular APR applies to purchases after the introductory offer). Maybe not that big of a deal, especially if you\u2019re just focused on the balance transfer offer, but it\u2019s worth noting.Apply for the Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card (on Citi's website)Who shouldn\u2019t get these cardsIf you don\u2019t have credit card debt and you\u2019re not in a position where you need a period of 0% interest on new purchases, then these aren\u2019t the cards for you. Many top cards also include 0% introductory offers, which is fine. But if you don\u2019t need a 0% offer, focus on other card categories instead.Additionally, if you could benefit from a 0% interest offer, but don\u2019t need the absolute longest period of 0%, then you can typically get a better all-around card by using a shorter 0% introductory offer. And if this sounds like you, just read on \u2013 those cards are next.\n\n\n\n\nThe best 0% credit card with rewardsI tend to be strict when thinking about 0% credit cards. If you have credit card debt, focus on paying that down, worry about rewards later.You\u2019re going to save so much in interest and make your financial life so much easier by not having credit card debt hanging over you. It just makes sense to make eliminating that debt a priority.But, is there a world where you can have both? Actually, there is. If you don\u2019t have an overwhelming amount of credit card debt, then the best credit cards for rewards also offer solid 0% term lengths and welcome offers.Our top pick: Chase Freedom Flex\u21200% introductory APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (after which the go-to variable rate applies)5% cash back rewards on rotating bonus categories (activation required)$200 welcome offer (after spending $500 in the first 3 months )The Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 is a very close second. There are similar things to like: it has matching 0% intro APR offers for 15 months, a balance transfer fee of Either $5 or 5% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater. , no annual fee, a $200 welcome offer, and an attractive rewards program.The Chase Freedom Flex rewards program isn\u2019t as simple as the flat cash rewards, but some people may actually like it more. There are rotating categories each quarter like gas, grocery stores (excluding Walmart and Target), and Amazon and Lowe's. If you activate the category for your card, you earn 5% back on purchases in that category for the period that it\u2019s active. But on a regular basis, you\u2019re also earning 3% on dining at restaurants, takeout, eligible delivery services, and drugstores. And then it\u2019s 1% back on everything else.Apply for the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 (on Chase's website)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nHow do you know if a shorter 0% offer is right for you?\n\nI obviously don\u2019t know you so I can\u2019t tell you for sure. But, you can do some simple math to help figure out whether you can use a shorter 0% period and still get out of credit card debt. Just take the amount of debt you have and divide by the amount you can realistically pay towards that debt every month. That\u2019ll give the you the least number of months you\u2019ll need in the 0% offer. For example, if you have $3,000 in credit card debt and can pay $200 per month, then you would need a 0% balance transfer offer of at least 15 months (and it\u2019s even better to give yourself two to three months of cushion). The same math works if you are using a 0% on purchases offer to make a big purchase. If it's a $3,000 purchase and you can pay $200 month, then you need at least 15 months of 0% interest on purchases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho shouldn\u2019t get these cardsIf you don\u2019t have credit card debt, these could still be great cards for you. However, if you don\u2019t have a need for a 0% introductory offer, you are probably well served to look at other card categories, rather than being limited to cards that have a 0% intro offer.And if you have significant credit card debt or you just don\u2019t think that you can realistically pay down your debt in the length of time offered by these cards, then you may be better off opting for the cards with the longest 0% intro offers.\n\n\n\n\nThe 2 best credit cards for cash back rewardsOur pick for simple cash back: Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offerFlat-rate 2% cash back on spending (1% when you make a purchase and 1% when you pay your bill)No cap on the amount of cash back you can earnNo annual feeThe Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offer card is nearly as simple and worth checking out. The rewards program is just a wee bit more complicated \u2013 you get 1% cash back when you make a purchase and 1% when you pay your bill, rather than just getting the 2% all at once. But that isn\u2019t a big deal. More notable is that there\u2019s currently no welcome bonus on the card.Apply for the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offer (on Citi's website)These cards live somewhere in the Goldilocks zone between flat-rate cash back cards and travel rewards cards. They aren\u2019t as simple as flat-rate cards, nor are they as complicated as travel rewards cards. At the same time, they\u2019re potentially more rewarding than flat-rate cards, but typically a bit less so than travel cards.Before we compare credit cards, I think it\u2019s also worth noting that, like travel rewards cards, these cards will generally serve you the best when you pair them with other cards to get the most cash back across the most categories.Our top pick for tiered and bonus category cash back: Discover it\u00ae Cash Back5% cash back on rotating categories like grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations (up to quarterly maximum of $1,500; activation required)Unlimited cash back match at the end of the first yearNo annual feeLeading the pack for these cards is the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back. This card has a rotating bonus category, which means that it has a different category each quarter that earns a high 5% cash back rate on spending (up to $1,500 in purchases, and note that you have to activate the bonus category). These categories include grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations.But as good as that 5% is on its own, at the end of your first year of card ownership Discover matches all of the cash back that you've earned in that time. So after the first year of owning the card, you'll essentially have earned double that first year's rate of cash back.Spending outside of the bonus category is just 1% cash back (though remember, that gets matched 1-for-1 at the end of the first year, too), but the fact that this is a no-annual-fee card makes it pretty valuable overall, especially in year one.Apply for the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back (on Discover's website)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first-hand experience\n\n\"I've had the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back card for three years, and give it top scores across the board. Beyond the 1% cash back on every purchase, I've found the quarterly 5% cash-back offers are set up really well to help me max out the cash back benefits. The app and website are easy to use, the fraud protection is helpful, and I've only had a few merchants over these three years not accept Discover.\"Allyson Wines, Head of Marketing at The Motley Fool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2 best credit cards for racking up big travel rewardsYou can\u2019t have a list of the best credit cards of 2023 without featuring cards that can be used to rack up serious points and access quality perks. These cards take a bit of work to get the most value, but if you\u2019re willing to do that work, it can really pay off.I will note that while you can certainly use a single card from this list, if you\u2019re going the direction of rewards maximization, the best credit cards for travel typically work well when paired with other cards to get the most rewards across the most categories.Our top pick: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit CardUnlimited 2 miles per $1 spent5 miles per $1 spent on hotels and rental cars through Capital One Travel75,000 miles bonus offer (after spending $4,000 within the first 3 months)The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is our top pick and was the anchor card in my wallet for a long time. (See rates and fees.) It\u2019s simply a great card that allows you to earn a solid 2 miles per $1 spent across all of your spending, plus 5 miles per $1 on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Miles can be used to reimburse yourself for travel you\u2019ve paid for and is on your card statement. You can also use them to book travel through Capital One Travel. Or you can transfer them to Capital One travel partners like Air France KLM, British Airways, and Virgin Red.There\u2019s a $95 annual fee, but there\u2019s also an impressive 75,000 miles offer when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months of having the account. There are a number of nice perks like Capital One lounge visits, a $100 credit for TSA PreCheck, no foreign transaction fees, rental car coverage, and extended warranty coverage.I mentioned above that this used to be in my wallet. Why not anymore? It was a lifestyle change. We had kiddos enter the picture, which meant less travel, which meant less utility from the card. But this will be top of my list when that changes again, especially if it has a welcome bonus like the current one.Apply for the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (on Capital One's website)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first-hand experience\n\n\"At the time I used the Capital One Venture Card I was busy, but also traveling a lot. So it was really the perfect card because it has great travel-focused rewards and perks, but also is easy to get value from the card. We were also doing a lot of international travel at the time, and the no foreign transaction fee was crucial -- credit card was time and again the easiest way to pay in countries around the world, and getting solid exchange rates without the extra fee on top made it practical to use this card from Casablanca to Kyoto.\"Matt Koppenheffer, General Manager, The Motley Fool Ascent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso good: Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card1.5 points per dollar 25,000 points (that's 25,000 online bonus points after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening - that can be a $250 statement credit toward travel purchases)No annual feeThe Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card is proof that you can have a great travel rewards card with no annual fee.Yes, when you pay an annual fee for a travel rewards card (like the ones above) you can expect somewhat higher everyday rewards rates and certain extra perks. There's also generally a beefy welcome bonus.But with the Bank of America Travel Rewards you get a very solid 1.5 points per dollar on your everyday spending. Plus, there's a current welcome bonus of 25,000 points.And remember, if you are a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member, the rewards rate bumps up between 25% and 75%.There's also no foreign transaction fee. Which may seem obvious for a travel credit card, but some travel cards do have a foreign transaction fee (so pay attention!).Finally, though it's not the focus of this section, there is an offer of 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases and 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. So you can not only get travel rewards with no annual fee, but secure a 0% interest offer at the same time. (Note that after the 0% introductory period, the go-to rate, currently 18.24% - 28.24% (Variable), applies).I don't use this card specifically, but have a very similar Bank of America card and wouldn't give it up. Especially for those that already bank with Bank of America and qualify for Preferred Rewards, these cards have to make the list to consider.Apply for the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card (on Bank of America's website)Who shouldn\u2019t get these cardsTravel cards typically aren\u2019t set-it-and-forget-it credit cards. Many have annual fees, so you should make sure you\u2019re actually making the most of them if you\u2019re paying that fee. If you want a simple credit card experience, it\u2019s hard to say that these would be the best credit cards for you.If you want a simpler rewards experience, consider cards with simple cash-back rewards.These also tend to be heavily geared towards people who travel and dine out a lot. When I had babies enter the picture, I found that my travel cards were suddenly less valuable. They\u2019re still solid credit cards even if you\u2019re not a big traveler, but you\u2019re just not going to get as much value as someone who\u2019s traveling and eating out a lot.If you want higher rewards without less travel focus, consider tiered or bonus-category cash back cards.If you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll consistently be able to pay your credit card in full and on time every month, I wouldn\u2019t suggest focusing on this category. Paying off your credit card in full every month is always a good idea, but even more so when you\u2019re paying an annual fee and trying to maximize the value of earning rewards. Paying interest on card balances eats away very quickly at any value these cards bring.If you could benefit from 0% interest for a big purchase or to help pay down credit card debt, consider cards with long 0% APR introductory offers or cards with 0% APR intro offers and rewards.\n\n\n\n\nThe 2 best cards for building and rebuilding creditIf you have a poor credit history or have little or no credit history at all (for example, if you\u2019re still a student), qualifying for a lot of the cards on this page can be difficult, if not impossible. The good news is that there are cards that will help you build your credit and offer some nice features as well.Our top pick: Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Secured credit card3% cash back on a category of your choice and 2% on grocery stores and wholesale clubs (up to $2,500 in combined spend per quarter)Unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchasesNo annual feeClose on the heels of that card is the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Secured credit card. Here\u2019s another secured credit card that can help you build credit, but also lets you earn cash-back rewards. And the rates of cash back are generous at 3% for your choice of a category like gas, dining, or online shopping; 2% for grocery stores and wholesale clubs; and 1% everywhere else. There is a limit on the amount of spend for the 2% and 3% rewards rates, but it\u2019s a relatively high max of $2,500 per quarter.The card has no annual fee, and you get free access to your FICO score. Bank of America will periodically review accounts to see if they qualify to be bumped up out of a secured card, but they don\u2019t define specifically when that review happens. A security deposit of at least $200 is required here.Apply for the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Secured credit card (on Bank of America's website)Student cardsThough they also serve people without top-notch credit, the best student credit cards tend to be a bit of a step up from secured cards. Likely because card issuers are aiming for a good first impression to try to win lasting customers.In any case, rewards are often a bit better, there may be welcome bonuses, there\u2019s rarely a security deposit of any sort, and you might even find a 0% introductory offer.It\u2019s once again Discover and Bank of America that lead the way in this category. And once again, Discover gets our top marks.Our top pick for students: Discover it\u00ae Student Cash Back5% cash back on rotating categories like grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations (up to quarterly maximum of $1,500, activation required)Unlimited cash back match at the end of the first yearNo annual feeThe Discover it\u00ae Student Cash Back is a wonderful card in large part because it looks so much like the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back. There\u2019s no annual fee, and users earn 5% cash back in rotating categories like Amazon.com, grocery stores, and restaurants (up to the quarterly maximum of $1,500).But the best part is that Discover matches all of the cash back you've earned at the end of the first year. That effectively makes the base 1% cash back rate 2% during that first year. And the higher 5% bonus rate becomes a whopping 10%.We\u2019re financially focused, so we\u2019re not the place that\u2019s going to tell you to pick a financial product based on style. That said, the Discover it\u00ae Student Cash Back does offer a selection of nice designs, so students are not carrying something that\u2019s the same old boring blue or silver of most standard cards.Apply for the Discover it\u00ae Student Cash Back (on Discover's website)Who shouldn\u2019t get these cardsWell, this is pretty simple. If you have fair, good, or excellent credit, you will qualify for cards that are better than the secured cards and you won\u2019t have to pay a security deposit. So if that's you, you should probably check out our other categories.And, if you\u2019re not a student, well \u2026 you\u2019re not going to qualify for the best student credit cards with most issuers. Plus, again, if you have good credit, you\u2019ll likely be able to find a better card than a student card anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the best credit card for your needs\n\nCompare credit card bonuses, rewards, fees, and more using our side-by-side comparison tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart comparing cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we picked these cards (Methodology)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit cards don't end up on our list of the best credit cards by luck.\n\n\n\nThere's not a single methodology that we use to pick cards for this page. Just as the different types of cards are good fits for different types of people, a one-sized-fits-all methodology doesn't work for all of these types of cards.We break up the large field of credit cards into three main groups for the purposes of analysis and ratings:Rewards-type cards: These are standard cards (i.e. not for credit-building or students) whose primary value is in the rewards they provide. Travel rewards cards, flat-rate cash back cards, tiered cash-back cards, store credit cards, airline credit cards, and hotel credit cards are a few of the sub-types that fall into this group.0% APR introductory offer cards: These are cards where the most valuable feature is the 0% APR introductory offer. The primary groups that fall under this heading are 0% balance transfer cards and 0% purchases cards.Credit-building cards: These are cards whose main feature is that they're accessible to people who have a poor credit history or little or no credit history.We have slightly different methodologies to determine how cards get rated across each of these categories.Rewards cardsWith rewards cards we are focused on rewards (naturally). Cards score points for the overall value of their rewards program as well as the value of their welcome offer, if they have one. We ding cards for having an annual fee, and ding them more for a higher annual fee (though we'll readily note that sometimes fee-bearing cards have perks or rewards that easily make the annual fee worth it). We add more points if the card has perks that many people will get value from -- and the more valuable perks, the more we bump the score.0% APR introductory offer cardsWith these cards, the main value to users is the length of the 0% intro APR period, so we give points for longer 0% periods (both purchases and balance transfers). We also give points for matching 0% periods -- when the 0% lengths match it typically gives the user most flexibility and value. We also award cards for lower balance transfer fees, since this lowers the total cost to users who do transfer a balance. And though we don't focus on rewards or other perks when it comes to 0% cards -- the focus is using them to help avoid expensive credit card debt -- we do give cards points for good rewards programs, welcome offers, and valuable perks. Users that can pay down their debt with shorter 0% periods often do have the opportunity to choose from cards that have both the 0% introductory offer and rewards, welcome offers, and perks.Credit-building cardsThese cards also have specific usage, and that's to help the users build or re-build their credit. The main benefit off the top with these cards is that they do accept users with limited credit history or a poor credit history (though they do sometimes require a security deposit). This group includes student cards, since students often have a limited credit history, or no credit history at all. These cards are typically more stripped down, but we score these cards based on the perks and features that they do offer, which may include limited rewards systems, providing FICO credit scores, or even in some cases (mostly student cards as opposed to secured cards) 0% introductory offers.The most important part is youA five star card is only as good as how it fits into your life, financial picture and needs though. So our ratings can be a great starting point, but we also try to provide context on this page and elsewhere on our site, so you can determine how much value a given card will provide you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther helpful information about credit cardsHaven\u2019t had your fill yet?

It's less about the cards themselves, and more about you. What do you need out of this card? What are the must-haves -- and the not-under-any-circumstances?This will narrow down your credit card offers considerably, so it makes sense to do this first.\n\n\n\n\nHow to compare credit cards\n\n\n\nFigure out the features that are most important to you. This will depend on the type of card you're choosing. Let's say you need a balance transfer card. The features to look at would be the length of each card's balance transfer offer and its balance transfer fees.Check for any annual fees on the cards you're comparing. If you're stuck between two credit cards that work for you, one of them may have a cheaper annual fee.Use secondary features as your tiebreaker. These are the features that aren't quite as important but still have value. Secondary features could include sign-up bonuses or a FICO\u00ae Score for free.Read the fine print. All credit cards display common card features in a standardized format. Keep an eye out for the following fees and compare them to other cards: balance transfer, cash advance, late payment, and foreign transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of credit cards\n\n\n\nThough there are many different types of credit cards, they all fall into certain categories based on their features and rewards programs. Here are the top credit cards and credit card offers right now within each category.\n\n\n\nThe cost of a card comes in three forms: the annual fee to just have the card, the fees and penalties for missed or late payments, and the interest charges. . . Some cards have forgiveness for a single late payment. Some have no annual fee. Some charge low interest. Try to find cards that have all three.\n\nD'Arcy Becker, Ph.D., Department Chairperson and Professor of Accounting, on shoppers choosing the right card.\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel credit cardsThese cards are best suited to people who travel at least a few times per year. Many of these cards charge annual fees, so you want to make sure you're earning enough in rewards to at least make up for what you're paying to own it.With travel cards, you can redeem your points or miles for free or discounted travel. There are also quite a few top travel credit cards that offer extra perks, such as free access to airport lounges, hotel upgrades, and travel insurance. The best airline credit cards, hotel credit cards, and general travel credit cards would all fall under this category.Compare more picks: Check out The Ascent's best travel rewards credit cardsRewards credit cardsThis category includes every credit card that earns purchase rewards.

Sometimes these credit cards are accepted everywhere, but often they're only for use in-store. Store credit cards usually come with exclusive discounts and rewards that can only be used at that store. Make sure to read the fine print when you apply for a credit card, especially with any 0% intro APR offers, as they can involve deferred interest, which is tricky and can lead to hefty surprise interest charges.Opening one of these cards is best if you frequently shop at a particular retailer. But if you only shop there once or twice per year, it may not be worth it.\n\n\n\n\nDo you need a credit card?Although a credit card isn't a necessity, there are several ways it can help you financially. Our credit card guide could help you learn these important things:Improving credit: The best credit cards can help you build or rebuild your credit. When you use your credit card and pay the bill on time, your credit score will go up. This can help you qualify for financing, such as a car loan or mortgage, at a low interest rate.Earning rewards: With rewards credit cards, you can earn cash back or travel points on purchases.Fraud protection: Legally, you're only liable for up to $50 in losses if your credit card is used fraudulently. But most credit card companies go even further. Many credit cards offer zero-liability policies -- meaning you aren't responsible for any fraudulent charges. You also don't need to worry about a thief draining your bank account through your credit card (which could happen if your debit card was stolen).Extra perks and discounts: Credit cards can offer all kinds of benefits, such as extended warranty coverage on purchases or complimentary rental car insurance. Many of the best credit cards of 2023 have features that can be worth hundreds of dollars or more.\n\n\n\nExpect credit card companies to come courting you hard, with new offers, points, and rewards. But proceed with caution! There may be hidden fees, higher interest rates, or other catches. It pays to read the fine print.\n\nBill Maurer, Ph.D., Director, Institute for Money, Technology, and Financial Inclusion on current credit card trends consumers should be aware of.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should I have one credit card?You should stick to one credit card if:You want to keep your finances as simple as possible.You've never had a credit card before, or you've been using credit cards for less than a year.You've had problems with missed credit card payments or overspending.You value simplicity in managing your finances and don't want to worry about tracking multiple bills.When should I have multiple credit cards?You should carry multiple credit cards if you want more card benefits and you're confident in your ability to manage everything. There are some big advantages to having multiple cards:You can carry cards that earn more in different areas, such as one flat-rate cash back card and another with bonus categories. This is a simple way to maximize your rewards.You can use features from each of your cards and get more value overall. Instead of choosing between two of the best credit card offers, you can have both.You'll have more available credit, which helps you maintain a lower credit utilization ratio. This can result in a higher credit score.\n\n\n\n\nHow to improve your credit scoreYour credit score plays a large role in which credit cards you can get. If you have a low credit score and you work on raising it, that will open up more credit card options for you.Here's the best advice you can follow to improve your credit score.Review your credit reportYou're legally entitled to a free annual credit report from each credit bureau (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Go to AnnualCreditReport.com to request it.Once you have your credit reports, review them for errors that could be damaging your credit score. If you find any errors, visit the website of the credit bureau that issued the report to file a dispute.Get a credit cardThe easiest way to improve your credit is by using a credit card and paying the bill on time. If you don't have a credit card, look for the top credit cards aimed at consumers in your position.If you don't have much credit history yet, the best credit cards for beginners would be ideal. If you're rebuilding credit from issues on your credit history, then secured credit cards are the most suitable option.Stay below 30% of your credit limitThe amount of your credit that you use impacts your credit score. Say you have a card with a $1,000 credit limit. If the balance is $500, that would put your credit utilization ratio at 50%.A lower credit utilization helps your credit score. As a rule of thumb, aim to stay under 30% credit utilization at all times. It's good for your credit, and as an added perk, it helps you stay out of credit card debt.Follow good payment habitsLearn your credit card's due date and always make your payment on time or early. Each on-time payment improves your payment history, which is the biggest factor in your credit score. You may want to set automatic payments so you don't miss any.It's also recommended that you pay off your credit card every month. While this isn't necessary for your credit score, it's a way to avoid interest charges on your credit card purchases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Picks\n\n\n\nCard\nRating\nGreat For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Cash Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.00 stars\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

With credit cards, the APR is the same as the interest rate.Balance: The amount owed on a credit card, including all unpaid transactions and fees. The balance at the end of a statement period is called the statement balance.Balance transfer: Moving a balance from one credit card to another. This is usually done when the new card offers a lower APR. Not every credit card offers balance transfers, and many of the cards with this feature charge a balance transfer fee.Cash advance: Withdrawing cash from a credit card, most often through cash advance checks, using the card at an ATM, or by wiring money with the card. Cash advances usually have a higher APR and start accruing interest immediately, so it's a poor way to use a credit card.Credit card: A credit card is a revolving line of credit issued by a bank and connected to a revolving line of credit. The cardholder can use their credit card for purchases and possibly other types of transactions, although this depends on the card.Credit limit: The credit card's spending limit. This can vary based on the type of transaction. On credit cards that offer cash advances, there is typically a lower credit limit for cash advances than for purchases. A transaction that would exceed a card's credit limit will be declined unless the cardholder has opted to allow over-the-limit transactions (and any potential fees that come with them).Credit score: A credit score is a rating of a consumer's creditworthiness. The score indicates how likely it is that they will make bill payments on time and repay what they borrow. Credit scores are calculated based on the consumer's financial history.Interest: A fee charged for borrowing money. The APR determines how much interest a credit card company can charge on balances. Use our interest rate calculator to get a sense of how much interest adds to your monthly bill.Minimum payment: The minimum amount a cardholder can pay by the due date to remain current on their credit card bill and avoid a late fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nWhat is the best credit card?\n\n\n\nThe best credit card for many people is the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card. It will get you a 2% cash rewards rate on purchases, making it one of the most lucrative and flexible credit cards. The $0 annual fee and lengthy 0% intro APR offer are also a big draw.While this is an easy pick to recommend for many people, it's important to know that the market is packed with plenty of the best credit cards of 2023 (included on this shortlist and not). The best credit card to have will depend on your unique situation.\n\n\n\n\nHow does a credit card work?\n\n\n\nA credit card allows you to pay for purchases by borrowing money. The maximum amount you can borrow at one time is called your credit limit. The money you've already borrowed is your balance, and the amount you have left to borrow is your available credit.At the end of each billing cycle, the card issuer will send you a statement listing the transactions you made. It will list your total balance, as well as the minimum payment due during that billing cycle. You must pay at least the minimum amount by the due date to avoid a late fee -- although it's a good idea to pay more than the minimum if you can afford it.Credit cards are most often used for purchases, but many of them can also be used for other types of transactions, such as cash advances and balance transfers.\n\n\n\n\nHow many credit cards should I have?\n\n\n\nThe right number of credit cards for most people is one. That's particularly important for cardholders using credit cards for rewards, since the juice may not always be worth the squeeze when carrying multiple cards and using each to optimize rewards for each spending category.\n\n\n\n\nHow should I use a credit card?\n\n\n\nWhether your credit card helps or hurts you all depends on how you use it. To ensure that your credit card provides value and doesn't get you in debt, here are a few key guidelines:Use your credit card regularlyOnly charge what you can affordPay on time and in fullTake advantage of your card's perks\n\n\n\n\nHow does credit card interest work?\n\n\n\nCredit card interest is the fee a card issuer can charge when you borrow money with your credit card. The amount of interest charged depends on the card's annual percentage rate (APR). Many credit cards have different APRs for purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances. Most credit cards have a variable APR. A variable APR is an interest rate that can change over time.The type of transaction also determines when your card issuer starts charging you interest. For example, cash advances almost always start racking up interest immediately. Purchases are different. Just about any top-rated credit card will only charge interest for purchases that aren't paid off by the payment due date. Savvy consumers take advantage of this, pay in full, and never have to deal with credit card interest.\n\n\n\n\nHow to apply for a credit card online\n\n\n\nChoose a credit card and click \"Apply Now\": You'll find this link on the credit card page.Fill out the required information: Card applications ask for your personal information, including your name, mailing address, date of birth, and Social Security number. They also ask for financial information, including your income. Some companies might ask about your net worth.Submit the application: You may receive an instant decision of either a credit card pre-approval or a denial (hopefully approval). The card issuer could also put your application under review, meaning it needs more time to decide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet our academic credit card experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD'Arcy Becker\n\nDepartment Chairperson and Professor of Accounting at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Maurer, Ph.D.\n\nDirector, Institute for Money, Technology, and Financial Inclusion at the University of California, Irvine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Hippler, Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Professor of Finance at the University of La Verne","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Matt Koppenheffer\n and\u00a0Lyle Daly\nOur Credit Cards Experts","Article Date":"September 28, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"11":{"Article Title":"Best Cash Back Credit Cards for October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/credit-cards\/best-cash-back-credit-card\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Still, it's a common fee that you won't have to pay with this card.Cash back in a nutshell:2% cash backHow to redeem your cash back:Statement creditDeposit made to your bank accountWhy we picked Bread Cashback\u2122 American Express\u00ae:It earns an unlimited 2% back on purchases and doesn't charge a foreign transaction fee.

Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express has one of the highest cash rewards rates we've seen when spending at U.S. supermarkets. (Terms apply.) But if you have your own business, the Ink Business Cash\u00ae Credit Card is ideal when shopping at office supply stores. Want more freedom to pick your cash back category of choice? The U.S. Bank Cash+\u00ae Visa Signature\u00ae Card can give you the flexibility you're looking for. As you can see, even though it would be great to get high cash rewards every time you spend, that isn't always the case.Will you be shopping at grocery stores, dining at your local restaurant, or traveling around the country? The rewards you earn are variable and depend on where you shop or what you purchase.\n\n\n\n\nHow to compare the best cash back credit cardsAs you shop for reward credit cards, there will probably be multiple cards that you like. Before you pick the best credit card with cash back, compare these three important features.Cash back rate: This is the most important feature. Higher cash back rates save you more money, especially if you have a high flat rate on purchases or choose bonus categories that match your spending habits.Annual fee: Cash back cards with annual fees tend to have higher cash back rates. These higher rates can make up for the annual fee if you spend enough, but you'll need to do the math on the rewards you'll earn to make sure.Bonus rewards: Many include an introductory bonus reward, making it an easy way to collect cash back. You could also look for credit cards that give cash back with 0% intro APR offers, free credit score monitoring, or many other perks.If you're looking for a feature-by-feature comparison our credit card comparison tool can help.\n\n\n\nCompare cash back credit cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Picks\n\n\n\nCard\nRating\nGreat For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Cash Back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.00 stars\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

If you have good or excellent credit and can qualify for the best cash back cards, then they're definitely worth checking out. But this type of credit card has its perks and its drawbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsCash back on purchasesEasy to useMost cash back cards don't charge an annual fee\n\n\n\n\nConsUsually have smaller sign-up bonusesFewer travel perks and other extrasCan't get any extra value on rewards redemptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe great thing about cash back cards is how simple and affordable they are. Anyone can benefit from cash back, and there's no learning curve involved like there can be with travel credit cards. You can find plenty of the best cash back credit cards with no annual fee. Even the ones with annual fees usually cost less than $100 per year.There is a tradeoff to those benefits. Cash back cards are affordable, but they also generally have smaller bonuses and fewer features than you could get from a higher-priced travel rewards card. And while cash back means rewards redemptions are a breeze, there's no way to get more value out of cash back. With rewards credit cards that earn points, it's sometimes possible to extract more value from those points if you know how to use them.\n\n\n\n\nHow to maximize your cash back rewardsUsing the best money back credit cards is a great way to save more every month. Here are the best tips to help you maximize cash back rewards:Always pay with your cash back credit card. Since you're earning cash back on purchases, take full advantage. Put as much of your spending as you can on your cash back card. There's no reason to pay with cash or a debit card and leave cash back on the table.Don't carry a balance. The key to saving money with a cash back card is to pay your credit card bill in full by the due date. If not, the card issuer can charge you credit card interest. That will likely cost you as much or more as the cash back you earned.Get multiple cash back cards to earn more bonus rewards. Instead of using a single cash back card, open a few different cards that earn bonus cash back in separate categories. That way, you could have your gas and groceries card, your restaurant card, your Amazon card, and a card with a high flat rate for all those other expenses.Complete the welcome bonus requirements. Welcome bonuses are some of the biggest cash back offers you can find, so it's important not to miss out. Whenever you get a new card with a welcome bonus, check how much you need to spend and how long you have.Check your credit card's online shopping portal for special offers. Many credit card companies have online shopping portals where you can earn up to 10% back with some retailers. Make sure to check if your card issuer offers one and, if so, what type of bonuses are available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash back vs. points\n\nCash back and points are two types of credit card rewards. Cash back is only for cash. Meanwhile, points tend to offer more redemption options than cash back does, including points for travel, a gift card, cash, or merchandise. The exact options depend on the rewards credit card you have. The advantage of points is that there are more ways to use them, but this also makes them more complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre cash back credit cards taxable?In most cases, cash back credit cards aren't taxable. If you earn the cash back by using your card for purchases, then it's not taxable, because the IRS considers it a rebate on those purchases and not income.That means any type of cash back credit card that requires spending money is treated as a rebate and isn't taxable. For example, if your card earns 4% on dining or an unlimited 2% cash back on purchases, you wouldn't need to pay taxes on that. This also includes welcome bonuses you need to spend money to earn, such as a bonus of $200 if you spend $500 in the first three months.While cash back usually isn't taxable, it could be treated as income if it doesn't require any spending on your part. Common examples include welcome bonuses that don't have a spending requirement and referral bonuses.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent types of cash back credit cardsThere are three basic types of cash back credit cards: Flat-rate cash back cards, bonus category cash back cards, and rotating bonus category cash back cards. By understanding how each type works, you'll be able to figure out how to maximize some of the best cash rewards credit cards.Flat-rate cash back cardsFlat-rate cash back cards earn the same rate on purchases, typically 1.5% or 2%. This type of cash rewards credit card is ideal if your spending is fairly balanced and you don't have any particular big spending categories among your everyday purchases.Consumers who do the math often find that they'll earn the most with a flat-rate cash back card. If you're interested in getting one, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card is hard to beat. It can get you 2% cash rewards on purchases.Bonus category cash back cardsA bonus category cash back card offers a higher cash back rate in one or more categories, such as groceries, dining, or gas.Those who spend a lot in certain categories could collect more cash back with the right bonus category card. For example, the Blue Cash Preferred\u00ae Card from American Express earns an industry-leading 6% back at U.S. supermarkets for up to $6,000 per calendar year. Terms apply. That's an extremely valuable offer, even with the card's annual fee (see rates and fees). There are bonus category cards to fit just about everyone, whether you need the best credit cards for gas, dining, or a different category.On eligible purchases outside of bonus categories, these cards have traditionally earned 1% back. But not all bonus category cards are like this anymore.Rotating bonus category cash back cardsA rotating bonus category cash back card offers a higher cash back rate in a changing mix of categories. You typically get new bonus categories every quarter with this type of card. In most cases, cardholders must activate their bonus categories before or during the quarter to earn the bonus rate.The advantages with these cash back credit cards are a very high cash back rate in bonus categories and the fact that you get new bonus categories regularly. But the latter can also be a downside, because you may occasionally get stuck with bonus categories that you won't spend much money in.Two of the most popular rotating bonus category cards are the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back and the Chase Freedom Flex\u2120. Each offers 5% back on your first $1,500 spent in rotating bonus categories you activate every quarter. The Chase Freedom Flex\u2120 is unique in that it also offers several fixed bonus categories.Highest cash back credit cardsBonus categories are a popular feature with cash back credit cards. To provide more info on them, we're going to explain how some of the most common bonus categories work and the highest cash back credit card rates you'll find in each one.Groceries: These cash back cards earn higher rates in merchants classified as grocery stores or supermarkets. This is a good time to clarify that bonus categories are based on the retailer, not the exact product you're buying. If you go to the grocery store and buy shampoo, paper towels, or any non-food items, it still counts as a grocery store purchase.The best credit card for groceries offer cash back rates of up to 6% on supermarket purchases. Since this is one of the biggest spending categories for many consumers, a grocery cash back card can be a great choice.Gas: These cash back cards earn higher rates at gas stations. They usually only offer bonus cash back at traditional gas stations, not gas stations tied to supermarkets or warehouse clubs.Gas credit cards offer up to 4% on gas station purchases. Although they can be a good fit if you have a lengthy commute or a driving job, the typical consumer spends more in other areas, like groceries.Dining: These credit cards earn higher rates at any type of restaurant, including fast food, sit-down dining establishments, and everything in between. That also covers deliveries and carryout orders with restaurants. Food delivery apps, such as DoorDash and Grubhub, may or may not qualify, so you'll need to check each card's terms to see.Dining credit cards offer up to 4% on restaurant purchases. They work well if you're the type who prefers going out to eat and placing delivery orders over cooking at home.Travel: These credit cards offer bonus cash back on either certain types of travel purchases or travel as a whole. If it's certain types of purchases, the card issuer will specify what qualifies, such as hotels or air travel. If it's travel as a whole, then anything the card issuer considers a travel category will qualify for bonus cash back.The best credit cards that earn bonus rewards on travel spending are travel credit cards, not cash back cards. Among those travel cards, rewards rates can be as high as 10% on certain types of travel purchases. Some of the best cash back credit cards offer bonus rates as high as 5% on certain types of travel purchases.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives to considerCash back cards are great, but they aren't right for everyone. You may find that one of the following alternatives works better for you.Travel rewards credit cards: Frequent travelers usually benefit the most from travel rewards credit cards. If you go on trips multiple times per year, the travel perks and rewards that these cards offer can be big moneysavers. They also almost always have no foreign transaction fee, a benefit many cash back cards lack. And some travel cards have no annual fees.Balance transfer credit cards: You can stop paying interest on credit card debt with balance transfer credit cards. This type of card offers a 0% intro APR on balance transfers. There's almost always a balance transfer fee, but that's well worth it to pay down your debt at zero interest.Student credit cards: If you're attending college, then a student credit card is a good way to get started on building your credit. While some of the best student credit cards offer cash back or other rewards, they're aimed at adults who don't have much credit history yet. You won't need good or excellent credit to get them like you would with many popular cash back cards.\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nCan you get cash back with a credit card?\n\n\n\nIn a way, yes. You'll earn a percentage back on purchases that you make with your credit card. You can then redeem your cash back earnings.

I know what to look for in a balance transfer card, including the fees and gotchas that might be hidden in the fine print or behind financial jargon. I also have a ton of experience crunching the numbers, so I can help readers understand the real-life impacts of a balance transfer on their finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing balance transfer offersThe three main points you should look at when comparing balance transfer cards are:The intro APR offer: This tells you how long you'll enjoy the 0% APR on your transferred balance. If you know you'll need a long time to pay off your balance, look for the longest introductory term you can find.The go-to or standard APR: Once your introductory rate expires, your remaining balance will start accruing interest at the standard APR. This factor becomes important if you think you won't be able to pay off your entire transferred balance before the intro offer ends.The balance transfer fee: Not only do you have to consider the transfer fee in terms of the fee itself -- lower fees are always better -- but the balance transfer fee will also reduce the total amount you can transfer.One thing you don't need to consider are the rewards. You won't earn rewards on transferred balances, and balance transfers won't count toward any kind of welcome or sign-up bonus requirements.Check out the table below to quickly compare some of our favorite balance transfer cards:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCard\n\n\nIntroductory BT Offer\n\n\nGo-To APR\n\n\nBT Fee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiti Simplicity\u00ae Card\n\n\n0%, 21 months\n\n\n19.24% - 29.99% (Variable)\n\n\n3% ($5 min) for first 4 months, then 5% ($5 min.)\n\n\n\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Balance Transfer\n\n\n0%, 18 months\n\n\n17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR\n\n\n3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms)*\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Bank Visa\u00ae Platinum Card\n\n\n0%, 18 billing cycles\n\n\n18.74% - 29.74% (Variable)\n\n\nEither 3% of the amount of each transfer or $5 minimum, whichever is greater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare balance transfer credit cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Picks\n\n\n\nCard\nRating\nGreat For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.00 stars\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

That's where a card like this shines. It has one of the longest intro APR terms we've seen, giving you 21 months at an introductory 0% APR. The go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR applies at the end of the intro period (see rates and fees).What's more, that same long term applies to both balance transfers and new purchases. Chances are good if you're dealing with existing high-interest debt, you may also need a break on new purchases. This card lets you save on both types of balances (as long as your limit holds out).This best balance transfer credit card is great for: Folks who have a mix of new purchase and balance transfer debt who want to save on interest for both. This card has the same competitively long intro term for both types of balances.When to consider an alternative: Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card has a balance transfer fee of 5%; min: $5. If you're transferring a large amount, consider looking for a card with a lower or promotional balance transfer fee. Even something like 2% can wind up getting very expensive if you're transferring $5,000 or more.Apply for a Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card on the Wells Fargo website.Discover it\u00ae Balance TransferOur top pick overall for balance transfer credit cards. It checks a lot of boxes for a good card more generally, too. First, you get 18 months 0% intro APR on balance transfers before the go-to rate of 17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR applies. That's not the longest term out there, but it's certainly competitive. And it's even better when paired with the lower promotional balance transfer fee.However, that's not all this card offers. You also get long-term, keeper-card potential out of this credit card thanks to the cash back rewards you can earn on purchases when you activate your rotating categories. Plus, you get Discover's customer service, which consistently wins awards for its quality.This best balance transfer credit card is great for: If you want a balance transfer card now, but a rewards card later, this could be the right fit. You get a competitive intro APR offer on balance transfers, plus you earn cash back rewards on eligible new purchases.When to consider an alternative: While the balance transfer offer on this card is great, the one for new purchases isn't as good: 0% Intro APR for 6 months (after which the go-to rate we mentioned above applies). If you're looking to save on interest on future purchases, check out some of our other picks.Apply for Discover it\u00ae Balance Transfer on Discover's website.Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card \u2013 18 month BT offerFirst and foremost, this card is a solid pick for balance transfers thanks to its long intro 0% APR offer. The promotional balance transfer fee also helps it stand out from the card crowd (as well as save you some money on your transfer).

Unlike some other picks on the list, this card has staying power thanks to its cash back rewards.

While the best balance transfer credit cards can save you hundreds in interest, they can also end up costing you.A balance transfer credit card is a good idea if:You want a lower interest rate. The biggest perk of 0% APR balance transfer credit cards is how much money they can save you. If you have credit card debt that you'll be paying off over six months or longer, then a balance transfer could lead to big savings.You want to consolidate debt. When you have debt spread out across multiple credit cards, it can be difficult to manage. The best balance transfer cards allow you to consolidate debt so you only need to make one payment per month.You're trying to boost your credit score. Credit card debt often results in a high credit utilization ratio, a factor that has a big impact on your credit score. Since opening a balance transfer card adds to your total credit, it will lower your credit utilization. That balance transfer could save you money and raise your credit score.A balance transfer credit card is not a good idea if:You don't have a plan to pay off your debt. A balance transfer only helps if you take advantage of the opportunity by paying off as much debt as possible before the intro APR period ends, and you don't overspend now that your debt isn't costing you any interest. Otherwise, you could reach the end of the intro period with the same amount of debt or more. Use our balance transfer calculator to see how much you could save with a balance transfer.You have subpar credit. To qualify for the top balance transfer credit cards, you'll typically need good credit. If your credit is bad or average, it's a good idea to focus on building your credit. That way you don't need to settle for a subpar balance transfer card.You could pay off existing credit card debt within a few months. When you're this close to paying off your debt, it's usually better to stick with your current credit card. A balance transfer fee could wipe out anything you'd save on interest. Even if it's a balance transfer credit card with no fee, the credit card application will still take time and cause a small dip in your credit score.\n\n\n\nHow to transfer a credit card balance\n\n\n\nSavvy consumers use credit card balance transfer offers to refinance or consolidate credit card debt. And when used correctly, the best balance transfer credit cards can save you hundreds of dollars in interest. To get the best credit card balance transfer offers, it helps to understand how balance transfers work.Here are the three steps on how to do balance transfers:Search for one of the best balance transfer credit cards. Try to find a card with a long enough intro period so that you'll be able to pay off your debt within that time frame.Open the card and transfer the balance. You'll need the credit card number of the card with the balance as well as the amount to transfer. Most card issuers let you transfer balances online. So you'll log in to the account for your balance transfer card and look for the balance transfer option. Alternatively, you can call the credit card company and do the balance transfer by phone.Make your payments. You're still required to make payments on the original card until the balance transfer is processed. You'll know that has happened once the original card balance changes. From this point on, you'll make payments on the balance transfer card.\n\n\n\nDoes a balance transfer affect your credit score?\n\n\n\nBalance transfers can hurt and help your credit. When you use a balance transfer card, it affects three factors used to calculate your credit score:New credit (10% of your FICO\u00ae Score): The credit card application will cause a hard credit inquiry, which negatively affects the new credit category. It's not a serious issue, though, as most consumers only see their FICO\u00ae Scores drop five points or less from a hard inquiry.Length of credit account history (15% of your FICO\u00ae Score): A new credit card causes your average length of credit account history to decrease, and this can hurt your credit.Credit utilization (30% of your FICO\u00ae Score): Your new balance transfer card's credit limit will increase your total credit, causing your credit utilization to go down. That's good for your credit score. But your credit utilization on each individual card is also important. If you end up with high credit utilization on the balance transfer card, then that could have a negative impact.Although your credit score may or may not drop after a balance transfer, it will likely go up as you pay down your credit card debt. After all, building a positive payment history is one of the best ways to rebuild credit. And balance transfer credit cards allow you to do that faster while also saving on interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a limit to how much you can transfer?\n\nYou can never transfer a balance that's larger than your credit limit. Some of the best 0 balance transfer credit cards will only let you transfer up to a percentage of your credit limit -- usually 70% to 95% -- while others will let you reach your credit limit. Keep in mind that any balance transfer fees will add to your balance as well. If you're transferring a $1,000 balance to a card with a 3% balance transfer fee, you'll need a credit limit big enough to cover a $1,030 balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a balance transfer credit card?\n\n\n\nA balance transfer credit card moves a balance from one account to another. Once you've completed a balance transfer, the original account is paid off, and you make payments on the account that received the transfer.You're essentially using the balance transfer card to pay off your debt. The best balance transfer credit cards come with a 0% introductory APR -- similar to 0% intro APR credit cards -- on a qualifying balance transfer. This means that you won't pay credit card interest on the balance transferred for the intro period, which can be anywhere from a few months to 20 or more billing cycles. After the introductory APR ends, the card issuer will start charging the card's regular variable APR on any remaining balance. Paying off your balance quickly will help you avoid getting an interest charge when the intro APR period ends.The type of debt you can transfer depends on your balance transfer card.Sometimes a card issuer only allows a credit card transfer of balances, whereas others let you transfer all kinds of debt. Consumers typically use balance transfer cards for credit card debt.The total amount of the transfer, plus any balance transfer fees, must be less than the balance transfer card's credit limit. If it isn't, you'll find your balance transfer denied. You can't do a credit card transfer between two cards from the same card issuer, either. A balance transfer from a Chase credit card to a Citi credit card is fine, but a transfer between two Chase credit cards wouldn't be allowed.\n\n\n\n\nBalance transfer feesA balance transfer fee is an extra fee charged by the receiving credit card -- the card you're transferring to -- to process the balance transfer. Typical balance transfer fees range from 3% to 5% of the total amount transferred.The transfer fee is generally added to your overall credit card balance. For example, if you transfer $1,000 to a credit card with a 3% balance transfer fee, you'll be charged an extra $30. Your new balance on the balance transfer card will be $1,030. In other words, you need to consider the transfer fee when determining how much you can transfer to a new card, since your total balance -- including the fee -- cannot exceed your credit limit.In addition to an introductory 0% APR, many of our favorite balance transfer cards also come with a promotional balance transfer fee. A fee drop from 5% to 3% can save you $20 per $1,000 transferred, so these promotional rates can be a big money saver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to the old credit card after the balance transfer?\n\nThe credit card that originally had the balance will remain open after the balance transfer. Although you can continue using it, you should strongly consider waiting until you've paid off all your credit card debt. That way, you don't run the risk of running up a costly balance and ending up in the same position as before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 alternatives to balance transfer credit cards\n\n\n\nIf you're not sure that a 0% APR balance transfer credit card is the best option for you, consider these alternatives:1. Personal loans for debt consolidationBy paying your debts with a personal loan, you'll have a fixed loan term, payment amount, and interest rate. Consolidating debt is a great way to ensure you can afford your monthly payments and get your debt paid off in full. Even though debt consolidation loans don't offer 0% intro APRs, you can find personal loans with low interest rates. You also won't need to worry about the APR going up like it does with balance transfer cards at the end of the intro period.2. Home equity loans\/home equity lines of creditSince a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) uses your home as collateral, they tend to offer some of the lowest interest rates you can find. Either is an affordable way to pay off debt, but you will need equity in your home to qualify. The fact that your home is the collateral also adds to your risk.3. Nonprofit credit counseling agenciesWhen you work with a credit counseling agency, it can give you advice on how to budget and pay back your debts. A credit counseling agency can also negotiate a debt management plan with your creditors. This option can be especially helpful if your credit isn't the best, as it's hard to find balance transfer credit cards for bad credit.4. Negotiating your credit card debtCredit card companies are often willing to negotiate your credit card debt with you if you're having trouble making your monthly payments. Some might even have low interest credit cards you can consider. Many offer hardship plans that can reduce your card's interest rate, fees, or minimum payment amount. Even if your card issuer doesn't, you may still be able to negotiate any of those items.\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nWhat credit score do you need for a balance transfer credit card?\n\n\n\nYou usually need a FICO\u00ae Score of 670 or higher to qualify for a balance transfer credit card. Most balance transfer cards, especially the ones with a 0% intro APR, are intended for consumers who have good or excellent credit.\n\n\n\n\nHow much is a balance transfer fee?\n\n\n\nA standard balance transfer fee is 3% or 5% of the transaction amount with a $5 minimum. To find out how much a specific credit card charges, check the fees section in its pricing and terms.\n\n\n\n\nDoes a balance transfer card affect your ability to get a mortgage?\n\n\n\nA balance transfer card alone most likely won't affect your ability to get a mortgage, but credit card debt could.Lenders check your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio when you apply for a mortgage. If you have a high DTI ratio due to credit card debt, that could negatively impact your mortgage application. Large amounts of credit card debt can also affect your credit score, which is another item that mortgage lenders consider.\n\n\n\n\nHow does a balance transfer credit card work?\n\n\n\nA balance transfer credit card can accept balance transfers from other cards. When you set up a balance transfer, your balance transfer card is paying off your other credit card(s). The amount you transfer will be taken off the original credit card and put onto the balance transfer card.\n\n\n\n\nHow long does a balance transfer take?\n\n\n\nA balance transfer can take anywhere from two days to six weeks. It depends on multiple factors, including the card issuers of both cards. Here are the typical balance transfer times for the most popular card issuers:American Express: Usually five to seven days, but can take up to six weeksBank of America: Up to 14 daysCapital One: Generally three to 14 daysChase: Seven to 21 daysCiti: Two to 21 daysDiscover: Most transfers are processed within four days, but new accounts have a 14-day waiting period before balance transfer requests can be processedU.S. Bank: Up to 14 daysWells Fargo: Up to 14 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk the experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancisca Beer, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor of Finance, California State University, San Bernardino\n\n\nDr. Francisca Beer, Professor of Finance at California State University, San Bernardino, is renowned for her expertise in corporate finance, capital markets, and international finance.

Meticulous and knowledgeable consumers who are serious about paying down debt. Balance transfers can be problematic for customers for several reasons. Some customers overlook that a transfer means making monthly payments even if the APR is 0%. Others do not account for the transfer fee when evaluating the benefits of a transfer. Yet others do not understand the impact of a transfer on their credit limit when they use an existing card. Some do not understand when penalty rates will be applied. Do you need good credit for a balance transfer credit card? The transfer request will most probably be rejected when a customer has filed for a bankruptcy in the past. Transfers might also be declined for customers with past due payments or a low credit score. In some cases, the credit score is used to calculate the length of the 0% introduction period. What do consumers need to know about 0% intro APR offers? Generally speaking, if the balance transferred can be paid off within the 0% APR intro period, the transfer is probably a good idea. If the balance cannot be paid within that period of time, it's important to know what the APR will be. It's probably better to avoid using the card for anything else than paying the transfer balance. So customers should steer clear of using the card for both transfer and new purchases.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Brittney Myers\nOur Credit Cards Expert","Article Date":"September 29, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"13":{"Article Title":"Best Travel Credit Cards of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/credit-cards\/best-travel-rewards-credit-cards\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

The beauty of this card is in its generous rewards combined with its simplicity.Because the rewards are a flat two miles per dollar spent, there's no need to juggle cards and remember which card to use when. Every purchase, no matter whether at a coffee shop, electronics retailer, or music streaming service \u2013 two miles per dollar.Now this doesn't mean that you can't juggle cards. I did. The two miles per dollar is a great baseline rewards rate, so I would use this as my default card, but then pull out other specific cards only for focused categories, for instance keeping my Amazon spending on my Amazon card. But in my view, you can get away with a single card if you have this one.Rewards redemption is another way this card is extremely easy. There are a wide variety of ways you can use miles, including booking travel on the Capital One travel portal, transferring to one of Capital One's partners, and using miles to cover travel purchases on your card statement. I did mostly the latter \u2013 it's not the highest opportunity redemption, but it was ridiculously easy.I will admit I didn't make the most of the perks on this card, but there are quite a few. Traveling around Europe, the no foreign transaction fees were critical. And I always make use of card protections when available \u2013 like the rental car coverages and extended warranty on this card. And though I'm more of a \"get in and out of the airport fast\" kind of person, the card does provide limited lounge access for the Capital One lounges and certain partner lounges.There's a $95 annual fee (see rates and fees), which I never balked at because I got so much value out of the card. Right now, with a welcome offer of $750 miles, it's even easier to justify that fee.Apply for the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card on Capital One's website.Pros:Unlimited flat-rate rewards of 2X miles on every purchase$750-mile bonus offerEasy miles redemptionMany useful travel perks, including lounge accessCons:$95 annual feeHigher rewards rate possible with tiered systemsBest no annual fee travel credit card: Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit cardRewards rate: Unlimited 1.5 points per dollar spent on per $1 spent on all purchasesWhy we picked it: Many of the top travel cards come with an annual fee. This card proves that you don't need to pay an annual fee to get solid travel rewards.What we think you need to know about the Bank of America Travel Rewards:I haven't used this card in particular, but I do have and use its sister card \u2013 the Bank of America\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card. The rewards program is different, but the core of these cards, as well as the Bank of America\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card, is very similar. Namely, they're all really great rewards cards with no annual fee, and all get a significant bump in rewards if you're a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member (as I am).The rewards here are simple: You get 1.5 points for every dollar spent, no matter the category. Points can be redeemed as a statement credit to pay for travel-related expenses like flights, hotels, rental cars, and restaurants. Each point credits $0.01, so every $1,000 spent on the card gets you 1,000 points, which gets you $10 in potential credits for travel spending.The 25,000 points you can earn via the card's welcome offer (after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days days after account opening) work the same way. So that welcome offer is worth $250 towards travel.You generally can't expect a huge number of extra perks on a card with no annual fee, and that's the case here. However, there is an introductory 0% interest offer, currently at 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases and 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days (after that, the go-to variable rate applies, which is currently 18.24% - 28.24% (Variable)).I don't always enjoy trying to manage my financial accounts via app, but the Bank of America app is one that I do use regularly. I could quibble a bit about the design, but I think the usability is great. It's easy to navigate between multiple types of Bank of America accounts. I can see card balances, due dates, rewards earned, and easily sign up for partner deals that often feature 10% to 15% savings.Also, Bank of America Preferred Rewards members get a 25% to 75% boost on the rewards that this card earns. That means that they're getting between 1.87 and 2.62 points per dollar spent. That, combined with no annual fee (see rates and fees), makes this card or one of its sister cards basically a no-brainer for Preferred Rewards members.Apply for the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card on Bank of America's website.Pros:No annual feeUnlimited 1.5 points per dollar spent on every purchase25,000 points bonus offer0% intro APR offer for 15 billing cycles on purchases and balance transfers (after which the go-to rate of 18.24% - 28.24% (Variable) applies)25%-75% rewards boost for Preferred Rewards membersCons:Higher rewards rates available on cards with an annual feeLimited perksBest premium travel credit card: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit CardRewards rate: Earn 10X miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel and 5X miles on flights booked through Capital One Travel. 2X miles on all other purchases.Why we picked it: High rewards rates, hefty welcome bonus offer, travel credit, anniversary miles, and travel perks that you'll actually use. For frequent travelers, the benefits of this card can easily justify the high annual fee.What we think you should know about the Capital One Venture X Card:The first question you should ask with a premium travel card is whether the big annual fee (see rates and fees) is justified. For frequent travelers, we think the answer is most likely yes for the $395 fee on the Capital One Venture X Card.It'd be hard to not get more than that value back in the first year, as the card has a welcome offer of 75,000 miles (after spending $4,000 in purchases in the first 3 months). We'd say that's conservatively worth $750 in travel, and possibly more if you redeem well.Past the first year though, we still think the value of the card holds up well. For one, you get an annual $300 in statement credits for bookings through Capital One Travel. Plus, you get a 10,000 mile anniversary bonus, worth $100. So right there, you've got $400 in value to weigh against the $395 annual fee. We could argue that everything else is gravy.In any case, the rest of the features just further bump up the value of the card on an ongoing basis. That includes the high rewards rates you get booking through Capital One Travel \u2013 10X miles for hotels and car rentals and 5X miles for flights. It also includes the solid 2X miles per dollar that you get on the rest of your purchases. And it includes premium travel perks like unlimited access to lounges for you and two guests (there aren't many Capital One lounges, but you also have access to the 1,300+ lounges available in its partner network).There is a longer list of perks for many of the competing premium travel cards. This dings the Capital One Venture X Card a bit, but a lot of those perks get more targeted and won't be a fit for everyone. Plus, many competing premium travel cards have an even higher annual fee.It's also worth pointing out that additional cardholders can be added with no fee. That's not always the case, especially with premium-level cards.And of course rewards points and miles are only as good as your ability to actually use them. In this case, there are multiple options, including the extremely easy option of using miles to cover travel expenses on your statement.Apply for the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card on Capital One's website.Pros:High rewards rate, including strong baseline rate$750-mile welcome offerAnnual $300 travel credit and bonus 10,000 anniversary milesPremium travel perks, including worldwide lounge accessNo fee for additional cardholdersCons:High annual feeHighest rewards rates annual travel credit require using Capital One Travel portalNot as many perks as other premium travel cardsRunner-up: best premium travel card with flexible redemption options: Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae CardRewards rate: 5X points on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards\u00ae, 2X points on other travel, 3X points on dining, online grocery orders, and select streaming services, 1 point per $1 on other purchasesWhy we picked it: It earns bonus rewards across a variety of categories and has a welcome offer of 60,000 bonus points. Plus, this card's Ultimate Rewards points give you lots of high-value redemption options.What we think you should know about the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card: Both Chase Sapphire cards are loaded with benefits, but there's one in particular that makes them special -- their rewards program. Chase Ultimate Rewards is The Ascent's pick for the best credit card rewards program.I have the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, and I also had the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card, back when you could have one of each. I got both because they each have fantastic welcome offers and rewards rates, so they're great for earning lots of points.With either card, you can transfer your points to many airline and hotel loyalty programs, and there are some incredible savings opportunities this way. For example, I've transferred Ultimate Rewards points to Hyatt and booked a stay at a four-star hotel in New York, paying in points for what would have been a $5,634 stay. I've also transferred points to book business-class airfare, once saving $4,142 in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first-hand review\n\nI initially got this card for the sky high welcome bonus, but have kept it due to several of its unique features and benefits \u2014 which make it well worth the $95 annual fee. One of the highlights is Trip Delay Reimbursement. If your common carrier travel is delayed more than 12 hours or requires an overnight stay, you and your family are covered for unreimbursed expenses, such as meals and lodging, up to $500 per ticket.-Ethan Mellin, team member at The Motley Fool Ascent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card on Chase's website.Pros:2x to 5x points in bonus categories that include dining, travel, and online grocery ordersWelcome offer of 60,000 bonus pointsTransferable points with over a dozen travel partnersCons:Charges a $95 annual feeNon-bonus purchases earn standard rate of 1x point per $1\n\n\n\n\nAlso good for: best premium travel card for dining out: American Express\u00ae Gold CardRewards rate: 4X points at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 per calendar year in purchases) and restaurants, plus takeout and delivery in the U.S., 3X points on flights booked directly with airlines or on amextravel.com, 1x point per $1 on other purchases, terms apply.Why we picked it: There aren't many travel cards that earn high rewards rates on groceries and dining. This American Express card does, offering outstanding rewards on your U.S. supermarket and restaurant spending. Terms apply.What we think you should know about the American Express\u00ae Gold Card: The American Express\u00ae Gold Card seems expensive at first, with a $250 annual fee. (see rates and fees). But if you can take advantage of its benefits, it's practically a steal.Case in point, it offers $10 per month in dining credits at participating restaurants and $10 per month in Uber Cash. That's up to $240 in annual credits. Use those, and this card is only costing you $10. Select enrollment required, terms apply.American Express cards are usually a good fit for big spenders, and this one's no exception. If you have high spending in its bonus categories, you'll earn points quickly. And its bonus categories cover some of the biggest monthly expenses for many households.Many of this card's benefits are designed with U.S. consumers in mind, including the spending credits and bonus rewards at U.S. supermarkets. That's something to keep in mind if you travel often or live abroad.Apply for the American Express\u00ae Gold Card on American Express's website.Pros:4X points at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 per calendar year in purchases) and restaurants, plus takeout and delivery in the U.S.Transferable points with many airline and hotel partnersUp to $120 in annual dining creditsUp to $120 in annual Uber CashCons:Expensive with a $250 annual feeU.S.-centric benefits that may not be as useful for frequent travelersBest Airline Card: Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Gold American Express CardRewards rate: 2X miles on U.S. supermarkets and at restaurants worldwide, including takeout and delivery in the U.S..Why we picked it: 40,000-mile welcome offer, free checked bags, and a variety of useful travel perks make this a top airline-specific credit card. (terms apply).My first-hand review:Choosing an airline credit card is fairly simple: choose the card of the airline you fly a lot. The rewards rates on airline cards are generally not that great, the ones that are even halfway worthwhile have annual fees, and the rewards are focused on that airline's frequent flyer program.So if you don't regularly fly the airline of the card, it's going to be very hard to justify having that card. Past that, there are some airline cards that are just not that good, whether or not you fly that airline.Which brings us to the Amex Delta SkyMiles Gold. This card meets the sweet spot of being an airline that has broad enough route coverage that it's a good option out of many airports, plus the credit card itself is good. Which is why I used to have this card in my own wallet.The welcome bonus offer is a big part of the value here. Currently 40,000, this could be worth significant travel value on Delta flights.For ongoing value though, the free checked bags, the $100 flight credit (after spending $10,000 in a calendar year), and the potential Delta-specific savings are what could easily justify the card staying in your wallet. (Terms apply; enrollment may be required.)Starting with the checked bag fee waiver, this alone can make the card very valuable for a family. We are a family of four, with young kids. It's basically impossible to travel carry-on only like when my wife and I were child-free and globetrotting. The first checked bag on a Delta flight is $30 each way. If you take one flight per year and check two bags round trip, the $120 that you save already more than pays for the annual fee of this card in years 2+.Then we can add on the $100 flight credit. You have to spend $10,000 to earn this, but this isn't points that you have to redeem -- it's a much simpler Delta Flight Credit. And then the card also gives you access to TakeOff 15, which takes 15% off the price when you book Award Travel with Delta points on delta.com or the Delta app.But what about earning rewards? Well, that's not as great. 2X miles per dollar on select categories \u2013 in this case Delta purchases, restaurants, and U.S. supermarkets \u2013 is not all that great, especially for a card that (after the first year) carries an annual fee. (Terms apply; see rates and fees.)That said, it's nice that this card offers higher earning rates on spend other than with the airline, as many airline cards only give elevated rewards rates for spend with that airline.I mentioned above that I \"used\" to have this in my wallet. Why don't I have it anymore? We got sick of driving to Atlanta (a Delta hub) for flights, so we don't fly Delta much anymore. Which brings me back to my original point: If you're going to get an airline card, the best one is the one of the airline you fly most (or at least fly a lot).And if you happen to fly Delta a lot? You're in luck, because this is a very good card for Delta fliers.Apply for the Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Gold American Express Card on American Express's website.Pros:First checked bag fee waived for main cardholder and up to eight others (nine waivers total)40,000-mile bonus offer (after spending $2,000 in the first 6 months)15% savings on Delta Award Travel when booked through delta.com or Delta appHigher rewards rate on restaurants and U.S. supermarkets, in addition to Delta spendCons:Uninspiring 2X miles is the higher rewards rate$0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $99.Best hotel credit card: Hilton Honors American Express CardRewards rate: 7X points on Hilton purchases, 5X on eligible purchases at U.S. restaurants, at U.S. supermarkets, and at U.S. gas stations, 3X for all other purchases.Why we picked it: This is a no annual fee card with decent rewards earning rates and a welcome offer of 80,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points. If you stay at Hilton properties, this card can be a great fit. (Terms apply; see rates and fees.)What we think you need to know about the Amex Hilton Honors Card:As with airline cards, choosing a hotel credit card really comes down to two factors: 1) Which hotels do you usually choose? and 2) Does that hotel group offer a decent card?If you don't stay at a certain hotel group's properties, that hotel-brand card isn't going to make much sense for you. And even if you do stay at the brand's properties, some hotel credit cards just aren't that good.If you do happen to stay at Hilton properties though, this is a quality card that brings some nice perks.Before we talk about rewards, it's important to note that Hilton Honors points don't value out as highly as other points systems (this is true of most hotel points programs). It's basically fair to think of points as worth about half of other non-hotel points, depending on what exactly you're comparing it to.That means that the points-earning on this card isn't as wildly high as it may seem at first glance. However, even after cutting the rates in half \u2013 3.5x on Hilton spend, 2.5x on dining, 2.5x on U.S. supermarkets and gas stations, etc. \u2013 it's still very reasonable for a card that has no annual fee.Right now there's also a welcome offer of 80,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points when you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months.The card also gives holders Hilton Honors Silver Status, which unlocks Hilton property bonuses like a 20% boost on points-earning on stays, free bottled water, and a fifth night free on reward stays.There aren't all that many beyond this, but for those that stay more often at Hilton properties and are willing to pay an annual fee, the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass\u00ae Card and the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card offer higher earn rates, bigger welcome bonuses, a higher status boost, and more perks.Apply for the Hilton Honors American Express Card on American Express's website.Pros:No annual feeWelcome offer of 80,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points (after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months)Hilton Honors Silver Status boost7X points on purchases at hotels and resorts in the Hilton portfolioCons:Limited perksLower comparative rewards value after adjusting against other (mainly non-hotel) points systems\n\n\n\n\nMore of our top travel credit card picksThough these cards didn\u2019t make our top picks list above, they are still high-quality travel cards in our view.

Make sure the card you choose works for your budget or stick to the best travel credit card with no annual fee if you'd prefer.Sign-up bonus: Many travel cards offer some of the biggest sign-up bonuses on the market. Compare both the bonuses that your chosen cards offer and the amount you'd need to spend on eligible purchases to receive each bonus.Rewards rate: The best credit cards for travel rewards often have bonus categories where they earn more rewards, such as 3 points per $1 on dining. Others earn the same rate on purchases, such as 2 points per $1 on all eligible purchases no matter the category. See which travel credit cards have rewards rates fit for your spending habits.Additional benefits: There are all kinds of features available with credit card travel rewards, from complimentary elite status with airlines and hotels to travel insurance policies. Review each card's extras to figure out how much value it would offer you.Choose some of the top travel credit cards that stand out to you. If you're looking for the best travel credit cards for beginners, the simplest way to evaluate them is to use The Ascent's tool to compare credit card offers for a feature-by-feature review.\n\n\n\nIs a credit card with travel rewards right for me?\n\n\n\nThe more that you travel, the better a travel points credit card will work for you. If you go on two or three trips per year, you should be able to make the most of the benefits that the best travel card offers. If you're traveling even more frequently than that, then the best travel rewards card will likely be extremely valuable to you. If you don't travel that much, other rewards credit cards would be a better option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints vs. miles: what's the difference?\n\nPoints and miles are two ways of referring to travel rewards. The term that's used depends on the credit card issuer, and neither has a set definition. In general, credit card points is the more common term. Credit card miles is a term used primarily by airlines. However, neither is set in stone. There are other types of travel cards that refer to their rewards as miles, and there are credit cards with airline miles that refer to their rewards as points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much are travel rewards worth?\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of different loyalty programs, and they all have their own travel rewards. The tricky part is figuring out how these travel rewards compare to each other. For example, are miles with Delta and Southwest worth the same amount, or is one more valuable?Although airline and hotel rewards don't have a fixed value, we've calculated approximate values based on what they're usually worth. You may get more or less depending on how you redeem them, but these are the usual values with the major airline and hotel loyalty programs.Airline rewards values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirline\n\n\nValue per mile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\n\n$0.016\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\n\n$0.014\n\n\n\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\n\n$0.014\n\n\n\n\nFrontier Airlines\n\n\n$0.010\n\n\n\n\nJetBlue Airways\n\n\n$0.014\n\n\n\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\n\n$0.014\n\n\n\n\nSpirit Airlines\n\n\n$0.011\n\n\n\n\nUnited Airlines\n\n\n$0.013\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on The Ascent's valuation\n\n\n\nHotel rewards values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHotel\n\n\nValue per point\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Western\n\n\n$0.007\n\n\n\n\nChoice Hotels\n\n\n$0.006\n\n\n\n\nHilton\n\n\n$0.005\n\n\n\n\nHyatt\n\n\n$0.016\n\n\n\n\nIHG\n\n\n$0.006\n\n\n\n\nMarriott\n\n\n$0.007\n\n\n\n\nRadisson\n\n\n$0.004\n\n\n\n\nWyndham\n\n\n$0.009\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on The Ascent's valuation\n\n\n\nLove Rewards?

Below are the types of benefits available with travel cards. Once you know which benefits you want, you can look for cards that have those features.Purchase rewards: The best travel credit cards earn rewards on purchases, and you can redeem them for free travel. Many of the most popular travel cards also have bonus categories in which you earn more rewards than the standard rate. If you find a card with bonus categories that match your spending habits, you can maximize your rewards.Sign-up bonus: Most travel cards include a sign-up bonus offer, which is a big chunk of rewards you can earn as a new cardholder. To get the bonus, you need to complete the terms. This usually requires spending a certain amount on the card within a timeframe, such as $3,000 in the first three months.Airport lounge access: Airline credit cards and premium travel credit cards often include complimentary access to airport lounge programs. If you spend a lot of time at the airport, this perk can make waiting for your flight more comfortable.Free checked luggage: Many airline credit cards allow you to check one or more bags for free. Depending on the card, companions traveling on the same itinerary may get to share in this benefit.Free night certificate: A common feature of hotel credit cards is a yearly free night certificate. Terms apply on when and where you can use these certificates, and they usually don't work at the most expensive properties. However, they can still save you $100 or more.Travel protections: Many of the best travel credit cards often include complimentary protections on eligible purchases such as:Car rental loss and damage insuranceTrip cancellation and interruption insuranceTrip delay insuranceLost luggage reimbursementSpending credits: Premium travel credit cards with high annual fees typically have spending credits to balance out their fees. These credits automatically apply on eligible purchases. Here are a few examples:A membership fee credit for TSA PreCheck, Global Entry, or CLEARAn annual credit covering travel purchasesA monthly credit for Uber, DoorDash, or other popular appsElite loyalty program status: Gaining elite status in airline and hotel loyalty programs normally requires that you make quite a few bookings. Some of the top travel credit cards let you cut the line by offering cardholders complimentary elite status with one or more loyalty programs.\n\n\n\nTypes of travel rewards credit cards\n\n\n\nThere are four types of travel rewards credit cards. You'll find a description of each type below.Airline credit cardsAn airline credit card is tied to an airline loyalty program, also known as a frequent flyer program. When you use the best credit card for frequent flyers, it earns miles in that program. You can redeem your miles for award airfare. Instead of paying $250 for a ticket, you may be able to buy it for 25,000 miles. The best credit card for airline miles often include additional perks with the airline, such as free checked luggage or airport lounge access.Hotel credit cardsA hotel credit card is tied to a hotel loyalty program. When you use a hotel credit card, it earns rewards points in that program. You can redeem your points for award hotel stays, such as paying 30,000 points per night instead of $150 per night. Hotel credit cards also frequently offer extra perks with the hotel chain. These could include a complimentary late checkout, elite status in the hotel's loyalty program, or a free night award every year.Travel credit cards with fixed-rate rewardsA travel credit card with fixed-rate rewards lets you redeem your rewards for cash travel purchases. Rewards are always worth the same amount toward travel this way. For example, if your card offers $0.01 per point, then 10,000 points will always be worth $100 in travel. Depending on the card, you can either use your rewards as a statement credit toward previous travel purchases, use them in the card issuer's travel portal to book travel, or both.Travel credit cards with transferable rewardsA travel credit card with transferable rewards lets you send your rewards to other loyalty programs. For example, if your travel card has rewards you can transfer to Hyatt Hotels, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines, then you could send your points to any of those programs. You would then be able to book travel through that loyalty program using your points.They're great if you don't have any specific airlines or hotels you like more than the rest. Specifically, look for travel cards in a major credit card rewards program:Chase Ultimate RewardsAmerican Express Membership RewardsCapital One Venture RewardsCiti ThankYou RewardsSince these card issuers have large rosters of airline and hotel partners, they offer the best international travel credit cards.\n\n\n\nAlternatives to travel credit cards\n\n\n\nNot sure if a credit card with travel points is what you need? Here are the most popular alternatives.Cash back credit cardsA cash back credit card earns rewards on purchases. The difference is that instead of rewards you can use for travel, it earns cash rewards. You can typically redeem your cash back as a statement credit on your credit card bill, a deposit to your bank account, or a check. Cash back cards are great for consumers who want to earn credit card rewards but aren't big travelers. The reward can also be much easier to use, and many cash back credit cards don't have annual fees.Credit cards for bad creditA credit card for bad credit is one that you can get even if you have a low credit score or no credit history. In that situation, it's unlikely you'll qualify for a travel card. The better route is to get one of these credit cards for bad credit, use it to build your credit, and apply for a travel card once you have a higher credit score.\n\n\n\nTravel credit card terminology\n\n\n\nAirport lounge access: A credit card feature that allows the cardholder to visit certain airport lounges free of charge or at a discounted rate.Annual fee: A fee charged once per year for a credit card. Annual fees for travel credit cards range from $0 to over $500.Bonus category: A spending category in which a credit card earns bonus rewards. For example, a travel credit card may earn 5 points per $1 on air travel, compared to 1 point per $1 on regular purchases.Credit card rewards program: A loyalty program offered by a credit card company. The most popular credit card rewards programs are:Chase Ultimate RewardsAmerican Express Membership RewardsCapital One Venture RewardsCiti ThankYou RewardsElite status: Any status above the basic, introductory tier in a travel provider's loyalty program. Airlines and hotels usually have multiple tiers in their loyalty programs, and elite status tiers offer more benefits. Each tier has its own entry requirements, such as spending a minimum amount or making a minimum number of bookings. Some travel cards include elite status in a loyalty program as a complimentary perk.Foreign transaction fee: A credit card fee charged on transactions made in foreign currencies or transactions that go through international banks. Most travel credit cards don't charge foreign transaction fees.Loyalty program: A program offered by a business to encourage customer loyalty. Loyalty programs offer special rewards for members. These programs are common with travel providers such as airlines and hotels, and allow travelers to earn rewards to use for free bookings. They're also referred to as rewards programs, and airline loyalty programs are also referred to as frequent flyer programs.Redemption options: The ways that travel rewards can be used. These options depend on the type of travel rewards and the loyalty program.Rewards rate: The amount of rewards a credit card earns per $1 spent. Some credit cards offer the same amount on every purchase, such as 2 points per $1 on all eligible purchases. Other cards offer more in bonus categories.Sign-up bonus: A credit card bonus offer available to new cardholders. Most sign-up bonuses include a requirement to earn the bonus amount, such as spending a certain amount within a set time period. Another common term for a sign-up bonus is a welcome bonus or welcome offer.Spending credit: A statement credit towards one or more purchases on your credit card bill. Some travel credit cards offer spending credits, and they generally apply to specific types of purchases over a certain time. For example, a travel card could offer a $300 annual credit towards travel purchases.Transferable rewards\/points\/miles: Rewards that can be transferred to the loyalty programs of multiple travel providers. Transferable rewards are widely considered the most valuable, because they can be used for travel bookings with different airlines and\/or hotels.Travel portal: An online platform for booking travel. Many major credit card issuers have travel portals cardholders can use to book trips.Travel rewards: A loyalty program currency that can be redeemed for travel. Travel rewards are usually referred to as points or miles, depending on the loyalty program.\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nHow to choose the best travel rewards credit cards\n\n\n\nThe first thing you should do is figure out which card's rewards program will work best for your travel habits. When in doubt, get a travel card with transferable rewards. These give you the most ways to book travel, so they're great if you don't have any specific airlines or hotels you like more than the rest.Pick a card that will earn you lots of travel rewards. If possible, it's great to get a card with a high rewards rate and a large sign-up bonus. Even if you can't get that, any card you're considering should offer at least one of the two. The more reward points you earn, the more money you'll save on travel.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I maximize my travel rewards credit card?\n\n\n\nTake advantage of as many benefits as possible. Go through your travel card's features to make sure you don't forget to use any of them. If it has airport lounge access, see which lounges you can get into and if there's a registration process required first. If your card has travel protections, such as trip delay or lost luggage reimbursement, learn how they work in case you ever need to use them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk the Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew O.

It depends on how often you travel with that particular company. If you travel a lot, the card might make sense. What should one consider when selecting a travel credit card? Two major points are the interest rate and the benefits, i.e. priority check-in, upgrades, club membership, fee waiver, etc. Other considerations are: Can you earn points on non-travel spending?

That's also the case with this Citi card, but it's unique in that it earns 5% back in your top eligible spend category (from a list of 10) every billing cycle, up to a spending cap of $500.For that reason, this card is a good fit for consumers with high spending in a single category, and who are looking to stretch some purchases out over the intro APR period. If that's the case, you can take full advantage of both this card's top benefits: The long 0% intro APR and the excellent cash back rate.To give you a few examples, it would be a fantastic choice for financing home improvement projects. That's because home improvement stores are one of the eligible 5% back categories. It would also work well for paying off concert and other event tickets over time, as live entertainment is another of the 5% back categories. The bottom line is that if any of its categories matches where you plan to spend money, this 0% APR card from Citi could be a winner.Leveraging the full card benefits:0% intro APR for 15 months on:New purchasesBalance transfersGo-to variable APR applies after the intro period endsWelcome offer: Competitive rewards sign-up bonus.Citi Entertainment: Get access to music, sports, culinary experiences, and more.Free credit score tool: View your FICO\u00ae Score, updated monthly, and review the factors impacting it.Bonus cash back where you spend the most: 5% back in your top eligible spend category up to $500 spent each billing cycle.View more pros & cons of the Citi Custom Cash\u00ae CardCiti Simplicity\u00ae Card Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.75\/5.00 stars.

Another special thing about this card is that it doesn't charge late fees, an annual fee, or a penalty APR.It's always best to avoid late fees and penalty APRs in the first place, by paying your credit card bill on time. But at least with this card, you know you won't have to deal with them, no matter what.

It allows you to divide eligible purchases into equal monthly payments with no interest for your chosen repayment period. There is a small, fixed monthly fee, but we love that the card lets you set up your own repayment plan.With such a long 0% intro APR, it's no surprise that this card doesn't earn rewards.

The Wells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card is built for this job, offering a long intro period that eclipses our other top picks.The main thing to consider here is how long you need to pay off your purchase. If you need as long as you can get, then you may have to sacrifice rewards for a longer introductory period. However, if you can pay off your purchase in 15 months or less, there are a lot of rewards cards worth considering.Sometimes, you know going into it that you'll need as long as possible to pay off a particularly large purchase (such as a car repair or medical bill). These cards are all built for long-term financing, offering at least 18 months of 0% APR on new purchases.Compare the best no interest credit cards on purchases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCard\n\n\n0% Intro APR Offer\n\n\nRegular APR\n\n\nRewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card\n\n\n0% intro APR, 21 months from account opening\n\n\n18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR\n\n\nN\/A\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Bank Visa\u00ae Platinum Card\n\n\n0%, 18 billing cycles on purchases\n\n\n18.74% - 29.74% (Variable)\n\n\nN\/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, while these cards all have fantastic intro APR offers -- that's about all you get. These cards don't come with purchase rewards or other perks that will make you want to keep them for the long haul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest 0% APR cards for balance transfersOur top pick here is the Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card (see rates and fees) thanks to its long zero interest 21 months introductory period and a low introductory balance transfer fee. If you want to compare your other options, those are the two main features to consider.\n\n\n\nBalance transfers are used to move debt from one credit card to another card. When you transfer a balance to a card with a 0% intro APR offer for balance transfers, that balance won't accrue interest until the end of the intro period. Once that ends, the balance will start accruing interest at the go-to APR.Learn more: Balance transfer guideMany folks will have been dealing with their debt for a while before they transfer it, so it's likely you'll be looking to get as much time as possible to pay it off. The cards below have the longest no-interest introductory periods of our top picks.Although these offers mean you won't accrue interest for up to 21 months, you don't have the whole intro period to transfer your balance. Instead, each card has its own time limit on when you need to transfer your balance for it to be eligible for the 0% intro rate. Any balance transferred after this time limit won't qualify for the zero interest offer.Balance transfer fees for 0% intro APR cardsBalance transfers can be excellent ways to reduce your interest fees, but they're generally not free. Nearly all credit cards charge a balance transfer fee. That said, some of our top picks have lower fees than their competitors. Others offer lower fees as part of the welcome offer for new cardholders.The balance transfer fee is charged by the card you move the balance to, not the one you move the balance from, so you only need to pay it once per transfer.Keep in mind that the balance transfer fee counts against your balance transfer limit. In other words, it reduces the total amount you can transfer to that card, so be sure to include it in your calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the best 0% APR balance transfer credit cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCard\n\n\nBalance Transfer Intro APR Offer\n\n\nRegular APR\n\n\nBalance Transfer Fee\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo Reflect\u00ae Card\n\n\n0% intro APR, 21 months from account opening on qualifying balance transfers\n\n\n18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR\n\n\n5%; min: $5\n\n\n\n\nCiti Simplicity\u00ae Card\n\n\nIntro APR of 0%, 21 months\n\n\n19.24% - 29.99% (Variable)\n\n\n3% ($5 min) for first 4 months, then 5% ($5 min.)\n\n\n\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Balance Transfer\n\n\nIntro APR of 0%, 18 months\n\n\n17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR\n\n\n3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms)*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest 0% APR credit cards with rewardsA good pick for most folks will be the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card, which pairs a high flat rewards rate with a competitive introductory term. Many rewards credit cards also offer intro APR deals, so you can earn rewards and still save money on interest fees. Remember that you only earn rewards on new purchases. You won't earn cash back rewards on any transferred balances.Compare our other top cards with both rewards and intro APR offers below.\n\n\n\nSome zero-interest cards are one-trick ponies that are only really good for saving on interest fees. However, many cards offer not only solid 0% intro APR offers, but also come with great purchase rewards, too. Even better, you can earn rewards on your new purchases while still enjoying the 0% interest rate during your introductory period.See more: Best rewards credit cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the best 0% APR cards with rewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCard\n\n\nIntro APR Purchase Offer\n\n\nRegular APR\n\n\nRewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card\n\n\n0% intro APR, 15 months from account opening\n\n\n20.24%, 25.24%, or 29.99% variable APR\n\n\n2% cash rewards\n\n\n\n\nChase Freedom Flex\u2120\n\n\n0% Intro APR on Purchases, 15 months\n\n\n20.49%-29.24% Variable\n\n\n1% - 5% cash back\n\n\n\n\nCiti Custom Cash\u00ae Card\n\n\nIntro APR of 0%, 15 months\n\n\n19.24% - 29.24% (Variable)\n\n\n1% - 5% cash back\n\n\n\n\nDiscover it\u00ae Balance Transfer\n\n\nIntro APR of 0%, 6 months\n\n\n17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR\n\n\n1% - 5% Cashback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre 0% APR credit cards worth it?Ideally, we'd all pay our credit card balances in full each month. But sometimes you just need a little more time. You can get that time -- without the high interest fees with a top 0% APR credit card. But make note, once the intro period ends, you'll start accruing interest at the go-to rate.Credit cards with a 0% intro APR are useful if you want to avoid interest charges, either on purchases or balance transfers. Make sure to consider how long of a 0% APR period you need. Cards with the longest 0% introductory periods often offer just that -- long 0% APR periods -- but nothing else.If your specific needs are met with a somewhat shorter introductory APR period, you may be able to find a card that meets that need and provides rewards or cash back, for instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntip_light_bulb\nexported from figma\n\n\n\nTIP\n\n\n\nWhen to get a 0% APR credit card\n\nIf you have any costly purchases coming up that you can't pay for in full, a credit card with 0% intro APR could be the solution. You can stretch your payments out over the card's introductory period, and you'll avoid paying interest as long as you pay off your balance before it ends. But you do need to understand how zero interest credit cards work first, to avoid making any costly mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do credit cards with 0% APR work?On intro 0% APR credit cards, the intro APR on purchases is set to 0% for a limited period of time. That means you don't need to pay off your full credit card balance every month to avoid interest during the intro period, as you would with other credit cards.As an example, imagine you get the best 0% APR credit card with an intro 0% APR on purchases for 15 months. You use it to buy a new computer for $1,500. All you need to do is make the minimum payment every month. If you make payments of at least $100 per month toward that purchase, then you'll pay it off interest free.There are situations where you can be charged interest by your credit card company, even with a 0% credit card APR:You don't make your minimum monthly payment. You're still required to make minimum payments on time. If you don't, the card issuer could cancel the intro 0% APR offer.You use your credit card for other types of transactions. Most cards' 0% intro APR offers don't apply to cash advances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nOpt for 0% APR credit cards with a lengthy intro period\n\nLessen your monthly payments with a lengthy intro period, like a 21 month no interest credit card. Make sure it doesn't charge an annual fee as that will eat into what you're saving on interest. Make it even better with the best credit card offers that have cash rewards or a welcome bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives to no interest credit cardsDepending on your financial needs, interest free credit cards with 0% intro APR may not be the right choice. Here are the top alternatives to credit cards with a 0% intro APR.Balance transfer credit cardsIf you have credit card debt to refinance, then a zero interest credit card balance transfer is the way to go. A balance transfer is when you move existing credit card balances onto a new card. The top 0 balance transfer credit cards have 0% intro APR periods on any balances you transfer over. In most cases, you'll have to pay a balance transfer fee. Head to our balance transfer calculator to find out whether the interest you'd save with a balance transfer credit card is worth its balance transfer fee.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent's best balance transfer credit cardsCredit cards with low interestIf you expect it to take you more than a couple years to pay off your balance, and if you have excellent credit, you might be better off with a low interest credit card. These credit cards have a low ongoing APR on all purchases, so they're good to keep on hand in case you ever need to carry a balance. Sometimes these cards will also let you earn cash rewards. Some credit unions even offer low interest credit cards with rates lower than many personal loans.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent's best low interest credit cardsPersonal loansWith a personal loan, you'll have a fixed payment amount and loan term, which gives you more structure than a credit card. Personal loans are also better for when you will take two years or longer to pay off a purchase because they have lower interest rates than credit cards. But if you are confident you can pay off a purchase within the intro period of an intro 0% credit card, then the card would save you money. The better your credit score, the better your chances are of securing a personal loan with a low interest rate.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent's best personal loansDebt consolidation loansYou can get a debt consolidation loan for any type of debt. It can be more versatile than a balance transfer card, because some balance transfer cards (but not all) can only be used for credit card debt. Debt consolidation loans are also a good choice when you need more time to pay off your debt than the intro period a balance transfer card gives you.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent's best debt consolidation loans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do credit card interest rates work?Credit card interest is the fee you pay when you borrow money using your credit card. Every billing cycle, the card issuer will apply the credit card APR to any transactions eligible for interest charges.APR stands for annual percentage rate, and on credit cards, it serves as the interest rate. Most credit cards have a variable APR. With a variable APR, your interest rate can change over time. Most credit cards have a predetermined APR range, and your actual APR is determined in part by your credit score.Many credit cards also charge a different variable APR for each type of transaction (purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances). If you get behind on your payments, some credit cards may start charging a higher penalty APR.Not all transactions incur interest. Credit cards, including interest free credit cards, typically have a grace period between the date your statement is sent to you and its due date. If you pay off the full statement balance, you won't be charged interest on your purchases. And of course, you also won't be charged the interest rate if your card has a 0% intro APR offer in effect.Learn more: How to Lower Your Credit Card Interest Rate\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nWhat is a 0% APR credit card?\n\n\n\nA 0% APR credit card doesn't charge interest on purchases for an introductory period. If you carry a balance from purchases during that time, you won't incur any interest charges. You are required to make minimum payments because if you don't, the card issuer may cancel the zero-interest offer.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens after the 0% APR ends?\n\n\n\nOnce the 0% APR offer ends, the credit card APR standard will apply to the current balance and new charges. This means you'll start paying the regular interest rate on any remaining balance you couldn't pay off before the end of the intro period. That's why it's highly recommended you pay off your entire balance before the end of the intro 0% APR offer.\n\n\n\n\nHow long is the intro period for 0% APR credit cards?\n\n\n\nThe length of the intro period varies by card. Some credit cards offer a 0% intro APR for six months or less, but there are also intro 0% APR credit cards offering 18 months or longer without interest.\n\n\n\n\nHow can I avoid paying credit card interest?\n\n\n\nYou can avoid paying credit card interest on the best 0% APR credit cards by paying off your entire balance before the introductory period ends. This can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars compared to what standard credit card interest rates would cost you.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Lyle Daly\n and\u00a0Brittney Myers\nOur Credit Cards Experts","Article Date":"September 27, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"15":{"Article Title":"Best Rewards Credit Cards for October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/credit-cards\/best-rewards-credit-cards\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

I've got the spreadsheets as evidence! Above all, I have a passion for helping others find great credit cards that will improve their financial lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest rewards card overallWells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae CardRewards rate: Unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchasesWhy we picked it: It has the highest flat-rate, unlimited cash rewards that we've seen, plus a $200 welcome offer to add to its value.What we think you should know about the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card: If you strive for simplicity with your finances, this Wells Fargo card does the trick. You don't need to worry about activating bonus categories, or what purchases qualify for those categories. You earn 2% cash rewards for any type of purchase you put on this card.It's one of a few 2% back cards, but I think it's the best of the bunch. Other options dish out your cash back as 1% when you make a purchase and 1% when you pay it off, or restrict how you can use your rewards. This Wells Fargo card doesn't do either of those, so it's the easiest to use.Unlike those competitors, this card also has a welcome offer. You can earn $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months. Once again, it's a straightforward, high value benefit.Apply for the Wells Fargo Active Cash\u00ae Card on Wells Fargo's website.Pros:Earn 2% cash rewards in all spending categories$200 cash rewards welcome offer0% intro APR, 15 months from account opening on purchases and balance transfersCons:Charges a 3% foreign transaction feeWells Fargo has a below average customer satisfaction rating (based on J.D. Power survey)\n\n\n\n\nBest rewards credit card for travelBank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit cardRewards rate: Unlimited 1.5x points per $1 on purchasesWhy we picked it: It's one of few travel credit cards with no annual fee, and you can boost its rewards rate if you're in the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program.What we think you should know about the Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card: This is a solid rewards card that gets significantly better for Bank of America Preferred Rewards clients. If you have enough in qualifying assets with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch to qualify, you can join that program and get access to many benefits, including a higher rewards rate with Bank of America cards.The base rate for this card is 1.5 points per dollar, which is reasonable, although not spectacular. Bank of America Preferred Rewards clients get a rewards boost of 25% to 75%. That takes the rewards rate up to between 1.875 points and 2.625 points per $1.If you're a Preferred Rewards client, a Bank of America card is probably the right choice. It could be this one, or another one of the bank's rewards cards. If not, it's still a good card, but not necessarily a slam dunk.Apply for Bank of America\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card on Bank of America's website.Pros:Rewards boost of 25% to 75% for Preferred Rewards clients25,000 points welcome offer (worth $250 toward travel)0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases and balance transfersCons:Doesn't offer many travel benefits, which limits the value for frequent travelersRewards rate is average without rewards boost\n\n\n\n\nBest cashback credit card for bonus categoriesDiscover it\u00ae Cash BackRewards rate: 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories when you activate (up to $1,500 spending cap), 1% cash back on other purchases.Why we picked it: This Discover card is a great blend of high value and a user-friendly experience. It has a robust rewards program, earning 1% - 5% Cashback, plus Discover's innovative Cashback Match.What we think you should know about the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back: You really can't go wrong with a Discover card. They all keep fees to a minimum, with no annual fee or foreign transaction fee, and Discover even automatically waives your first late fee.The Discover it\u00ae Cash Back is my pick for the card issuer's best points card. It's one of few no annual fee cards to earn 5% back, in everyday spending categories that change every quarter. To make it even better, Discover automatically matches all the cash back you've earned at the end of your first year.I got this card last year, and what I love is that it can benefit just about anyone. With its rewards rate, it works well in a one-card wallet where you always pay with the same credit card. But if you have other rewards cards, like I do, it slots in seamlessly. Just find out where it's earning 5% each quarter, activate, and use it in those bonus categories.Apply for Discover it\u00ae Cash Back on the Discover website.Pros:5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categoriesUnlimited Cashback Match welcome offer0%, 15 months intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months, after which a go-to 17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR applies.No annual fee or foreign transaction feeCons:Standard cash back rate of 1% on non-bonus purchasesNot as widely accepted internationally as Visa or Mastercard\n\n\n\n\nAlso good cashback credit card: Citi Custom Cash\u00ae CardRewards rate: 5% cash back in top eligible spending category (up to $500 spending cap), 1% on other purchasesWhy we picked it: With most rewards cards, the card issuer picks the bonus categories. With this Citi card, you earn big bonus cash back in whichever eligible category you spend the most.What we think you should know about the Citi Custom Cash\u00ae Card: There aren't too many cash back cards that earn 5% back in any spending category. This Citi card does, for no annual fee, and that cash back rate is customized to fit your spending habits (hence the card name).Here's how it works -- every billing cycle, you earn 5% in your top eligible spending category, up to a maximum of $500 in purchases. There's a list of 10 eligible categories, including grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, home improvement stores, and live entertainment.If you go out to a few concerts one month, you can earn 5% back on your tickets. Have some projects around the house over the summer? You can earn 5% back on supplies at home improvement stores. It's a card that makes it easy to maximize your rewards.Apply for Citi Custom Cash\u00ae Card on the Citi website.Pros:5% cash back based on where you spend the mostWelcome offer of 20,000 ThankYou\u00ae Points (worth $200)0%, 15 months intro APR on purchases and balance transfersCons:Only one bonus category per billing cycle -- other purchases earn standard 1% cash back rateCharges a foreign transaction fee of 3%\n\n\n\n\nBest flat rate cash back credit cardCapital One Venture Rewards Credit CardRewards rate: Earn unlimited 2X miles on every purchase, every day. Earn 5X miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Why we picked it: You can earn big with this card, courtesy of the 2x miles per $1 and a welcome offer of 75,000 miles. Capital One Venture miles are also easy to use.What we think you should know about the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card: I used to have this card, and now use the premium version, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. Both are top-flight travel cards with a lot of benefits in common, and a couple of standout perks.For starters, you can earn miles very quickly with this card. It has a $750-mile welcome offer and earns 2 miles per $1 on purchases. Most travel cards have bonus categories, but earn 1% on non-bonus spending. Personally, I love having a travel card that I can rely on to get 2 miles per $1 everywhere.Another nice thing about Capital One Venture cards is the reward redemption options. Venture miles are redeemable for any type of travel purchase at $0.01 per mile. Or, you can transfer miles to Capital One's partners and potentially get much more value. I regularly save thousands on business-class airfare by transferring my Venture miles.Apply for Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card on Capital One's website.Pros:Earn an unlimited 2x miles per $1 on purchases$750-mile welcome offerMiles are redeemable for any type of travel purchase or transferable to Capital One's travel partnersTwo complimentary airport lounge visits per yearCons:Very limited bonus categoriesCapital One doesn't have as many travel partners as some other card issuers\n\n\n\n\nMore of our best credit cards for points:Though these cards didn\u2019t make our list above, they are still excellent rewards cards in our view.

But if you're going to trust our ratings, it's helpful to understand how we rate rewards cards.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at what our ratings mean.5 Stars: This is a top notch card that offers a combination of rewards rates, sign-up bonus, and perks that deliver lots of value for cardholders. If these cards have an annual fee, the value offered is typically much greater than the fee.4 Stars: These are solid credit cards. They don\u2019t offer quite as much value as five-star cards and annual fees may eat into more of the value than we\u2019d like. But these are still generally good cards to hold and specific features may make them great choices for certain users.3 Stars: This is typically the lowest rating you might see for a card on our site. This means that a card doesn\u2019t offer much value to users compared to other rewards cards. There\u2019s likely not a sign-up bonus and perks are probably very mediocre. There still could be a specific feature or element of the card that might make them worthwhile to certain users.We basically never have one- or two-star credit card ratings. It\u2019s not because we\u2019re trying to be kind to the credit card companies. It\u2019s because when a bank launches a credit card, it knows what\u2019s on the market and what a card will need to be competitive. So it\u2019s extremely rare to see a credit card launched that is just plain terrible.In other words, the worst credit cards we typically see are those we\u2019d call \u201cmediocre\u201d rather than \u201cbad\u2019.Creating rewards card ratingsWhen actually creating our star ratings for rewards cards, our aim is to focus on elements that will really matter to typical users. This means that our ratings will reflect how well these cards work out for many people, but not all. This makes those star ratings a good element to include in your research, but you still need to consider whether a particular card offer is a good fit for you.Here\u2019s a look at the specific elements we weigh when calculating our ratings.Rewards earning potentialThis is the most critical element of a rewards card, so we put a lot of focus here. To compare rewards cards that have varying rewards systems, we first consider whether the card provides flat-rate rewards or has a tiered system.For flat-rate rewards programs, we give our highest marks to cards with 2% cash back or the equivalent in points value. In tiered-rewards programs -- in which you earn different rates for varying spending categories -- our highest marks go to cards with 5 points or more on a key category like groceries, travel, or gas.Sign-up bonusSome rewards cards offer a welcome bonus to new cardholders. These chunks of cash back or points can amount to quite a bit and can drastically raise the value you can get from the credit card.Many cards with no annual fee offer sign-up bonuses with values in the $100 to $200 range. This is fairly average. Our top scores go to cards with sign-up bonuses that top $1,000. But be aware, you'll almost surely need to pay an annual fee for a bonus in that range.Annual feeMany consumers assume that no annual fee is always better. There are definitely big advantages to not paying an annual fee. However, cards with annual fees sometimes have rewards rates, sign-up bonuses or perks that make the fee well worth it.In our ratings, we give top marks to cards with no annual fee. And although premium credit cards with annual fees exceeding $500 can be a great choice for some cardholders, these cards get our lowest marks here.PerksPlacing a numerical rating on a credit card's perks is challenging. For one, the value of these features can be hard to calculate. And unlike cash back and points, the value of the perks can vary a lot from one cardholder to the next.So instead of trying to calculate specific values here, we put cards and their perks into buckets. Rewards cards with a wide variety of perks that are valuable to a broad number of cardholders get our top marks. Card offers with a nice selection of perks, but that are more focused -- imagine a travel credit card with free checked baggage and lounge access -- get somewhat lower scores. And those cards with a minimum number of perks score at the bottom.A few things we don\u2019t add directly to our calculationsHere are a few things that don\u2019t go directly in to our ratings calculation:Regular APR: We strongly believe that borrowing on credit cards at the standard APR is not a good idea. This doesn\u2019t apply at all times and for all people. But credit cards tend to have high standard APRs that don\u2019t make them good for borrowing. Therefore we don\u2019t include regular APR as a factor in our rating.Introductory APR offers: Some rewards cards also have introductory APR offers, such as a period of 0% interest on new purchases or a period of 0% on balance transfers. This can be a great benefit. However, if you\u2019re in need of a 0% period on purchases or a balance transfer, we suggest focusing on getting a 0% card that matches your needs, paying down your credit card debt, and then focusing on credit card rewards. That said, we do factor this into how we rate a card's overall perks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing your cash back card rewards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting the most out of a cash back card with a tiered rewards program or bonus categories system is a bit more straightforward than their travel-card cousins. Yes, you can typically squeeze more value out of the travel card programs, but for many people, the comparative simplicity of the cash back rewards is worth it.\n\n\n\nHere are some ways to make the most of a cash back credit card with rewards tiers, rotating categories, or bonus categories.Understand the higher-rate categories and whether they are right for youMaybe this goes without saying, but start by making sure you understand which categories offer higher-rate rewards. Depending on the card, the categories that could offer higher rewards rates might include:Travel spendingGasGrocery shoppingDining out \/ takeoutStreaming servicesDrugstoresOnline shoppingWhen you are clear on which categories offer higher rewards, you then need to consider whether those categories actually fit your typical spending.For instance, I do a lot of grocery shopping for my family, but much of it happens at Costco and Walmart. So if I want to earn higher rewards for that spending, I have to match it up to a card that has higher rewards for groceries, but doesn\u2019t exclude retailers like Walmart and Target or club retailers like Costco (as some grocery rewards programs do).When considering what this means for the card or cards you\u2019ll carry, you need to figure out what actually fits your lifestyle. I ended up with cards that specifically reward Costco and Walmart spending. This works well for me in my mix of cards, but the total number of cards you\u2019re juggling does increase complexity and the number of bills you need to manage. If you want to keep it simpler, sticking with a fewer number of cards that reward your very highest spend categories can work well.Know the terms of your rewards programRewards programs do have rules, so it\u2019s important that you understand those rules. Here are a few that are critical to keep an eye on:Bonus category caps: In some cases, high rewards rates in bonus or high-rate categories are capped. This might mean, for example, that the first $1,000 in a quarter can earn at the higher rate, but everything after that bumps down to a lower rate.Bonus category enrollment: Some cards, especially when it\u2019s a rotating bonus category, require that you enroll to actually get the higher bonus-category rates.Bonus category definitions: This may fall into the \u201cunderstand the rewards program\u201d bit, but it bears repeating. You will only get the higher rewards rates on spending that actually qualifies, so it\u2019s important to really understand what qualifies for certain bonus categories. If the bonus category is \u201ctravel\u201d it may or may not include flights, so you need to know that. If the category is \u201cgroceries\u201d it may or may not include big-box retailers like Target that also sell groceries, so it\u2019s important to know this as well.Planning big or non-urgent purchasesDon\u2019t spend money that you don\u2019t need to in order to earn rewards. That\u2019s an important one. But, when you do need (or want) to spend on something that isn\u2019t urgent, a little planning can make a big difference in your card rewards.If you have a cash back card with a tiered rewards program and no caps on earning rewards, this shouldn\u2019t be an issue \u2013 if the spending fits into a high-rate category, you should be good to go.On the other hand, if you have rotating bonus categories or a choice of bonus categories, larger, non-urgent purchases, you could delay those until you are in a window where those purchases would qualify for a higher rewards rate. Likewise, if the higher-rate category where your planned purchases fall has a monthly or quarterly cap, you could spread out the purchases so that you earn the higher rate for all of the spending, rather than getting capped after some and earning a lower rate on the rest.(As an added advantage of doing this, I\u2019ve often found that when I put off any spending, I tend to find that some of it wasn\u2019t as necessary as I thought it was. Extra savings win!)Using multiple cash back cardsOne other great way to maximize your rewards when using cash back systems is to use multiple cards. What this allows you to do is overlap cards so that you earn higher rates on more categories than any single card offers. This works a lot better for cash back cards than travel cards because you don\u2019t have to worry about sticking within points systems.The way I think about this is to start with a card with a solid everyday rate of cash back. This is the card I can pull out whenever my spending doesn\u2019t fit a high-rate category. Then I put together cards with higher-rate categories that fit my biggest spending categories. In my case, I have cards that offer higher rates on travel spending, gas, Costco shopping, Walmart shopping, Amazon.com shopping, non-Amazon online shopping, and dining out. One of my bonus category cards has a good enough baseline rate that I use it for the spending that doesn\u2019t fit these categories.Note that while many programs have high-rate categories that are chosen for you or pre-defined, some allow you to choose. This can be particularly helpful when trying to put together multiple cards that work together because you can use the choice-category card to fill in a gap from the other cards\u2019 programs.If you want to learn more about all of the ins and outs of cash back cards as well as all of our picks across the category, check out our page specifically on the best cash back credit cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to choose the rewards credit card that's best for you\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t want just any rewards card. You want the rewards card that\u2019s going to work well for you.Fortunately, there\u2019s one simple thing to consider that will help you make the best choice: How much effort will you put into your credit card?Rewards credit cards can be a very simple way to earn rewards and cash back for your spending. Or they can be a fun game of maximizing points and optimizing the use of perks.Here\u2019s a breakdown of the choices to make based on whether you want to keep it simple or get more involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep it simple\n\n\nOptimize\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards credit card type\n\n\nCash back\n\n\nPoints \/ Travel Rewards\n\n\n\n\nPoints program\n\n\nFlat-rate\n\n\nTiered\n\n\n\n\nAnnual fee\n\n\nNo\n\n\nMaybe (value dependent)\n\n\n\n\nPerks\n\n\nLess focus\n\n\nCarefully consider perks that give you value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose everything from one column. But the more you just want to sit back while your credit card earns rewards, the more you should choose from the \u201ckeep it simple\u201d column. And the more you want to earn the most rewards and get the biggest benefits from card perks, the more the \u201coptimize\u201d column may be right for you.\n\n\n\nCredit card rewards comparison\n\n\n\nNow that you know where you fall on the simple\/complicated spectrum, let\u2019s compare the four main types of rewards credit cards: cash back credit cards, travel rewards credit cards, points credit cards, and retail rewards credit cards.Travel rewards credit cardsIf traveling is one of your favorite things, travel credit cards are basically made for you. These cards earn rewards that you can use to cover travel purchases like airfare or hotel stays.These fall into the more complicated group of rewards credit cards, but can also be some of the most lucrative cards.There are two main sub-types of travel reward credit cards: general (or issuer branded) cards and co-branded cards.General travel rewards credit cards are great because they\u2019re more flexible. This type of travel card will allow you to rack up points on your travel even if you don\u2019t have a preferred airline or hotel. Points can often be used to book travel through issuer travel portals, converted into points in airline or hotel rewards systems, or even converted into gift cards or statement credits (though you won\u2019t get the best value this way).Co-branded travel rewards cards are the opposite. They are best when you do have a preferred airline or hotel. These cards are issued via partnerships between an issuing bank and an airline or hotel. These credit cards typically offer big points for booking with the co-branded airline or hotel and usually pay out in the form of that company\u2019s loyalty points system. They also often have perks directly related to the travel company \u2013 for instance, free checked bags for an airline card or room upgrades for a hotel card.Travel Rewards at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nRedemption options\n\n\nCan be very flexible, usually most value from travel purchases\n\n\n\n\nPerks and benefits\n\n\nCan include free checked baggage, airport lounge access, upgraded status, various types of travel insurance, rebates for travel-related fees\n\n\n\n\nSign-up bonuses\n\n\nOften included, typically an amount of points earned after spending a certain amount in the first few months\n\n\n\n\nAnnual fee\n\n\nThere are cards with no fee, the best rewards and perks are with cards that carry a fee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPARE MORE TOP PICKS: Best Travel Rewards Credit CardsCash back credit cardsCash back credit cards are generally as easy as it gets in the world of rewards cards. These cards typically give users a percentage of their spending back in the form of cash or something very similar to cash, like a statement credit.The two main types of cash back credit cards are flat-rate cash back cards and tiered or bonus category cards.If cash back cards are simple, flat-rate cash back cards are the simplest of simple. These credit cards pay a fixed rate of cash back on all purchases, regardless of the category. There\u2019s no need to track bonus categories or tiers, so this can be a great choice for those that want to earn rewards without having to do a lot of extra work.On the other hand, tiered or bonus category cash back cards offer different percentage payouts depending on the spending category. Cardholders may get a low flat rate percentage on most spending, for instance 1%, but then get a higher rate of 3% or even 5% on certain categories such as groceries, gas, or dining. It does require you to do a bit more work in order to match the card to your spending, but the high-tier and bonus category rewards for these cards usually allow higher cash back earning versus flat-rate cards.Cash back credit cards at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\nCash back\n\n\n\n\nRedemption options\n\n\nUsually statement credits, direct deposit, or gift cards\n\n\n\n\nPerks and benefits\n\n\nVaries by card but may include purchase protection, extended warranty, access to exclusive events or discounts\n\n\n\n\nSign-up bonuses\n\n\nOften included, typically in the form of a cash bonus or percentage match after spending a certain amount in the first few months\n\n\n\n\nAnnual fee\n\n\nMany cards have no fee, but some with higher cash back rates and better perks may have a fee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints credit cardsPoints credit cards are good if you like flexibility. With points cards you earn points that can be redeemed for a wide variety of rewards including travel, merchandise, gift cards, and cash back.It\u2019s possible to optimize how you earn points and then how you redeem them on the other end. This can help you make the most of the rewards you get back from your everyday spending. However, the flexibility of points credit cards also means that if you don\u2019t worry about how to optimally redeem your points, you can also convert to a simple cash-back reward.Like other cards in rewards category, points credit cards can be split into flexible points cards and category-specific points cards. Flexible points cards will usually offer a number of points per dollar spent across all of your spending. Category-specific cards will have either fixed or rotating categories that award more points for spending within certain categories.Points credit cards at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nRedemption options\n\n\nTravel, merchandise, gift cards, cash back, sometimes transfer to partner loyalty programs\n\n\n\n\nPerks and benefits\n\n\nMay include travel insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty, exclusive events or discounts, and various types of travel benefits\n\n\n\n\nSign-up bonuses\n\n\nOften included, typically a specific number of points earned after spending a certain amount in the first few months\n\n\n\n\nAnnual fee\n\n\nVaries widely; some cards have no fee, while others with premium perks and higher rewards rates may carry a fee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPARE MORE TOP PICKS: Best Cash Back Credit CardsStore credit cardsStore credit cards are a type of rewards card I often don't recommend for most people. A travel or cash rewards credit card is usually a much better deal, especially if you want a single-card wallet. But store cards are everywhere, and some have their uses if you shop at the store often, so it's worth knowing how they work.Most store cards earn rewards you can redeem with that store for a gift card. There are exceptions, like the Costco Anywhere Visa\u00ae Card by Citi, which earns cash back. And some store cards offer a discount on purchases or zero-interest financing instead of rewards.A store card can be \"closed-loop\" or \"open-loop.\" Closed-loop store cards only work at that retailer and any related brands. Open-loop store cards can be used with other merchants. Some stores only offer one of the two, and others offer both options. When stores offer both, they generally approve customers with lower credit scores for closed-loop cards. Applicants with better credit can qualify for open-loop cards.For example, let's say you apply for a T.J. Maxx credit card. Any of the following could happen:You're approved for the TJX Rewards\u00ae Credit Card. This is a closed-loop card, meaning you can only use it at T.J. Maxx and its other brands.You're approved for the TJX Rewards\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\u00ae. This is an open-loop card that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted.You're not approved for any of the T.J.

Always pay by card so you earn rewards on your spending.Stick to your budget: A common mistake is making unnecessary purchases, using rewards to justify it. Don't let credit card rewards convince you to overspend.Pay off your credit card every month: Credit card interest almost always costs more than any rewards you earn. Avoid this by always paying your entire statement balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can you do with credit card rewards?\n\n\n\nAfter earning credit card rewards, you can redeem them through the card's rewards program. The ways you can redeem them depend on the card. Here are the most common redemption options for the best points credit card:Get cash back, as a statement credit on your credit card bill, a direct deposit to a bank account, or as a check.Use them for travel through the card issuer's travel portal, as a statement credit toward previous travel purchases, or by transferring them to airline or hotel loyalty programs.Redeem them for store gift cards.Redeem them for products or services.When you log in to your online account, there should be a clear option to redeem rewards. Choose this to see what your redemption options are and pick the one you want.Check how much value you get with each redemption method. People sometimes assume they get the same value no matter how they use their rewards. This is a common mistake that can cost you money. The value often depends on how you use your rewards. For example, if your card earns travel points, you may also be able to redeem them for cash back, but at a much lower rate per point.\n\n\n\nShould I get a rewards credit card?\n\n\n\nYou should get a rewards credit card if you have a good credit score and will pay the bill in full every month.Rewards cards are usually a great choice. You're going to pay for purchases anyway. Why not use a rewards card to get something back on that money you're spending? There are only a couple of situations where the best points credit card isn't the right fit:You don't have a good credit score: Learn how to increase your credit score and work on that first. It usually takes a FICO\u00ae Score of at least 670 to get any of the best rewards credit cards. By improving your credit, you can qualify for rewards cards that offer much more value.You won't pay in full every month: Every month you carry a balance, the card issuer can charge you credit card interest. The cost of interest almost always outweighs your rewards.Here are the pros and cons of having a rewards credit card:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsEarn rewards on purchasesMany offer welcome bonusesTypically include complimentary shopping and travel protectionsCan build your credit when you consistently pay your bill in full\n\n\n\n\nConsOften have high APRsCan encourage you to spend more moneyMay charge an annual feeTop rewards cards are only available to consumers with good credit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives to the best credit cards for rewards\n\n\n\nYour financial situation may call for a different type of credit card.

Every eligible purchase adds to your rewards balance, and you can then redeem your rewards with the credit card issuer.\n\n\n\n\nHow can I do a credit card rewards comparison?\n\n\n\nTo compare rewards credit cards, look at their rewards rates, bonus offers, annual fees, and any additional benefits they offer. These are the features that have the most impact on the value a card offers.You may also want to decide on one type of rewards card first, such as a travel card or a cash back card. If you know you want a specific type of card, then you can save time by only looking at cards in that category.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the best credit card for rewards?\n\n\n\nThe best rewards credit card has a redemption method that offers the most value. This can vary depending on which rewards credit card you have. For example, travel cards usually provide the most value when redeeming rewards for travel, whereas cash back cards are designed for cash back redemptions.When you have a rewards credit card, make sure you review the different redemption methods so you can choose the best one.\n\n\n\n\nHow can I make the most of a rewards credit card?\n\n\n\nTo make the most of a rewards credit card, use it for every purchase to earn as much back as you can. However, don't make unnecessary purchases just because your card earns rewards. Follow your usual spending habits. Last but not least, always pay the full statement balance on your credit card to avoid interest charges.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a rewards credit card?\n\n\n\nA credit card with reward points earns cash back, points, miles, or some other type of reward for purchases. The amount you earn depends on the card and, in some cases, the spending category. For example, there are cards that offer a flat rate of 2% on purchases. Others offer higher rates in some categories, such as 3% on groceries.Every eligible purchase adds to your reward balance. So, if you spend $100 on a card offering 2% cash back, you'd earn $2 in rewards. You can redeem rewards when you have enough to meet the redemption minimum, if there is one. Fortunately, many of the best rewards credit cards don't have a minimum, so you can redeem rewards anytime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk the experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Shipman, CPA\n\nAssistant Professor for Accounting, Mount Aloysius College\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nWith high gas prices, should consumers consider using credit cards that provide rewards to pay for gas?One should never get a credit card for a \"non-credit reason.\" In the tax world, we have the saying, \"The tax tail should never wag the economic dog.\" This means that a company should not do something solely for tax reasons, but rather, should have a good business reason for a course of action. The same can be said of credit cards. This said, if you are opening a new line of credit during a time of high gas prices (whether it be because you need a credit card or an additional credit card, or have to close one for a good reason and are now looking for another), getting and using a credit card that provides rewards to pay for gas could be better than the other usual reward opportunities! What should consumers know when deciding between a general cash back credit card vs. a gas company credit card?Consumers should know the details of each reward opportunity. For example, I would want to know what I can and cannot get cash back on, how often I can get cash back, at what rate I get cash back, if there is a limit on how much cash I can get back, and if there are any other restrictions on the card. This line of reasoning applies to gas company credit cards as well: Is it just the one company I can get my gas bill reduced at? How often can I use it? At what rate is my gas reduced? Is there a limit on how much my gas bill is reduced, and are there any other restrictions on the card? Lastly, remember, even though the gas company credit card sounds like a good idea now, it can only help with gas, as opposed to the general cash back credit card likely providing cash back for use at your discretion. Are there any benefits or drawbacks to companies that advertise money back per gallon?The obvious benefit is that you can reduce your gas bill. As far as I can tell, that is where the benefits end. One drawback is that you may get a gas company credit card for a company that routinely has more expensive gas than one of its competitors in your area. A similar drawback is that by getting this credit card, you are likely influencing yourself to buy most, if not all, of your gas from one company, which may or may not always be the best economic decision. This is similar to loyalty cards for gas chains (Sheetz, Wawa, etc.), with the difference that loyalty cards do not really have consequences. Credit cards do have consequences, and it is important to read the fine print on gas company credit card offers like any others, as you may find the gas company card has a lower interest rate (benefit), but you may also find (and this sounds more likely, in my opinion) a higher interest rate. Whatever you decide, always remember to monitor your credit card bills carefully, and if possible, pay off your balance every month! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Stasio\n\nAssociate Professor, Marketing, Merrimack College\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nWith high gas prices, should consumers consider using credit cards that provide rewards to pay for gas? It is important to understand that prices fluctuate given market conditions. Right now, gas prices along with many other consumer products are experiencing abnormally high prices. This is due to a number of factors including unusually high demand, labor shortages, and supply chain irregularities, all causing inflation. Decisions involving credit card usage tied to gas purchases should involve this understanding. So, using credit cards that reward gas purchases will be advantageous in the short run, but not so much when gas prices return to a more normal range. Of course, if consumers have different credit cards to use, then they can provide the best return on purchases after gas prices come down and they offer a better return on their buying behavior.What should consumers know when deciding between a general cash back credit card vs. a gas company credit card?The answer to this question is provided in question one. The key is to understand market conditions and their impact on prices. Generally speaking, consumers should have a few credit cards. For example, not all businesses accept either Discover Cards or Amex Cards. Depending on the amount of expenditures people experience each month and whether they carry a balance or pay off the total amount each month, consumers can decide which cards to use that will provide them the best return on their purchases. It is important for consumers to understand their own purchase behavior and judiciously use their credit cards. Gas company credit card decisions should be made in this context.Are there any benefits or drawbacks to companies that advertise money back per gallon?Companies that advertise money back per gallon are really speaking to heavy users of gasoline. They would include people who drive long distances to work each day or people who use their cars to conduct business that involves much travel. Salespeople, truck drivers, etc., fall into this category. If companies do not target their messages to these groups of people, then they are wasting their marketing\/advertising dollars. With social media platforms and the use of digital marketing techniques, companies should learn how best to reach these people and get the most from their marketing dollars.

Landlords can use your credit to decide if they'll rent to you. Employers can use it for hiring decisions. In most states, your credit can even determine how much you pay for car insurance. As you can see, a bad credit score means a lot more than just paying higher interest rates on loans.On a positive note, anyone can improve their credit. But to do that, you'll need to understand what causes bad credit in the first place and what it takes to build a better credit score.\n\n\n\nWhat is considered a bad credit score?\n\n\n\nBad credit scores range from 300 to 579 using the FICO system and 300 to 600 using the VantageScore system. FICO is the most widely used scoring system, and VantageScore is the second most popular. If you're new to credit scores, it's good to understand that there's more than one scoring system -- and that your credit score is a number that ranges from 300 to 850.When you have a bad credit score, you won't have many credit card or loan options. You'll likely only qualify for credit cards and loans that are aimed at applicants who have bad credit.After bad credit, there's fair credit, which is a FICO\u00ae Score between 580 and 669 and a VantageScore between 601 and 660. You can get approved for more financial products once you have fair credit, although you'll still have a more limited selection than consumers with good or excellent credit.\n\n\n\nHow to check your credit score\n\n\n\nKnowing your credit score is essential if you want to monitor your financial health and take steps to improve your credit. Plus, it can help guide you in choosing the right credit card to apply for as you begin to consider card options. The good news is it's simple to check your credit score.One way to do so is to use a free credit monitoring and credit score service. You'll need to sign up for one of these services and log in to view your score. Examples include Experian CreditWorks\u2120 Basic and Discover\u00ae Credit Scorecard. These services are free to use and provide you with a FICO\u00ae Score. As a note, Discover doesn't require you to be a cardholder to use their service.Knowing your score can give you a better understanding of where your finances stand and help you make more informed decisions so you can improve your credit score.\n\n\n\nFactors that cause bad credit\n\n\n\nCertain factors can cause bad credit. Here are some examples:BankruptcyIf you've filed for bankruptcy or plan to do so, this can be one of the most significant factors that result in bad credit. Depending on the type of bankruptcy you've filed for, this negative mark will stay on your credit for seven to 10 years. It's important to consider this before filing for bankruptcy.Missing payments and late paymentsPayment history makes up 35% of your credit score. If you're missing payments or making late payments, this can cause bad credit. If you've made payment mistakes in the past, you can make changes from now on. If you want to improve your credit, be sure to pay your bills in full and on time.High credit utilizationYour credit utilization ratio is how much of your available credit you're using. If you have a high credit utilization (using more than 30% of your total available credit), this can negatively impact your score. It's best to use less of your available credit if you want a higher credit score. Using less available credit also shows that you have a smaller percentage of outstanding debt.Having no credit or minimal creditIf you have little to no credit history, that can be a factor that leads to bad credit. Your best bet is to begin building credit now because the length of your credit history will increase over time, which looks good to creditors.\n\n\n\nWhat are the effects of bad credit?\n\n\n\nThe biggest consequence of bad credit is that if you need to apply for anything that requires a credit check, you're much more likely to get declined. Examples include:Credit cardsPersonal loansAuto loansMortgagesHome rental applicationsEven if you get approved, the terms will be worse than they would be for a borrower with good or excellent credit. You may get a credit card, but it won't have much in the way of rewards or benefits. A landlord could rent to you, provided you pay a much larger security deposit.When it comes to loans, it's best to show you an example. Here's how much a 60-month auto loan for $25,000 would cost, using national APR averages, depending on your credit:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFICO SCORE\n\n\nAPR\n\n\nMONTHLY PAYMENT\n\n\nTOTAL INTEREST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent (720 or higher)\n\n\n4.272%\n\n\n$463\n\n\n$2,809\n\n\n\n\nPoor (589 or below)\n\n\n16.735%\n\n\n$618\n\n\n$12,065\n\n\n\n\n\nData source: MyFICO.\n\n\n\nExcellent credit would save you $155 per month, and $9,256 in total interest over the life of the loan.Those are the most obvious effects of bad credit, but they're far from the only ones. Here are some additional challenges you could deal with:Many utilities providers charge security deposits to new customers with subpar credit.Most states allow car insurance companies to charge higher premiums to drivers with lower credit scores.Employers can run a credit check before deciding whether to offer you a job.\n\n\n\n\nCan you erase a bad credit history?You can't completely erase a bad credit history -- at least not overnight. But, you do have a couple of options when it comes to removing specific concerns:If something is inaccurate on your credit report and it's having a negative impact on your credit, you can dispute it. You can do this by contacting each of the three credit bureaus to file an official dispute. The Federal Trade Commision has a sample letter that you can use. Your best bet is to send your letter by mail, so that you can track it and have a record of it being sent.If you have a late payment mark on your credit report and you've been a loyal customer, it's worth reaching out to your creditor to request a goodwill adjustment. They may agree to remove that late payment mark, which can improve your credit history. You can make a request by phone, but sending a letter is an even better idea. A letter gives you a chance to explain in detail why your payment was late.You can also negotiate with your creditor if you're looking to have a poor mark removed and they're not willing to remove it right away. For example, if you still have outstanding debt with the creditor, you may ask if they will remove the poor mark if you pay the balance in full right away.These are a few ways to erase parts of your bad credit history. If none of these options work for you, you'll need to continue to work on improving your credit history by making smart financial choices.\n\n\n\nWhat to look for in a credit card for bad credit\n\n\n\nThe most important thing to look for in a credit card for bad credit is its fees, but you should also check its APR, its minimum and maximum security deposits, and what kind of credit limit you can expect. Here's an explanation of each item.FeesMost credit cards have fees, but what you don't want are unavoidable fees. Fees for cash advances or balance transfers shouldn't scare you off from a specific credit card -- you can easily avoid both by not making those types of transactions.Fees that should make you think twice are annual fees, monthly maintenance fees, and any other regular fees the card issuer charges no matter what. These are expenses you don't need, especially from a card that probably doesn't have many benefits.APRIdeally, you'll pay your full statement balance and never incur interest charges. But it's also nice to have a credit card that won't gouge you in interest if you ever need to carry a balance. You can calculate your interest payments by using this calculator.Minimum\/maximum security depositWith secured credit cards, you should check what the minimum and maximum security deposit amounts are. The one that's more important for you depends on how much you have saved for a security deposit.If you don't have much saved, you'll need to ensure you can pay a card's minimum deposit amount. If you have solid savings and you'd like to pay more up front for a higher credit limit, then you'll need a card that allows a high maximum deposit.Credit limitIf possible, you should research the credit limits a card offers. This information is usually available with secured credit cards, but you can sometimes get it for an unsecured card as well.You don't need a ton of available credit. But if your credit limit is too low, it can be difficult to maintain a low credit utilization ratio, and that can affect your credit score.RewardsNot all credit cards for bad credit offer rewards, but some do. As you consider your options, you may want to prioritize cards that offer rewards because they can provide value to you.You can expect to earn anywhere from 1% to 3% cash back for most credit cards for bad credit with rewards potential. It's worth noting that cards that offer higher rewards rates may have a cap on how much you can earn. You may be able to earn unlimited rewards at a lower earning rate. Remember, some cards for bad credit offer no rewards at all.\n\n\n\nHow to get a credit card with bad credit\n\n\n\nIf you want to get a credit card with bad credit, your best bet is to see if you can get prequalified for a card. That way, you can make sure you will be eligible for a card without hurting your credit score with a credit check, only to find that you don't qualify.While it depends on the card issuer, most of the major credit card companies have prequalification pages on their websites that let you check offers you'll likely be approved for.To find out if you prequalify, you'll just need to enter some basic personal information. Most card issuers ask for at least some of the following:Full nameAddressDate of birthLast four digits of your Social Security numberOnce you've submitted the required information, you'll see any cards that you have a good chance of qualifying for with that card issuer. Remember that this doesn't guarantee your application will be approved.If you're not able to get prequalified for a credit card for bad credit, it's a good idea to take some time to work on improving your credit. Ready to get started? Here's how to apply for a credit card and get approved.\n\n\n\n\nHow to improve your creditYou can improve your credit score with time and effort. Remember that there is no instant fix. You can't build credit quickly, but you can build it up over time. In order to do this, you need to understand the elements that make up your credit score. Working on each of these can allow you to improve your credit and increase your credit score.Here are the five factors used to calculate your FICO\u00ae Score and how you can get high marks in each one:Payment history (35%): On-time payments are the key to excellent credit. While you can't undo previous late payments on your credit file, you can avoid late payments in the future. That's the number one habit you need to raise your credit score.Credit utilization (30%): Your credit utilization is the sum of your credit balances divided by your combined credit limit. For example, if you have one credit card with a balance of $200 and a limit of $500, then your credit utilization is 40%. The lower you can keep this number, the better. A good goal is to always have your credit utilization below 30%. If yours is higher, then you should focus on paying off debt.Length of credit history (15%): Creditors will obviously consider a borrower who has had a credit card for 20 years to be less risky than one who has only been using credit for three months. The best way to improve in this area is to open a no-annual-fee card and keep it open forever.Credit mix (10%): It gives you a slight credit score advantage if you have both revolving credit, such as credit cards, and an installment loan on your credit file, instead of just one of the two. But since this has only a small impact on your credit score, you shouldn't take out a loan solely to boost your credit. You can attain an excellent credit score even if you only use credit cards.New credit inquiries (10%): When a company looks at your credit report to make a credit decision, this inquiry is reported on your credit report for two years. Credit inquiries only affect your FICO\u00ae Score for one year, though. Don't avoid opening a new account just because of the small impact to your credit score, but don't open a bunch of accounts in quick succession, either.\n\n\n\nCan I get a credit card without a bank account?\n\n\n\nHaving a bank account is not a requirement when applying for a credit card. However, application requirements can vary by credit card company, so you may need a bank account to get approved for certain cards.Even though a bank account isn't required to get a credit card, it does make your credit card payments more convenient. Just about every credit card company lets you pay online if you have a bank account. You can make an online payment that counts toward your bill that same day, so you don't need to worry about making a payment days in advance. Another option is to set up autopay.If you don't have a bank account, you'll need to find an alternate payment method. There are other options available. For example, you could pay by mail using a money order, or you could pay in cash if your credit card company has a branch in your area. But there's nothing as convenient as paying online. To simplify your payments and better protect your savings, it makes sense to open a bank account.\n\n\n\nWhat is the easiest credit card to get with bad credit?\n\n\n\nThe easiest credit card to get when you have bad credit is a card that is marketed towards people with bad credit. These cards have less strict requirements in place for applicants. You'll be more likely to get approved for a credit card for bad credit if you have a lower credit score, poor credit history, or limited credit.Some bad credit cards have easier approval odds than others. Here is one option:OpenSky\u00ae Secured Visa\u00ae Credit Card: While this is a secured credit card and will require you to make a deposit before using it, this card has a low annual fee and is a good choice for people who are rebuilding their credit or who have very limited credit. There is no credit check requirement when going through the application process -- making it a good option for many.If you've unsuccessfully tried to get other secured cards with no annual fee or any other credit card for bad credit, this one may be an easier and better option for you to consider.\n\n\n\nAlternatives to credit cards for bad credit\n\n\n\nIf a credit card for bad credit isn't for you, there are some other options to explore.Secured loan: A secured loan is a type of loan you can get when you put something of value, such as a car or home, up for collateral. If you're having trouble qualifying for a personal loan, a secured loan could be a good option to help you rebuild credit. However, it's important to remember that the lender can sell your collateral to pay back the loan if you miss payments. For more options and information, check out the best personal loans for bad credit.Subprime credit card: In fact, you may receive offers in the mail inviting you to apply for these. Subprime credit cards typically have fees that end up costing you a lot of money. Take, for example, the First Access VISA\u00ae Credit Card. There's a $95 program fee to open the card. You pay a $75 annual fee the first year. That drops to $48 annually going forward, but in year two, you also pay a $6.25 monthly servicing fee, totaling $75 annually.To avoid all these extra fees and to know what you're getting into before you apply for a card, check the fee disclosure of any card you're considering. If there are fees just to keep the card open, it's probably not worth the cost.Want to learn more?

Is there a range or situation when it might be more beneficial?I\u2019m not a believer in building credit simply for credit\u2019s sake. Still, having good credit is about more than just getting the best interest rate on a loan.Your credit rating affects your car insurance, so if you\u2019re getting ready to purchase a vehicle or switch car insurance policies, you should meet with a financial counselor.Your credit history might be part of a background check the next time you apply for a job, so meeting with a financial counselor before switching jobs or careers could be helpful in landing your dream position.Most property managers will set minimum credit scores for applicant eligibility, so speaking with a financial counselor before moving could help you get into a better place to live. Plus, your credit rating determines how much, if any, you will have to put into a utility\u2019s security deposit.If you\u2019re thinking about buying a home, you should reach out to a financial counselor ahead of time to put together a plan for building your credit rating. It could mean the difference of tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand dollars of interest saved over the life of a 30-year mortgage. Unfortunately, most homebuyers seek credit advice from their realtor or, at best, their mortgage officer. Realtors tend to have no formal training in consumer credit issues. Loan officers, while they work with credit, focus more on selling and processing loans than on building a customer\u2019s credit. I\u2019ve heard nightmare stories from neighbors and clients of bad credit advice given by a well-intentioned but poorly informed lender or realtor. Seek out a financial counselor or a credit counselor instead.If you\u2019re preparing to get married, you might benefit from a meeting with a financial counselor to create a plan to build or rebuild your credit for upcoming changes to your housing, such as moving into a new apartment or purchasing a home.For those struggling in their marriage or relationship with a partner, meeting with a financial counselor can bring an unbiased and dispassionate view to discussions about money in the relationship.Anyone headed for a divorce should meet with a financial counselor to understand the potential credit-related problems surrounding the household separation and even the divorce decree. Too many divorcees believe creditors are bound by the divorce decree, but they aren\u2019t. If your names are on the account, you are ultimately responsible for making the monthly payment, regardless of what the divorce decree says.If you\u2019re getting ready to graduate from college or are a recent college graduate, meeting with a financial counselor can help bust harmful myths about how and when to build your credit.The best time to reach out to a financial counselor is now, whether:things seem to be going well financially but you\u2019d like unbiased, third-party insight to continue that progressthings are going poorly with your credit, and you\u2019re not sure whom to trust with your questions about rebuilding your rating or cleaning up your historyyou\u2019re just getting by but you know you have room to improve your credit scoreTypically, consumers tend to reach out to financial counselors in times of crisis, such as:when they\u2019re about to or have already missed a bill paymentwhen they've been contacted by a collection agencywhen they're facing foreclosure or repossessionwhen they've maxed out their credit cards due to medical emergencies or consumer overspendingHow long does it typically take to improve credit with a financial counselor?Depending on the type of issue dragging your credit down, you might see your credit score improve in a matter of a couple weeks or six to nine months. Correcting errors on your credit report can have an almost overnight impact on your rating. Using free products like Experian Boost can improve your credit immediately. Overcoming the negative impacts of years of spending issues and payment histories, though, can take up to a year or more to counter with positive credit-related behaviors.How do financial counselors differ from advisors and planners?Unfortunately, the basic term \u201cfinancial counselor\u201d has no licensing requirements, no copyright or trademark protection, and no exact definition. It has different meanings in different situations. Although a bit oversimplified, financial counselors tend to work with their clients to improve their day-to-day, month-to-month financial behaviors and choices, such as budgeting, credit building, debt elimination, and saving for emergencies and goals. In many cases, anyone can call themselves a financial counselor and not be in violation of any state regulations or licensing standards. That\u2019s one reason I would always recommend you look for a specific type of financial counselor. Accredited Financial Counselors\u00ae (AFC), on the other hand, offer counseling on budgeting, credit building, debt elimination, and consumer behaviors through private practice or through a sponsoring organization, such as a military base, university, or nonprofit. They must have 1,000 hours of experience and pass a rigorous test in order to use the title of AFC. (Disclaimer: I\u2019m an AFC.)Finally, financial advisors and planners are in the business of offering advice about or selling products to help their clients build wealth long-term. While financial advisors and planners require licenses to recommend and sell securities, insurance, and other financial products, AFCs do not sell or recommend products for commissions. What are common misconceptions around working with a financial counselor?One common misconception about working with a financial counselor is they only work with the extremes: the very rich or those in financial need. The truth is that most households would benefit from working with a financial counselor. According to Career Builder, nearly 80% of workers earning less than $100,000 a year live paycheck to paycheck even before the coronavirus pandemic. Plus, the Federal Reserve reports that 2 in 5 American households are unable to come up with $400 in an emergency without affecting their ability to pay their regular bills. Therefore, most American adults could use financial counseling, whether it involves building or rebuilding their credit rating, accelerating their debt elimination plans, or putting barriers in place to stop impulse spending.Another misconception is that financial counselors charge large fees. Many Accredited Financial Counselors (AFCs) provide their services at no charge through a nonprofit, military base, or other organization. Others have set up their own private practice, giving them greater latitude in the services they provide. Still, their fees are reasonable for the short- and long-term financial benefits they provide.Many people think meeting with a financial counselor would be too embarrassing or humiliating. But there is no shame in wanting to improve your situation. For example, AFCs are trained to avoid making the consumer feel ashamed of their previous behavior. Shame and embarrassment do not lead to positive changes. AFCs focus on future goals and objectives, not on past mistakes or choices.Some people believe they have to get super organized with all their financial documents and bills before meeting with a financial counselor. Actually, financial counselors can help simplify the process of organizing household finances by helping to prioritize tasks and by providing recommendations for helpful apps and other tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nCan I get a credit card without a bank account?\n\n\n\nYes, it's possible to get a credit card without a bank account. However, some card issuers may require you to have one in order to be approved for a card. It'll be easier to pay your credit bill if you do have a bank account, and you may qualify for more cards with one.\n\n\n\n\nCan I get a credit card if I've declared bankruptcy?\n\n\n\nYes, you can get a credit card after bankruptcy. It's important to remember that bankruptcy does negatively impact your credit situation. Because of this, you may qualify for less credit cards. You may need to apply for a secured credit card, which requires you to pay a deposit before using the card. In many cases, this deposit is equal to your starting credit limit. Another option is to apply for a subprime credit card. These cards have many more fees attached to them when compared with other cards. Because of these extra fees, these kinds of cards usually aren't the best choice.\n\n\n\n\nHow can I improve my credit score?\n\n\n\nThere are a few ways that you can improve your credit score. Continuing to make on-time payments, keeping your credit card utilization low, and always paying at least the minimum amount due are all good ways to improve your financial habits and improve your credit score.If you don't yet have a credit card, getting one is another way to improve your score. If you have a low score, you can apply for a credit card for bad credit. Make sure that you use the credit card regularly, even for small charges, and make all payments on time. With time and effort, you can improve your credit score.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Natasha Etzel\nOur Credit Cards Expert","Article Date":"August 15, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"17":{"Article Title":"Best High Yield Savings Accounts of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/banks\/best-savings-accounts\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Image source: Liz Wilson\n\n\n\n\nAPY: up to 4.50%Bonus: up to $250 (with direct deposit)Why we picked it: Not only does this savings account offer a strong APY, but the linked checking account has a very impressive APY for a checking account too. Plus, there\u2019s the opportunity for a $250 bonus \u2013 a very rare perk.What we think you need to know about SoFi Checking and Savings:For those that are planning to set up direct deposit with their new account, we think SoFi Checking and Savings is hard to beat. The savings account offers a high APY of up to 4.50% with direct deposit, which is very competitive with other accounts on our list (though others don\u2019t require direct deposit). You can also earn the maximum APY by depositing $5,000 or more every 30 days.Meanwhile, the linked checking account offers a 0.50% APY. Frankly, it\u2019s the kind of combo that could make it worthwhile to switch banking relationships.Another unique feature of this offer is the bonus: users can earn a $250 cash bonus when they set up direct deposit, and when qualifying direct deposits within 25 days total $5,000 or more (the bonus drops to $50 if direct deposits in 25 days are at a lower level of $1,000.00 - $4,999.99)First-hand review from one of our employees, who uses SoFi personally:\"I was interested in an online bank since I\u2019d seen that a lot of them offered higher APYs than traditional banks. We chose to go with SoFi because they offered some of the highest rates and had good reviews. Overall, they have been a good fit for us. Transfers are seamless and the app is easy to navigate and keep track of activity with. My only complaint so far has been that the first time I tried to deposit a check (an insurance reimbursement), they temporarily locked our account due to not recognizing the check issuer, and the process of getting it unlocked with customer service was frustrating. Since then I have had no issues.\"-Liz Wilson, Software Developer here at The Ascent, a Motley Fool ServicePros:One of the rare accounts to offer a bonus (with direct deposit)Competitive APY on both savings and checking (with direct deposit)No account feesBaseline FDIC insurance of up to $250,000, and they also offer the SoFi Insured Deposit Program which allows for FDIC insurance on deposits up to $2 million (opt-in required)Cons:Direct deposit is required for the bonusDirect deposit or large monthly deposits are required for the higher APYClick here to open an account: SoFi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Express National Bank\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Express Savings Platform.

We can\u2019t fault people that may not want to squeeze every last penny out of their interest rate, and would rather opt for a company like American Express with a strong reputation and one that is likely not going to play games with your APY. Further, this account sports no monthly fees and 24\/7 customer support.In terms of what could be improved, as an online bank it offers no ATM card; funds can be withdrawn or transferred through its website or mobile app.First-hand review of American Express\u00ae High Yield Savings from one of our employees, who uses the account personally:\"I\u2019ve personally been using my American Express savings account for over 3 years. I chose Amex because of their competitive rates coupled with the strength of a well known brand.

Image source: Ethan Mellin\n\n\n\n\nAPY: 4.30%Bonus: Up to $200 with qualifying depositsWhy we picked it: While it may not be the highest APY on this list, Discover Online Savings features an excellent rate and we think this account excels pretty much everywhere else too.What we think you need to know: we think Discover Online Savings is a great pick for anyone who wants an account with a high APY that they don't need to think about. While it's not exactly the highest rate at every point in time, you can feel good that you\u2019ll be earning a near-top-of-market rate for a while to come. You\u2019ll also avoid many common bank fees and despite it being an online bank, you have plenty of deposit and withdraw options.Discover has a limit of 6 withdrawals and transfers per month, which is pretty good, and they are not even enforcing that rule right now.For a limited time, earn $150 when you open your first Discover Online Savings account and deposit at least $15,000 within 30 days of the account open date. You can earn $200 with a similarly qualifying deposit of at least $25,000. Enter offer code TMF923 when applying. This offer ends 12\/14\/23. See Discover's web site for details.First-hand review of Discover Online Savings from one of our employees, who uses the account personally:\"I chose Discover Online Savings first and foremost because of its high APY. However, I am also a Discover Credit Card & Checking account-holder, so having everything in one easy-to-use mobile app makes it extremely easy to manage my finances. That being said, I've recently noticed other online savings accounts with slightly higher APYs.\"\u2013Ethan Mellin, Senior Performance Marketing Manager here at The Ascent, A Motley Fool servicePros:Extra safety of a rock-solid brand and reputationHigh APYNo monthly feesFDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Slightly higher APY is available elsewhere, though those accounts may have less rate stabilityNo ATM cardClick here to open an account: Discover Online Savings\n\n\n\n\nCIT Platinum Savings and CIT Savings Connect:\n\n\n\n\n\nMy screenshot of the CIT Savings Platform. Image source: Author\n\n\n\n\nAPY:CIT Platinum Savings: 5.05% APY for balances of $5,000 or moreCIT Savings Connect: 4.65% APYWhy we picked it: These are no-frills high-interest savings accounts offering some of the highest APY\u2019s on the market today.Important note: CIT offers two high-yield savings accounts: the CIT Platinum Savings account with a higher APY but with a deposit requirement of $5,000, and the CIT Savings Connect account with a slightly lower APY but only requiring $100 to open the account. So those depositing over $5,000 should go with CIT Platinum Savings, and those depositing under $5,000 should go with CIT Savings Connect.My first-hand review:I have personally been using CIT Bank savings accounts for years, and I\u2019ve had a good experience with the company overall. The high APY (annual percentage yield) is what attracted me to the account originally, and I\u2019m still earning a very competitive rate there. This is also the main reason our experts included it on this list of our best high yield savings accounts.My first-hand experience with the platform and its features has been good, though it is important to note that the features are relatively simple and you shouldn\u2019t expect all the bells and whistles of a larger bank (the screenshot above that I took shows what the platform looks like). For me, this is worth the trade-off for the higher interest rate. I\u2019ve found that it is easy to wire money in and out of the platform.My only real negative thing I\u2019ve experienced with CIT is that they lowered the APY on my account out of the blue last summer. This happened when they created a new account, the Savings Connect account you see here, which became the CIT account with the highest rate. It was easy enough for me to switch over to Savings Connect to earn the higher APY, but I didn\u2019t appreciate them not auto-enrolling me in this new account. This isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for me as this hasn\u2019t happened again, CIT has been good otherwise, and the APY is strong. But if you open an account just make sure to keep an eye on it so you\u2019re earning the highest APY.Pros:High APYNo account feesUnlimited transfers and withdrawals ($250k limit per day)FDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Past history of APYs for existing accounts not always being increased when new accounts with higher APYs are launched (though this has not been an issue lately)There is a minimum deposit required to open an account, though it\u2019s just $100\n\n\n\n\nCapital One 360 Performance Savings\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital One Performance Savings Platform. Image source: Matt Koppenheffer\n\n\n\n\nAPY: 4.30%Why we like it: Like the other accounts on this list, Capital One 360 Performance Savings sports a strong APY. But what sets it apart from many others is branch locations and full-service banking support.What we think you need to know: Capital One 360 Performance Savings is a great high yield savings account option for anyone looking for a strong brand, easy-to-use platform, and a plethora of branch locations (if you live near one). It offers a highly competitive interest rate, though not always fully at the top of the market.In terms of negatives, while you can take advantage of Capital One branches if you live near one, if you don\u2019t then it could be tricky to access your funds in person (though you can transfer money to a Capital One 360 Checking account for easier access.)First-hand review of Capital One 360 Performance Savings from one of our employees, who uses the account personally:\"My family and I have enjoyed the convenience of banking with Capital One overall. The accounts are easy to use, the interface is simple, money moves quickly, and while savings rates aren't top of the market, they're much higher than mainline banks.\"\u2013Matt Koppenheffer, General Manager here at The Ascent, a Motley Fool ServicePros:Branch access if you live near oneExtra safety of a rock-solid brand and reputationNo monthly feesFDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Slightly higher APY is available elsewhere, though those accounts may have less rate stabilityNo direct ATM access if you don\u2019t live near a branchClick here to open an account: Capital One 360 Performance Savings\n\n\n\n\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs Online Savings Account\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus By Goldman Sachs Online Savings Account platform. Image source: Johnnie Weathersby III\n\n\n\n\nAPY: 4.30%Why we picked it: We think Marcus is a strong option for anyone wanting a high APY, robust platform, and all backed by a big name bank (Goldman Sachs).What we think you need to know:There\u2019s a reason Marcus won our award for Best Online Savings Account. It features a high APY, no monthly maintenance fees, and excellent U.S. based customer support (during business hours). There is no minimum balance requirement to open an account and like all accounts on this list, it is FDIC insured for at least $250,000 per depositor.One negative of Marcus is that it does not offer direct ATM card access, so if that\u2019s important to you then we think it\u2019s best to look elsewhere on this list.First-hand review from one of our employees, who uses Marcus by Goldman Sachs personally:\"I love the competitive rates at Marcus and they update the return account holders see on a regular basis. Transfers to and from Marcus are pretty simple and help you avoid wire transfer fees that you may experience with other banks. The referral benefits are great for existing account holders, which can be a pretty sweet deal if you want to help your family and friends out, too.\"\u2013Johnnie Weathersby III, Senior BI Data Analyst\/Architect here at The Motley FoolPros:Won our award for Best Online Savings AccountCompetitive APYNo maintenance feesFDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Slightly higher APY is available elsewhere, though those accounts may have less rate stabilityNo ATM card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nWhy should you use a high interest savings account?\n\nSwitching to one of our best savings accounts could earn you a 10x higher interest rate on your cash: all of our best online savings accounts here pay 4.00% APY or more, while the average U.S. savings account pays a paltry 0.40% APY, per the FDIC. And your money is safe since all the accounts here are FDIC insured up to at least $250,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we picked the best high-yield savings accountsWe used a comprehensive process for reviewing and researching the top saving accounts, which added up to well over 100 hours of our experts\u2019 time. There are obvious things we look for first: these accounts need to have a high APY, be FDIC insured, have low or no fees, low account minimums, and a strong brand reputation. We also read the fine print to make sure things like transfer and withdrawal limits are acceptable -- after all, what good is a high yield savings account if you can't get your money out when you need it?Additionally, we personally use most of the accounts recommended here so we are deeply familiar with the ins-and-outs of them, and feel as comfortable recommending them to you as we do our friends and family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee more about how we rate the best high yield savings accounts by expanding this section.\n\n\n\nWhen you're looking for a high-interest savings account, the account's APY isn't the only factor to consider. Keep the items listed below in mind when you compare savings accounts to avoid surprises down the road.FDIC insurance: Most banks offer FDIC insurance. It's unlikely you'll ever use it, but it's risky not to have it. If your bank fails and your funds aren't insured, you lose your money. That's why we think the best savings accounts are ones with FDIC insurance.High APY: APYs fluctuate from bank to bank and over time, so there's no solid definition of a high APY. You don't need the highest rate on the market, but you should choose one that's close to the highest around. This will earn you more interest.Low fees: Fees can eat into your profits and possibly cost you more than you're earning in interest. Check your bank's fee schedule to learn about any costs associated with the account, and avoid a monthly maintenance fee if you can. Also, check to see if there's a minimum balance requirement on the account. The best savings account for you might have a few fees -- but, in an ideal world, you can meet whatever is required to waive those fees.Accessibility: Make sure you're comfortable with the ways you can deposit money into your savings account and withdraw it when necessary. You likely also want a bank with an online portal and mobile banking so you can manage your funds remotely. The best bank to open a savings account at is one you're comfortable interacting with, whether that's online, in-person, over the phone, or at an ATM.Welcome Offers: Some bank accounts also offer bonuses. If you're looking for a high-yield savings account with a bonus, check out our list of Best Bank Bonuses to see our top picks.And remember -- choosing a bank is personal. You're the one who ultimately knows which account is the best savings account for your needs, preferences, and lifestyle!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy you can trust usHere at The Motley Fool, we\u2019ve been helping people grow their wealth since 1993.

You can open one with most banks and credit unions, but always compare interest rates between banks before you open an account.If you're not sure where to start looking for an online savings account, check our list above to find out which banks we believe offer the best online savings accounts.Our industry banking experts have weighed in below for how they\u2019d personally recommend leveraging and choosing the right savings account for you!\n\n\n\nHow to open a savings account online or in person\n\n\n\nTo open a savings account, fill out an online application form or visit a branch (if your chosen bank has them).Requirements to open a savings accountThis process should be similar whether you open a savings account online or at a brick-and-mortar bank. You will need to provide some personal information, including:Your addressYour Social Security numberA government-issued ID, like a driver's license or a passportIf you are opening a joint savings account, both parties will need to provide this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nMinimum deposit to open account\n\nYour bank may also require a minimum deposit to open the account. The minimum deposit may be different from the ongoing minimum balance required to avoid monthly maintenance fees. If you're making this minimum deposit by transferring funds from another bank account, you'll need to know its routing and account number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to know about savings accounts\n\n\n\nWith a savings account, your bank pays you interest on your money -- usually every month. How much interest you earn is determined by the account's annual percentage yield (APY). You'll earn more interest with an account that has a high APY.The best online savings accounts offer both convenience and high interest rates. A larger balance or a higher savings account interest rate results in more interest.It's always good to compare savings account interest rates before opening an account. The best savings account interest rates can add a nice bump in your funds without much effort on your part.\n\n\n\nHow much money should you keep in a savings account?\n\n\n\nA savings account is a great place to keep your emergency fund, as well as funds for any short-term savings goals (like a vacation or a down payment on a home).Here's what the experts we spoke with had to say about how much you should have in savings:\n\n\n\nPeople should generally keep a collective balance in their checking and savings accounts equal to three to six months' worth of living expenses.\n\nDr. Jeff Jones, PhD, CFA\u00ae, CFP\u00ae, CPA (Inactive), Department Head, Finance and General Business Department\n\n\n\n\nif you drive an old car, or know that your roof is getting up there in age, or work in a job with a lot of volatility in hours or susceptibility to layoff, then you'll need more emergency savings.\n\nMatthew S. Rutledge, Associate Professor of the Practice, Boston College Economics Department\n\n\n\n\nPros and cons of savings accounts\n\n\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages that come along with savings accounts. It's important to consider these factors when you're looking for the best savings account for your lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros of savings accountsEarning interestSaving as much as you likePaying bills with automatic bill payKnowing your money is insured with the FDIC\n\n\n\n\nCons of savings accountsMonthly maintenance fees (sometimes)No ATM card or checks (usually)Fees for extra withdrawals after your first six withdrawals at some banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nCan you write checks from a savings account?\n\nMost savings accounts don't offer check-writing capabilities or a debit card -- so you have to transfer the funds to a checking account or withdraw cash in order to spend money. Often, banks limit the number of free withdrawals you can make in a month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare types of savings accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you compare savings accounts, think about what you'll use the account for. Do you want to be able to withdraw your money at any time to cover unexpected expenses? Are you saving up for a major goal over several years, and could use every dollar of interest you can earn? Answering these questions will help you compare savings accounts and decide which is best for your needs.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at the common types of savings accounts you'll run into.Traditional savings account: These accounts are usually easy to open and easy to access. But APYs tend to be pretty low, and most of these accounts carry maintenance fees if your balance falls below a certain amount.High-yield savings account: These are similar to traditional savings accounts, but they offer much higher APYs and most don't have monthly maintenance fees.Money market account: Money market accounts offer the APYs of a savings account with the easier access of a checking account. However, these accounts usually have higher minimum balance requirements than typical savings accounts.Certificate of deposit (CD) account: Certificates of deposit (CDs) usually offer some higher APYs than any of the savings accounts discussed above. If you're looking for the best APY on a savings account, CDs are definitely worth considering. But you have to agree not to withdraw your funds for the full CD term (which could be months or years).Specialty savings account: A specialty savings account is a savings account that's geared at a certain group of people or goals. Examples include kids' savings accounts, health saving accounts, and education savings accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nLearn more about savings account interest rates\n\nIs a high-yield savings account worth it? What is a good interest rate, anyway? And how do you compare savings account rates?If you're asking these questions, you're not alone. Here are some FAQs we've answered about savings account interest rates:How do you calculate the interest you'll earn on a savings account?What is a good interest rate for a savings account?What is the interest rate on my current savings account?Why are interest rates so low on savings accounts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline vs. traditional banksIf you don't want to open a savings account online, don't worry -- you can get a high interest savings account at a brick-and-mortar bank too. You might just need to look around a little more, since high interest savings accounts are more rare at brick-and-mortar institutions.Savings accounts at online banks are slightly different from savings accounts at traditional banks. Here are some of the key differences between savings accounts at online and brick-and-mortar banks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService\n\n\nBrick-and-mortar banks\n\n\nOnline banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rates\n\n\nGenerally low\n\n\nGenerally high\n\n\n\n\nHours of operation\n\n\nFixed to the bank's schedule\n\n\nFlexible to your schedule\n\n\n\n\nATM networks\n\n\nExtensive ATM networks\n\n\nCoverage varies\n\n\n\n\nCustomer service\n\n\nIn-person service in addition to call centers\n\n\nCall centers often extended or 24\/7 hours\n\n\n\n\nAccount access\n\n\nBranch withdrawals, transfers, and ATMs\n\n\nTransfers and ATMs\n\n\n\n\nFDIC insured\n\n\nYes\n\n\nUsually\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSavings Account TerminologyHere are a few key terms to know before you open a savings account. These are important terms for online savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, and high-yield savings accounts.\n\n\n\nAPY: This stands for \"annual percentage yield.\" People often use this term interchangeably with interest rate, but the two aren't the same. APY takes into account the actual interest rate as well as how often that interest compounds. A higher APY means more interest for you.When we say \"compare savings account rates,\" we mean \"compare APYs.\"Monthly maintenance fee: This is a fee your bank charges to maintain your savings account. Some banks, especially online banks, don't charge this fee, and others will waive it if you meet certain requirements.Liquidity: Liquidity refers to how easy it is to turn your money into cash. Highly liquid accounts make this simple, while low-liquidity accounts make it a lot more challenging to get cash when you need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidance from Savings Account Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew S. Rutledge\n\nAssociate Professor of the Practice, Boston College Economics Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jeff Jones\n\nJeffrey S. Jones, PhD, CFA\u00ae, CFP\u00ae, CPA (Inactive), Department Head, Finance and General Business Department\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nWhat is a high-yield savings account?\n\n\n\nA high-yield savings account is a savings account that offers a much higher APY than average. Some high-yield savings accounts offer APYs that are 10-times the national average or more. This means your savings can grow more quickly.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a savings account?\n\n\n\nA savings account is a type of bank account designed for money you don\u2019t plan to spend immediately. You can open one of these with any bank or credit union, and you can usually deposit as much as you\u2019d like to the account. You deposit money in-person, or through direct deposit, electronic transfer, check, or some other method.\n\n\n\n\nIs my money safe in a savings account?\n\n\n\nYes. Savings account funds are FDIC insured up to $250,000 per person per bank, so there's no risk of losing money if your bank goes under. The risk of losing money with a savings account is pretty slim. It could be possible if you incur a lot of fees, your identity is stolen, or a hacker gains access to your bank account.As long as you are aware of the fees your bank charges (and ways to avoid them) and you protect your personal and account information, your savings account should only make you money.\n\n\n\n\nHow do savings accounts work?\n\n\n\nSavings accounts earn interest over time on money you don't plan to spend immediately. How much interest you earn depends on the balance in your savings account and the interest rate.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the bank do with my savings account money?\n\n\n\nBanks use your savings to fund loans for their customers. Borrowers then pay interest on the loan, and your bank sends some of that interest to your savings account.\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I look for in a savings account?\n\n\n\nThe best savings accounts have:High APY: The top savings accounts should include a high APY in range with our picks.No monthly maintenance fee: Most of the best savings accounts won't charge a monthly maintenance fee.FDIC insurance: Whether you're putting money aside to build an emergency fund or wanting to earn more interest, security is important.\n\n\n\n\nHow much interest will $1,000 make in a year?\n\n\n\nA $1,000 deposit could earn about $35 in interest in a year, if you put it in a high-yield savings account with a 3.50% APY. The amount of interest your money earns depends on the bank account and its APY. In a brick-and-mortar savings account with a 0.30% APY, a $1,000 deposit would only earn about $3.Savings rates can -- and do -- go up and down. These changes will affect the amount of interest you earn.\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of deposit account earns the most interest?\n\n\n\nThese types of accounts often earn more than traditional savings accounts:High-yield savings accountCertificate of deposit accountMoney market accountEven among these types of accounts, you will find a wide range of interest rates offered. Generally, the highest interest rates are found at credit unions and online-only banks.Some banks and credit unions offer tiered interest rates. For example, you might earn a relatively high rate on your first $1,000, and then a smaller rate on the amount above that. Or your bank might pay a modest rate on the first $25,000 and a higher rate on the amount above that. Beginner savers will definitely do better with the first type of account. Once you start building your savings, you can use an online savings calculator to figure out where you'll earn more.\n\n\n\n\nCan you keep an emergency fund in a savings account?\n\n\n\nYes, a savings account (especially a high-yield savings account) is a great place for your emergency savings. Here's why:Your emergency fund should be easily accessible to you. Keep your emergency savings in an account that allows you to transfer or withdraw money quickly. A certificate of deposit account is not recommended because no one can predict when financial emergencies are going to happen, and you might have to pay a penalty if you withdraw money from a CD before the maturity date.Your emergency fund should be protected from losses. It's generally not advisable to put your emergency fund in the stock market or other account that could experience fluctuations, because you wouldn't want the value to be in a dip when you have a financial emergency.Your emergency fund should grow. This is why you shouldn't keep your money under the mattress, even if you feel that it would be safe from theft. A high-yield savings account allows you to maximize your earnings. Stashing cash -- or leaving your money in a traditional savings account -- means you forego the opportunity to earn as much as possible in interest.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Brendan Byrnes\n and\u00a0Kailey Hagen\nOur Banking Experts","Article Date":"October 2, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"18":{"Article Title":"Best Checking Accounts of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/banks\/checking-accounts\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Even better, no fee checking accounts are becoming more and more common.Most checking accounts today make it easy to access your money, offer flexible withdrawal options, and are FDIC insured. And the best checking accounts have low or no fees, a high APY (so your money is making money), and ATM reimbursement. Ready to compare checking accounts? We've scoured the banking world to find the accounts below -- our picks for the best checking accounts.\n\n\n\nBest checking accounts\n\n\n\n\n\nOur quick picks\n\nIf you're short on time, here are the two top checking accounts we highly recommend.Both of these checking accounts earn interest.

A higher APY means more interest.ATM reimbursement: Some of the best online checking accounts reimburse ATM fees charged by other banks.Convenient ATM or branch locations: Your local bank on the corner is convenient, but it's not the only option. Some online banks have massive ATM networks and easy methods to make deposits, even with cash.When you compare checking accounts, look at all of the above factors to get the whole picture for each account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note from our head of product ratings, Brian Frey\n\nThe checking accounts we rank highly all meet these standards:Issued by well-respected financial institutionsBoast competitive APYs or cash back rewardsOffer the ability to add on a savings accountThese features are critical to a positive checking experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep reading to see the checking accounts we recommend (and why we think they're the bees' knees):\n\n\n\nCompare the best checking accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow The List [+]\nHide The List [-]\n\n\n\n\n0.50% APY:\n\nSofi Checking and Savings\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nup to 3.30% APY:\n\nAxos Bank Rewards Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0% APY:\n\nDiscover Cashback Debit\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nup to 1.10% APY:\n\nQuontic High Interest Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n1.00% APY:\n\nAmerican Express Rewards Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0% APY:\n\nBetterment Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nUp to 0.25% APY:\n\nAlly Spending Account\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0.25% APY:\n\nAlliant High Rate Checking\n\n\n\n0.45% APY:\n\nSchwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0.10% APY:\n\nCapital One 360 Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0.25% APY:\n\nEverBank Yield Pledge\u00ae Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nUp to 0.15% APY:\n\nLendingClub Rewards Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffer\nAPY\nMinimum to Earn APY\nNext Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSofi Checking and Savings\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\nRating image, 4.75 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Savings accounts tend to earn more interest, which make them perfect for saving money over long periods of time.\n\n\n\nSavings accounts typically have higher APYs, which makes them a better choice for an emergency fund or other cash you don't anticipate using anytime soon but don't feel comfortable investing. But savings accounts also have restrictions that limit the number of withdrawals you can make per month and the ease of access you have to your money.Checking accounts are intended to be spending accounts used for everyday purchases. They have fewer limitations on the number of payments or withdrawals you can make each month. But they usually don't have a high APY like savings accounts do, even if they are high interest.For more on the difference, be sure to check out our beginner's guide to banking.RELATED: How to Open a Checking Account\n\n\n\n\nAre checking accounts free?Yes and no. When people talk about free checking accounts, they are usually referencing checking accounts that don't charge a monthly maintenance fee. Most accounts still charge other fees, though.\n\n\n\nEven if you aren't charged a monthly maintenance fee, you could be hit with other fees. So not all \"free checking accounts\" are actually free. Here are some of the more common fees you might see:Monthly maintenance fee (also known as the service charge, among other names): This is the most common recurring checking account charge. It often ranges from $5 to $15, but can vary widely. Fortunately, banks often waive this charge if a customer meets certain standards. These can include a minimum number of transactions on the account's debit card, setting up recurring direct deposits from an employer, or meeting a minimum ongoing balance amount.Overdraft fee: This classic charge has been a staple of the checking account for many years. Should you spend more money than what you've got in the account, you'll be hit with an overdraft fee. $30 per incident is roughly the going rate. Banks don't typically waive overdraft fees, though some online checking accounts don't charge them.ATM fee: Banks like to charge ATM fees if you draw funds from cash machines that aren't theirs. A standard hit is $2 or $3 per transaction, but these can be much higher in certain locations, especially abroad. The ATM owner may charge their own fees as well.To be clear, not all checking accounts (especially online checking accounts) charge all of these fees. For example, many of our picks for best high-interest checking accounts don't have any monthly maintenance fees or overdraft fees, and some even go so far as to reimburse customers for ATM fees charged by other banks.So the best checking accounts with no fees are the checking accounts with no fees you will incur. That said, if you can find a no fee checking account (as in, you can avoid any fees the bank charges, such as overdraft fees) you can save a lot of money. If you're looking for a free checking account, make sure to keep an eye on all the possible charges -- not just monthly maintenance.RELATED: Best Free Checking Accounts\n\n\n\n\nDo checking accounts earn interest?The best checking account offers include at least a low APY, but they can be hard to find. Most banks don't offer interest on their checking accounts.\n\n\n\nThis is particularly true of banks with brick-and-mortar operations. Keeping branches open is expensive and resource-draining, and the prevalence of checking accounts make them a prime target for cost cutting.There are, however, exceptions to this no-interest standard. Interest-bearing checking accounts exist.Unfortunately, these accounts often have relatively high opening and\/or minimum ongoing balance requirements. The effort it takes to hit those marks, plus the funds they tie down, are not worthwhile for many customers, especially because many of the best interest-bearing checking accounts only offer a low APY.You can sometimes find better APYs if you open a checking account online. Online-only banks have more wiggle room to pay interest since they don't bear those brick-and-mortar costs. It's not unusual to see interest-bearing online checking accounts. Even with the best online checking account, interest rates are generally much lower than what you'll find with online savings accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur reviews: Best Checking Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRatings Methodology\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 4.75 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

However, the account is one of the best online checking accounts in the industry, with no account fees whatsoever, a competitive APY, and as much as $2 million in FDIC insurance for people with high-balance accounts.One of the biggest benefits of having a combo account is being able to seamlessly transfer money between the checking and savings account, and the latter offers up to 4.50%. There are some unique benefits such as free checks, and SoFi typically offers excellent welcome bonuses, as well as some of the best referral bonuses in the business. Account owners also get free ATM access at over 55,000 ATMs in the Allpoint Network, as well as access to their direct deposits up to two days early.Of course, the account isn't perfect. Not everyone wants both a checking and savings account, and some competitors don't require any special activities (like direct deposit) to take advantage of the best interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Competitive APY on checking balancesNo feesATM access at more than 55,000 locationsFree checksExcellent welcome and referral bonuses\n\n\n\n\nCons:No standalone checking accountDirect deposit is required for top interest rates as well as overdraft protection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our SoFi Checking and Savings review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2023 Award Winner\n\n\n\n\n\nAxos Bank Rewards Checking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Axos Bank Rewards Checking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 4.25 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

With cash back on every purchase, it's possible to earn even more than you could with a typical checking account APY without changing your habits at all. The fact that Discover has done away with many common checking account fees only adds to its appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Full Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover Cashback DebitBest for: Customers who don't always keep high balances but use their debit cards often.The Discover Cashback Debit account can be a great checking account alternative that offers especially good value for customers who use their debit cards to make purchases often.The account offers 1% cash back on debit card purchases, which is among the best debit card reward rates of any checking account (or checking alternative) on our radar. However, there's a limit -- only purchases up to $3,000 per month earn rewards, so this effectively sets a $360 annual cash back limit. The account has no monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, stop payment fees, or nonsufficient funds (NSF) fees. And the account offers the ability for customers with direct deposit to get their paychecks up to two days early.Discover Cashback Debit customers have access to more than 60,000 fee-free ATMs, and there is no minimum balance or account activity requirement. And one particularly unique perk is that Discover provides your checks absolutely free.One of the biggest drawbacks is that the Discover Cashback Debit account doesn't pay interest. However, the debit card spending rewards can certainly make up for the APYs offered by competing checking accounts, especially if you use your debit card often. If you regularly need access to your cash, Discover limits ATM withdrawals to $510 per day.The Discover Cashback Debit account is FDIC insured up to $250,000 per depositor and can be a great checking alternative for customers who generally don't maintain a high enough balance for interest to make much of a difference, but who use their debit cards regularly to make purchases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Debit card cash back rewardsNo monthly feesNo overdraft or NSF feesAccess to over 60,000 ATMs\n\n\n\n\nCons:Monthly cap on cash back rewardsDoesn't pay interestNo banking branches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our Discover Cashback Debit review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuontic High Interest Checking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Quontic High Interest Checking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 4.00 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

As long as you make at least 10 qualifying debit card purchases of $10 or more every month, you'll qualify for the highest APY (up to 1.10%) -- if you don't, the account will pay just 0.01%. This isn't the only reason Quontic is best for active checking account users: There's an inactivity fee of $5 per month that could be assessed to idle accounts.Customers can access ATMs through several partner networks for fee-free cash withdrawals at more than 90,000 ATMs. As an online bank, depositing cash directly into the account isn't possible, but this is quite standard for banks without branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:One of the higher checking account APYs in the industryNo monthly maintenance feesFree ATM usage at more than 90,000 machines worldwide\n\n\n\n\nCons:Requirements must be met to earn interestInactivity fees for idle accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our Quontic High Interest Checking review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Express Rewards Checking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

There are no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements for the account. You can redeem your points for deposits into your Amex Rewards Checking account and there is no cap on how many points you can earn. The account offers a high APY and earns rewards but those are limited to certain options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Express Rewards CheckingBest for: People who want to earn a competitive yield on checking account balances, as well as rewards for debit card spending.American Express is best known for its card products, and for good reason. But it is also a fully functional FDIC-insured bank, and offers a range of consumer deposit accounts, loan products, and more. This includes the American Express Rewards Checking account, which can be an excellent choice for people who want an online checking account that pays interest on their money.It isn't too common for checking accounts to pay interest, even for online checking accounts, but the American Express Rewards Checking account does. To be sure, its APY isn't competitive with what you'll find through online savings accounts and CDs, but it can allow you to earn some money on the cash in your checking account.One of the most unique features is the debit card rewards program. Checking account customers earn 1 Amex Membership Reward point for every $2 in eligible purchases, with no maximum reward amount. Like most online checking accounts, there is no monthly maintenance fee and no minimum balance requirement. While Amex doesn't have branches or its own ATMs, customers have access to their money through 37,000 MoneyPass ATM locations throughout the United States.One way American Express stands out over other online checking accounts is its customer service. American Express offers account holders 24\/7 customer service over the phone or live chat. And with American Express' highly rated mobile app, it could be a smart choice for people who like to manage their finances on the go, especially those who already have a credit card relationship with Amex.There are a few potential drawbacks, however. The American Express Rewards Checking account is only offered to Amex's U.S. Card Members who have been customers for at least three months. And there are some services Amex doesn't offer, such as outgoing wire transfers or online bill payment, so it might not be the best choice if you regularly use these things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Interest-bearing with competitive APYDebit card rewardsNo monthly feesNo minimum balanceGreat customer service\n\n\n\n\nCons:Available for Amex Card Members onlyNo physical branches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our American Express Rewards Checking review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetterment Checking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 3.50 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

So the spot it's earned toward the top of our list despite this fact should tell you something.Betterment Checking has no monthly maintenance fees or overdraft fees, two features that are rather common with online-based checking accounts. However, it offers unlimited ATM fee reimbursement and reimbursement of foreign transaction fees, and the latter is a rare benefit. So, depending on how often you need to access cash and how often you travel internationally, these perks can make up for the lack of interest on the account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:No monthly maintenance feesNo overdraft feesUnlimited ATM fee and foreign transaction fee reimbursement\n\n\n\n\nCons:Does not earn interestOnline-only bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our Betterment Checking review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlly Spending Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 4.50 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

This makes it an excellent choice for customers who live near Capital One branches and frequently need to deposit cash or make other in-person transactions.Capital One gives access to its own branded ATMs as well as tens of thousands of others around the U.S., but unlike some other top-rated checking accounts, it doesn't reimburse for out-of-network ATM fees.

It pays a competitive (but not top-tier) APY of 0.25% on checking account balances, and there's no minimum balance or direct deposit requirement to take advantage of it.EverBank not only offers a large network of ATMs available fee free to its checking account customers but offers at least $15 in monthly ATM fee reimbursements for all account holders.

It charges no monthly maintenance or overdraft fees, and offers unlimited ATM fee reimbursements anywhere in the world. And while virtually all checking accounts come with a debit card, the LendingClub Rewards Checking offers as much as 1% cash back on debit card purchases for account holders with an average balance of $2,500 or more, or monthly direct deposits of at least $2,500.Perhaps the biggest negative is that the LendingClub Rewards Checking only pays interest to account holders with $2,500 or more in their accounts, and reserves its best APY (which is still on the lower end for online checking accounts) for customers with $100,000 or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:No maintenance or overdraft feesEarly paycheck access with direct depositUnlimited ATM reimbursementsExcellent debit card rewards\n\n\n\n\nCons:Minimum balance to earn interestOther top-rated checking accounts pay higher yieldsOverdraft fees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead our LendingClub Rewards Checking review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump To\n\n\n\nHow to choose the best checking account\n\n\n\n\nTypes of checking accounts\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a checking account?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to ask when choosing a checking accountYou'll probably use your checking account a lot, so choosing the right one is important. Here are the basic questions you should ask to compare checking accounts:What checking account features do you need?Do you want a debit card? Overdraft protection? Mobile banking?How much will your checking account balance be?Many checking accounts have maintenance fees, but these fees can be waived if you keep a certain amount of money in the account.What are the most convenient banks for you?Is there a bank near your grocery store? Is there a bank with a top-rated mobile app?What checking account fees do those banks charge?You can usually find the bank's fee schedule online, or you can ask for it in-person at a branch.What checking account bonus offers are available to you?Some banks offer sign-up bonuses to new customers who fulfill certain requirements.Identifying the best bank for a checking account can be tricky, but it'll make a major impact on your overall experience. If you're opening an account with someone else, make sure the account works for them, too. The best joint checking accounts will make life easier -- for both account holders.If you can't decide between two similar checking accounts, look for extras that make one stand out. For example, some banks offer cash back on debit card purchases or out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements. Also consider what's convenient for you when choosing the best bank for a checking account: Is there a branch or ATM near your home? And remember: The best checking account offers for you might be different from the best checking account offers for your neighbor. Think about your lifestyle before deciding which account has the best bonus for your money.\n\n\n\nTypes of checking accounts\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the most common types of checking accounts.There's a lot of different types, but most of the differences come down to the perks each account offers. To find the best checking account offers for you, ask yourself what you'll need from your checking account. Do you want to earn interest? Avoid maintenance fees? Get a checking account bonus when you sign up? The answers to these questions will help you compare checking accounts and find the one that fits your lifestyle.Traditional checking accountTraditional checking accounts are available through most banks and credit unions. They usually don\u2019t earn interest, and some charge monthly maintenance fees if your balance is too low. But it's usually pretty easy to access your funds. Most give you check-writing capabilities and a debit card so you can directly withdraw your funds when you need them. And if you choose a brick-and-mortar bank, you'll be able to get money at any bank branch as well.Premium checking accountPremium checking accounts offer special perks, like lower fees or monthly out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements. But these are usually only available to customers who open multiple accounts with the same bank. Brick-and-mortar banks offer these as a way of competing with the fee-free checking accounts offered by online banks.Student checking accountStudent checking accounts are geared at college students, usually up to age 25. Most of the time, these accounts don't have monthly maintenance fees and they allow for online and mobile banking just like traditional checking accounts.RELATED: Best Student Checking AccountsSenior checking accountSenior checking accounts are targeted to adults who are 62 or older in most cases. These accounts may have lower monthly maintenance fees or they may not charge a monthly fee at all for account ownership. Their features are usually pretty similar to traditional checking accounts.Interest-bearing checking accountInterest-bearing checking accounts enable you to earn a modest annual percentage yield (APY) on your checking account funds. Rates are usually lower than what you typically see with high-yield savings accounts, and you may need to maintain a high minimum balance to qualify for interest. The best high-yield checking accounts are often online, because online banks don't have as many overhead costs to cover as brick-and-mortar banks.Business checking accountBusiness checking accounts are designed for companies rather than individuals. There are often several options business owners can choose from, depending on the features they need and the number of monthly transactions they make.Checkless checking accountCheckless checking accounts are traditional checking accounts that don\u2019t offer check-writing capabilities. Banks sometimes offer these as a fee-free or low-cost alternative to traditional checking accounts. One of these might suit you as long as you're comfortable paying for items a different way.Rewards checking accountRewards checking accounts offer special perks, like cash back on debit card purchases. This is more common with online banks. It may not appeal to everyone, but if you use your debit card often, you might earn more money this way than you would with a traditional interest-bearing checking account.Private bank checkingPrivate bank checking accounts are reserved for the ultra-wealthy. These customers usually have large balances, and banks give them dedicated representatives to assist them with their needs.Second chance checkingSecond chance checking accounts are for individuals who have previously had their bank accounts closed, usually due to a failure to pay fees or because they were using their accounts to commit fraud. This makes banks reluctant to work with them again. These second chance accounts usually have more stringent application requirements and there's often a monthly fee you can't waive.\n\n\n\nWhy should you have a checking account?\n\n\n\nMost American adults have checking accounts, and there's a good reason why it's such a popular place to keep money.Here are a few reasons to open a checking account, whether it be a high-interest online checking account or one from a traditional brick-and-mortar bank:Easy spending: If you have an emergency expense, an unexpected bill, or even just a fun shopping spree -- it's easy to spend money out of a checking account. Some options for spending out of a checking account include checks, debit cards, online banking, and mobile wallets. Checking accounts are also great for combining finances. The best joint checking accounts allow you to pay shared bills, like rent or insurance, with ease.(Usually) no restrictions: Believe it or not, most other bank account types have restrictions on spending. With a savings account, you can usually only make six withdrawals each month. And with a certificate of deposit (CD), you can't take money out at all without paying a penalty (unless your CD has matured -- but waiting for it to mature can take months).Protection: Most checking accounts have insurance covering up to $250,000 in deposits. Banks have FDIC insurance, and credit unions have NCUA insurance, with each offering coverage up to the same amount. In the unlikely event that your bank shuts down, insurance would cover it. Also, consumer fraud protection services are standard and free of charge in many checking accounts, both nationwide and at local banks.\n\n\n\nWhat is a checking account?\n\n\n\nA checking account is a bank account designed for spending. Most checking accounts come with a debit card. Account holders can also take advantage of online bill pay services.It contrasts with a savings account, which is intended for -- yes -- saving. Savings accounts usually don't have debit cards, because banks don't expect you to spend the money in your savings account.You can open a checking account for yourself, or you can open a checking account with someone else. An account with more than one account holder is called a joint checking account. If you're searching for the best joint checking account, you'll need to take into consideration both you and the other prospective account holder's needs, habits, and lifestyles.You can open a checking account online or in-person, through both traditional brick-and-mortar banks and an increasing number of online financial institutions (like that new banking app your coworker won't stop raving about).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nHow many checking accounts should I have?\n\nMost people have just one or two checking accounts, but like many personal finance categories, it depends on you. In addition to a standard individual checking account, many couples have joint checking accounts, and many business owners also have business checking accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey checking account terms to know\n\n\n\nHere's some important checking account terminology you should be familiar with:Debit card: A debit card is a payment card that's linked to a checking or savings account. It's usually (but not always) Visa- or Mastercard-branded. Unlike a credit card, which allows you to borrow money and pay it back later, debit card transactions are approved based on the current balance of your account, and the money is immediately deducted.PIN: Short for \"personal identification number,\" a PIN is a number that's typically four to six digits. It's used to identify you when using your debit card for ATM withdrawals or in-store purchases.Insufficient funds: If you write a check or attempt to spend more money than you have in your checking account, the transaction may be rejected for insufficient funds.Overdraft: An overdraft is the result of a transaction that causes your account to have a negative balance. The key difference between an overdraft and insufficient funds is that a transaction that results in an overdraft is approved, and a transaction resulting in insufficient funds is rejected. Overdrafts usually carry fees.Mobile or remote deposit: Most checking accounts allow customers to make check deposits from their smartphone or other mobile device by uploading a photo of the check, thereby saving a trip to the bank.Endorsement: To endorse a check means to sign the back of a check in the specified area, indicating that the person being paid is accepting the money.Routing number: There are three important numbers on every check, and the first is the routing number. This is a nine-digit code that corresponds with the bank that holds the checking account. Some major banks have several different routing numbers, depending on the geographical location where the account was opened.Account number: The account number identifies the specific deposit account within the bank indicated by the routing number. In order to send money to a checking account, you'll need both the routing and account number. In short, the routing number tells the sending institution which bank to send the money to, and the account number tells that bank where to put it.Check number: Although it's not particularly important when it comes to most transactions, every check has a unique number (usually three or four digits). Check numbers are useful for helping the account holder keep track of payments they make by check and can also help identify fraud in many cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Checking Account Interest Rates\n\n\n\n\nShow The List [+]\nHide The List [-]\n\n\n\n\n0.50% APY:\n\nSofi Checking and Savings\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nup to 3.30% APY:\n\nAxos Bank Rewards Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0% APY:\n\nDiscover Cashback Debit\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nup to 1.10% APY:\n\nQuontic High Interest Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n1.00% APY:\n\nAmerican Express Rewards Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0% APY:\n\nBetterment Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nUp to 0.25% APY:\n\nAlly Spending Account\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0.25% APY:\n\nAlliant High Rate Checking\n\n\n\n0.45% APY:\n\nSchwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0.10% APY:\n\nCapital One 360 Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n0.25% APY:\n\nEverBank Yield Pledge\u00ae Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\nUp to 0.15% APY:\n\nLendingClub Rewards Checking\n\n(Member FDIC.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Best Offers Available in\n\nAll States & Territories\n-----States------\n\nAlabama\n\n\nAlaska\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\nCalifornia\n\n\nColorado\n\n\nConnecticut\n\n\nWashington DC\n\n\nDelaware\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nHawaii\n\n\nIdaho\n\n\nIllinois\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nIowa\n\n\nKansas\n\n\nKentucky\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nMaine\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\nMassachusetts\n\n\nMichigan\n\n\nMinnesota\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\nMontana\n\n\nNebraska\n\n\nNevada\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\nNew Jersey\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\n\nNew York\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\nOhio\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOregon\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\n\nRhode Island\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n\nTennessee\n\n\nTexas\n\n\nUtah\n\n\nVermont\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\nWashington\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\nWisconsin\n\n\nWyoming\n\n-----Territories------\n\nAmerican Samoa\n\n\nFederated States of Micronesia\n\n\nGuam\n\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nPalau\n\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\n\n\n\n\nRatings Methodology\nRates as\nof Sep 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffer\nAPY\nMinimum to Earn APY\nNext Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSofi Checking and Savings\n\nMember FDIC.\n\n\nRating image, 4.75 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Checking accounts typically have no limits on the number of withdrawals or payments the owner can make, unlike savings accounts.\n\n\n\n\nAre online checking accounts safe?\n\n\n\nWell-established online banks are just as secure as traditional banks. They're FDIC insured as well, and they follow the same regulatory laws as any other bank. Not only are they required to put numerous security measures in place to protect your information, but they're also required to limit your liability as a consumer in cases of fraud.\n\n\n\n\nAre checking accounts free?\n\n\n\nChecking account costs vary dramatically. Some have multiple fees, such as maintenance charges, overdraft fees, and ATM fees, while others are entirely fee free.\n\n\n\n\nDo checking accounts earn interest?\n\n\n\nSome checking accounts, especially those offered by online banks, earn interest on deposits. But it's usually a small amount.\n\n\n\n\nDo checking accounts earn rewards?\n\n\n\nWhile some banks offer checking accounts with rewards, not all of them do. If earning rewards is important to you, make sure any bank or credit union you're considering offers this opportunity.\n\n\n\n\nHow do you earn a checking account bonus?\n\n\n\nRules vary based on the financial institution. Conditions for earning a bonus may include:Using a promotional codeMaking a minimum initial depositMaintaining a minimum balance for a specific amount of time","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Kailey Hagen\n and\u00a0Matt Frankel, CFP\u00ae\nOur Banking Experts","Article Date":"September 27, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"19":{"Article Title":"Best CD Rates of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/banks\/best-cd-rates\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

And don't tell your savings account, but CD rates are often competitive with the best savings account rates. If that sounds good to you, you're not alone -- we think CDs are cool, too.However, there is a trade-off: To get these great CD interest rates, you have to agree not to withdraw your money for a certain amount of time.

Here are some of the things to keep an eye out for:A high APY: This is how much you'll earn in interest.Daily compounding interest: Want more money in interest? Look for a high yield CD account with daily compounding.Low early withdrawal penalties: You'll pay a penalty to withdraw your funds ahead of schedule. The amount of this penalty should be outlined in a CD's fee schedule.Low or no fees: Fees with high yield CDs aren't common (except for early withdrawal penalties), but it's always good to check.How we decide which CDs to list on this pageYou're probably thinking, \"Wait a darn minute. How'd The Ascent decide which CDs to recommend?\"We'll tell you: The crew here only lists the CDs we'd recommend to family and friends. That means we just post the good stuff \u2013 big banks can't pay their way onto this page! Our litmus test: Would we recommend these CD rates to Grandma at her rock-your-socks-off birthday bonanza? You can bet on it.Follow these tips, and finding the best CD rates today should be a piece of cake.And now you may be hungry for more, so check out what industry experts think about CDs!\n\n\n\n\nTop CD questionsHow do CDs work?A CD is like a savings account, except you're not allowed to withdraw any money for a specific amount of time (anything from a few months to a few years).Are CDs safe?Yes, CDs are one of the safest investments you can make. These accounts are backed by FDIC insurance, so you won't lose money even if your bank goes under. (Note: If you withdraw your money early, you may pay a small fee.)Will CD rates go up in 2023?CD rates will likely continue to go up in 2023, but it's not guaranteed. If there are increases, expect them to be smaller than last year.\n\n\n\nOur Reviews: Best CD Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLendingClub CD\nBottom Line\nLendingClub CDs don't skimp on interest, offering competitive APYs for all six of their CD terms, from six months to five years. They're also FDIC insured. One downside is that you'll need to commit at least $2,500 to open an account.\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $2,500\n\n\n\nApply Now  for LendingClub CD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Mo.

LendingClub gives CD owners the ability to withdraw their earned interest at any point without penalty, which could be a big perk for those who want to rely on their CDs for income.One potential negative is LendingClub's $2,500 minimum initial deposit requirement. This can make LendingClub not the best option for beginners or people who want to create a CD ladder with their savings, but it can be an excellent choice for savers with relatively high balances who want to maximize their returns.Upon maturity, LendingClub CDs automatically renew. The bank sends a notice at least 30 days before the maturity date, and once the CD matures, account holders have a 10-day window to decide whether to add or remove money from the CD, or to let it renew for another term.LendingClub is best known for its personal and business loans, but you might be surprised to learn that it owns a banking subsidiary known as LendingClub Bank, which is a fully FDIC-insured financial institution. In addition to its CDs, LendingClub offers high-yield savings and rewards checking accounts. It has a user-friendly mobile banking app, and not only does LendingClub have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, but it has an average customer review of 4.56 out of 5 stars on the platform, one of the highest of any institution in our coverage universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Terms from 6 months to 5 yearsVery competitive APYs\n\n\n\n\nCons:Doesn't offer any non-standard maturity terms$2,500 minimum deposit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Alliance Bank\nBottom Line\nWestern Alliance offers some of the highest APYs we\u2019ve seen across short-term CDs, low $1 minimums, and relatively low withdrawal penalties without any additional fees. But you will need to look elsewhere for terms longer than one year.\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $1\n\n\n\nApply Now  for Western Alliance Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Mo. APY\n6 Mo. APY\n9 Mo. APY\n1 Yr.

For one thing, the bank offers some of the most competitive APYs we've seen, especially on shorter-term CDs. In fact, the bank's APYs on 9-month and 1-year CDs are among the best in the industry. Plus, the minimum deposit is just $1, so this can be a very beginner-friendly way to get started in CDs.However, Western Alliance Bank's term lengths are also one of the biggest potential negatives. It only offers four term lengths on Raisin, and its 1-year CD is the longest. You can open a 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, or 1-year CD with an excellent yield through Western Alliance Bank, but if you're looking to lock in a high APY for several years, you'll need to look elsewhere.Another potential negative is that Western Alliance Bank doesn't allow CD owners to withdraw their interest as it is paid. For example, many retired individuals will open a CD and withdraw the monthly interest payments to create an income stream, but this is not allowed with Western Alliance -- money must be left in the account until the maturity date or face a penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Very competitive APYsNo minimum deposit\n\n\n\n\nCons:Term lengths available online are one year or lessCannot withdraw interest until maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuontic CDs\nBottom Line\nQuontic Bank offers CDs with terms ranging from six months to five years. It offers most of the terms one would expect, though it is missing a four-year CD, so it may not be ideal for those hoping to build a CD ladder. Its rates are competitive, especially on its longer term CDs, and its minimum deposit is more affordable than what you see with some other top\u00a0banks.\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $500\n\n\n\nApply Now  for Quontic CDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Mo.

It has some of the best CD interest rates in the business, including a 5.30% APY on a 1-year CD, among the highest offered by any of the banks we follow. The bank's CDs have a $500 minimum opening deposit, so be sure to keep that in mind before opening an account.Quontic is an online-focused bank, with just a few branches for its mortgage business, but it is a safe and trustworthy financial institution. It is an FDIC-member bank, so you're covered up to $250,000 per depositor, and the bank has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau after almost 15 years in business.While the $500 minimum deposit might put it out of reach for some beginners, especially those who want to create CD ladders, it is generally a beginner-friendly institution. Quontic offers a beginner-friendly mobile banking app, and live support available by either phone or chat from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET.Finally, Quontic is a great choice for customers who want to keep all of their bank accounts in one place. In addition to its high-yield CDs, Quontic offers a great high-yield savings account, one of our top-rated money market accounts, plus two different online checking accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:High APYs on CDs\n\n\n\n\nCons:$500 minimum depositNo 4-year CD makes it difficult to build a CD ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover High Yield CD\nBottom Line\nDiscover has a higher minimum balance requirement than some of its competitors, but its rates are competitive and you don't have to worry about getting hit with any fees unless you withdraw funds via wire transfer or choose to withdraw from your CD before it reaches its maturity date. It also offers some unique term lengths, including CDs as short as three months and as long as 10 years.\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $2,500\n\n\n\nApply Now  for Discover High Yield CD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Mo.

It typically doesn't have the highest CD rates in the market, its rates are certainly competitive and it scores high marks in some categories, particularly customer service.Discover offers a wide range of CD term lengths, ranging from six months all the way to 10 years, which is a rarity in the industry. It offers competitive APYs, especially on longer-term CDs. On the downside, Discover has a relatively high $500 minimum deposit to open a new CD, so be sure to keep this in mind when you're shopping around.Discover also offers CDs in IRA (individual retirement account) form, allowing savers to put away money in a tax-advantaged manner. When your Discover CD expires, it will renew automatically, unless you choose to withdraw your funds.As an FDIC-insured bank, Discover's CDs are protected for as much as $250,000 per person in the unlikely event of a bank failure. However, Discover has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and has been in business for over six decades, so it is a very well-established and trusted bank. And although the relatively high minimum deposit might make it less accessible for some savers (not just beginners), Discover has excellent customer service and is available by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Competitive APYsTerms as long as 10 yearsLots of term options -- great for building a CD ladderOffers IRA CDs\n\n\n\n\nCons:$2,500 minimum deposit to open an account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarclays Online CD\nBottom Line\nBarclays offers competitive rates on most common CD terms with no minimum balance requirements. There are no monthly fees, so you likely won't lose money unless you try to withdraw your funds early. The only common CD term missing is a six-month CD -- in fact, there's no CD term less than one year, but those interested in building longer-term CD ladders will find plenty to like here.\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $0\n\n\n\nApply Now  for Barclays Online CD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Mo.

Most of Barclays' term lengths offer highly competitive APYs, with its 6-month CD the notable exception. Its longer-term CDs in particular have some of the best APYs on our best CDs list.Barclays primarily made our best CD list because it is one of the most beginner-friendly places to open a CD. Unlike most of its online competitors, Barclays has no minimum deposit requirement, so you can literally open a CD with just a few dollars. This also makes Barclay's one of the few places where you can create a CD ladder with a relatively small amount of money.Interest is paid monthly, and CD owners can choose to have their monthly interest deposited into a Barclays savings account or an account at another institution, or leave it in the account to compound. CDs will renew automatically at the end of the term, which has become the industry's standard practice, and customers have a 14-day grace period to decide to withdraw funds or change the maturity term of the CD.Barclays is one of the oldest continuously operating financial institutions in the world, with roots that trace back to 1690 in London, where the bank's headquarters are still located. It is a stable and trustworthy bank, and although it doesn't have physical branches in the United States, it's important to point out that Barclays is a massive institution in the U.K., and has a size that's on-par with some of the largest U.S. banks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:No minimums to openCompetitive APYs with most term lengths\n\n\n\n\nCons:6-month CDs have low APYCDs automatically renew unless the customer closes the account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynchrony Online CD\nBottom Line\nPerhaps one of the lesser-known names on the list, Synchrony is a full-line bank with a 90-year history.

The bank offers CDs in a wide range of terms from three months to five years and offers two unique products. Synchrony's 11-month no-penalty CD allows account holders to withdraw their money at any time without a penalty, and the 24-month Bump-Up CD allows for a one-time interest rate increase if the bank's APYs rise during the CD's term.There are no minimum deposit requirements, making Synchrony an ideal choice for beginners or for people who want to build a CD ladder without a ton of money. Its no-penalty CD can be a great choice for savers who think they won't need their money soon, but want to maintain flexibility. And the Bump-Up CD is a great choice for people who are worried that interest rates might continue to rise and don't want to miss out on extra income.Synchrony could also be a great choice for people who plan to rely on their CDs for income. Many banks don't allow any withdrawals from CDs (even interest payments), but Synchrony gives CD owners the option to withdraw the interest they receive, penalty-free, at any time during the CD term.Finally, Synchrony bank isn't exactly a household name, but you might have used some of its products without knowing it. The bank's primary business consists of cobranded store credit cards, and it partners with some of the largest retail brands to offer credit card products. In addition to its CDs, Synchrony offers high-yield savings and money market accounts, and all of its accounts are FDIC insured to $250,000 per person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Many different term lengthsCompetitive APYs, especially on 6-month and 12-month CDsUnique CD products availableNo minimum deposit\n\n\n\n\nCons:CDs automatically renew at maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCIT Bank CD\nBottom Line\nCIT is an online bank that offers very competitive rates on certain CD terms, including non-standard promotional terms.

It offers a few non-standard term lengths, such as 11-month and 13-month CDs, which could be a good fit for certain customers. CIT's CDs have a $1,000 minimum deposit requirement, so keep that in mind before opening one. However, the bank offers some unique CD products, such as a 11-month CD with no penalty for early withdrawals.Because of its minimum deposit requirement, CIT might not be the best choice for beginners, especially those who want to put money in several different term lengths to create a CD ladder. It offers highly rated customer service by phone from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m ET on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. There are also high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and checking accounts available, which makes CIT a smart choice for customers who want to keep all of their bank accounts in one place.You may not be familiar with CIT Bank, but it is a division of First Citizens Bank, which has more than 500 branches in 23 U.S. states. CIT has been in business for 115 years and its banking products are all FDIC insured. And it was named the number one bank in the nation for \"humanizing the customer service experience\" by American Banker out of more than 50 major financial institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Non-standard term lengths availableNo-penalty CD option with competitive APY\n\n\n\n\nCons:APYs not competitive for longer-term CDs$1,000 minimum deposit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs High Yield CD\nBottom Line\nSavers have the potential to create effective CD ladders through Marcus, as it provides competitive rates through the most common CD terms.

Marcus also offers penalty-free CDs for savers who don't want their money tied up.The bank's CDs require a $500 minimum deposit, which is on the lower end for banks with such a requirement, but could be an obstacle for beginners, especially those who wish to create a CD ladder. One unique feature is the ability to add more money to a Marcus high-yield CD for as long as 30 days after opening the account. Plus, account holders get a 10-day CD rate guarantee, which offers a nice layer of protection if you open an account and interest rates rise shortly after.Another big reason Marcus earned a spot on our best CDs list is that account holders have the option to withdraw any interest earned penalty-free at any time. This isn't offered by many banks, and can be a valuable feature for savers who might want to rely on their CDs for income to cover living expenses.As the name implies, Marcus is the consumer banking division of Goldman Sachs, which is one of the largest investment banks in the world and has been in business for more than 150 years. Marcus has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, and live customer service is available by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Highly competitive APYsMany term lengths availablePenalty-free option\n\n\n\n\nCons:$500 minimum deposit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBread Savings CD\nBottom Line\nComenity Direct CDs (the bank behind Bread Savings) are available in many of the most popular terms, making it a flexible high-yield CD to consider for differing needs.

Bread's CDs (formally known as the Bread Savings CDs) earn a spot on our list because they offer some of the most competitive APYs of any institution on our radar -- especially for one and two year term lengths -- but there are some potential drawbacks.Bread Savings CDs have a $1,500 minimum deposit, which may be a bit steep for some customers just getting started in the world of CDs, especially for those who want to use multiple maturity term lengths to form a CD ladder. Plus, there are no terms shorter than one year, which can be a dealbreaker for savers who are going to need their money within the next 12 months.Bread Financial might not be a familiar name, but that's because the name hasn't existed for very long. The business has been around since the early 1980s and was formerly known as Comenity Bank, which has been a leading issuer of private-label credit cards for some time. Bread Financial CDs are FDIC insured to a maximum of $250,000 per person, so you're protected in the unlikely event of bank failure.Like most banks. Bread Savings CDs automatically renew upon maturity unless you decide to withdraw your money or change the term. But unlike most other banks, Bread offers slightly higher renewal rates than it offers to new customers (think of it as a customer loyalty bonus).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Very competitive APYs\n\n\n\n\nCons:No terms shorter than 12 months$1,500 minimum deposit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlly High Yield CD\nBottom Line\nAlly High Yield CDs are notable for saver-friendly features like no minimum deposits and lower-than-average withdrawal penalties (though you're still better off holding through your CD term!).

For one thing, the bank offers highly competitive APYs, especially on its 9-month, 1-year, and 18-month CDs. Customers who choose to renew their CDs upon maturity get a 0.05% loyalty bonus added to the APY offered at the time of renewal. Plus, Ally CDs have no minimum deposit requirement, making them an excellent choice for beginners or savers who want to create a CD ladder with multiple term lengths.Ally also offers a couple of unique CD products, including its Raise Your Rate CD that comes in 2- and 4-year terms, and allows the customer to adjust their rate upward once (2-year) or twice (4-year) if Ally's rates increase. There's also a 11-month no-penalty CD that allows for withdrawals anytime after the first six days after account funding.Another reason Ally earns a spot on the list is for its highly rated mobile app that lets you open, view, and manage your CDs, as well as any other accounts you may have with Ally. Not all CDs offer mobile access (after all, the logic is that you shouldn't need to manage your account too often by nature).Ally Financial is an FDIC-member bank. It has existed in its current form since 2010, but was previously the financial subsidiary of General Motors, known as GMAC Financial at the time. Because of this, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Ally's primary business is auto lending, but in recent years it has been building its consumer deposit platform, including with its high-yield CDs. However, Ally also offers a full range of banking products and services, such as high-yield savings accounts, online checking accounts, investment accounts, and a variety of lending products. It can be a great choice for someone who wants to maximize the yield from their savings and wants to do all of their banking with the same institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Competitive APYs on most term lengthsNo minimum deposit requirementRewards upon renewal of CDsNo-penalty and rate-adjusting CD options\n\n\n\n\nCons:Renews automatically unless you cancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlliant CD\nBottom Line\nAlliant offers CD rates across common terms that stack up well with other banks on this list.

Alliant earned a spot on our list for its high APYs and top-notch customer ratings. You can also open share certificates with any term length from three to 48 months, in monthly increments, For example, if you want a 23-month CD, you can open one, and this flexibility is a big differentiator.Let's start with Alliant's CD APYs. The credit union's CDs have highly competitive APYs, and its 12-month and 18-month CD rates in particular are some of the highest among the banks we follow. Alliant's CDs also have a $1,000 minimum deposit requirement, which isn't the highest we know of but could be an obstacle for beginners or those trying to construct a CD ladder.. There are also Jumbo CDs available -- these have higher rates for certain terms with balances of $75,000 or higher.Unlike the other financial institutions on our best CDs list, Alliant is a member-owned credit union. It has been in business since 1935 and has over 600,000 customers in the United States. Credit unions are not covered by the FDIC, but are insured by the NCUA up to the same limit of $250,000 per person.In order to open an Alliant CD, you need to be (or become) a member of the credit union, which is generally a quick and easy process. Customer service representatives are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week by phone, and Alliant has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Highly competitive APYsDividend withdrawal optionMany unusual term lengthsJumbo CDs with higher APYs\n\n\n\n\nCons:No terms under 12 monthsMinimum deposit of $1,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital One 360 CD\nBottom Line\nBacked by Capital One's well-known brand, the Capital One 360 CDs offer competitive rates across many common terms, though they're stronger in durations of a year or longer.

It is an excellent combination of the yields savers typically expect from an online bank, and the convenience of branch-based banking.As mentioned, Capital One offers competitive CD yields, especially for a brick-and-mortar financial institution. It has terms ranging from six months to five years, and has a few non-standard lengths, such as 30-month CDs, in addition to all of the typical lengths. Capital One's 18-month CDs are especially competitive.Capital One CDs have no minimum balance requirements, and can be an excellent choice for beginners or for anyone who wants to create a CD ladder. Accounts are FDIC insured, and unlike some of the CDs on our list, you can choose to have interest paid to you as it is received or leave it in the account to compound.It's worth noting that if your primary goal is to maximize yield, you'll probably find higher APYs through some of the exclusively-online banks on the list. However, you might be surprised how comparable Capital One's yields are, and the convenience factor might make it worth giving up a bit of yield.Capital One is a bank best-known for its credit card business, but it is a full-service financial institution that has 750 branches in several states, including 30 \"cafe\" locations. So, not only could it be great for customers who might occasionally need to deposit cash or get in-person assistance, but Capital One CDs can also be a great choice for existing Capital One customers or those who are looking for an all-in-one banking relationship, as Capital One offers a full range of banking products and services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Competitive APYs, especially for branch-based banksNo minimum depositBranches and cafes are available\n\n\n\n\nCons:Higher yields are available through online banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Alliance Bank\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $500\n\n\n\n\nRead Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Mo.

Its APYs are generally competitive, but its most competitive yields are paid on terms of 36 months or less. If you're looking for a 4- or 5-year CD, you're likely to find a better rate elsewhere. However, the bank's APYs on shorter terms are highly competitive, especially for 24-month CDs, which are among the best on our radar.Prime Alliance CDs have $500 minimum deposits, which is in the middle of the pack. It can be prohibitive for people new to CDs or those who want to create a CD ladder of several different maturities. However, Prime Alliance could be a good option for people who want to use their CDs for income, as interest is paid quarterly and can be withdrawn as it is paid.Prime Alliance is a relatively small bank, but it offers some excellent products. In addition to its CDs, Prime Alliance has high-yield savings accounts, two different online checking accounts (including an interest-bearing option), as well as deposit products for business customers. It has one branch in Utah, but is mostly an online-focused bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Competitive APYsNo monthly fees\n\n\n\n\nCons:$500 minimum depositsAPYs are low for some terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are alternatives to CDs?CDs are appealing if you're trying to earn a high rate on your savings, but the fact that you cannot touch your money for a set amount of time can be too constraining for some people. If you don't think a high yield CD is a great fit for you, perhaps one of these accounts would work better.Savings accounts vs. CDsHigh-yield savings accounts accounts offer interest rates that are comparable to the highest CD rates. Plus, savings accounts have fewer restrictions on what you can do with your money. You're able to put money in, transfer it to a checking account, or withdraw it almost whenever you want (though withdrawals are often limited to six a month, per regulation D).Below are some examples of high-yield savings accounts.

What is a CD and what is it used for?A CD stands for a \u201ccertificate of deposit\u201d and are issued primarily by banks. They are financial instruments that pay either a fixed, variable or stepped up coupon. The most common CDs are those with a fixed coupon. The interest on a CD can be paid daily, monthly, quarterly or even annually. In the United States, CD\u2019s are nearly always insured by the FDIC which is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which is an agency of the federal government. CDs are used as an investment to offer security and a return of principal and the stated interest rate.How do you know if CD rates will go up?Nobody knows for certain if CD rates will increase. CD rates are determined by the bank or financial institution issuing the instrument and typically have a very tight correlation to the US bond market and the corresponding yield that is closest to the maturity of the CD. How does CD laddering work?CD laddering is the method of buying CD\u2019s with consistent, staggering maturities. For example, if you would like to invest $1mm in a CD ladder, you could invest $200k in a CD that matures in 1 yr, another $200k that matures in 2 years, a third $200k that matures in 3 years, etc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRita-Soledad Fern\u00e1ndez Paulino\n\nCEO of Wealth Para Todos\n\n\nRita-Soledad Fern\u00e1ndez Paulino is the founder and CEO of Wealth Para Todos, a financial coaching and education platform dedicated to removing barriers to financial security for marginalized communities. \n\nRead More\n\n\n\nWho is a CD right for?CDs are a great option for people who have already have at least 3 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account for an emergency fund, no debt with an interest rate above 9%, investment accounts funded for retirement, and who are saving for an upcoming expense that they don't plan to purchase for more than a year. People who meet this criteria will want to compare CD rates with HYSA rates and Series I Bond rates to ensure they get the highest interest rate possible. What is a CD and what is it used for?A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a type of savings account that requires you to keep your money in there for a certain period of time in exchange for a guaranteed rate of return. CDs are a great way to earn some extra cash while you sleep without having to worry about the value of your savings ever going down (like you may do when investing in the stock market.) Depending on the CD's interest rates, they could potentially protect your short-term savings from losing its purchasing power due to inflation.How do you know if CD rates will go up?CD rates are impacted by the federal funds rates. When the Federal Reserve expects banks to have more cash reserves, banks try to incentivize people to save more. Since federal chairman Jerome Powell has expressed another upcoming federal fund rate hike, we can probably expect for CD rates to increase a little more. How does CD laddering work?CD laddering consists of opening multiple CDs at different times in order to have access to your money at different times. Instead of taking a lump sum of money and opening one CD, you decide to split that lump sum into multiple CDs opened at different time periods or with different term lengths so you can have access to your money potentially sooner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD termThe CD's term is the length of time you agree to not touch your money. It can range from one month on the short end to six years or more on the long end. Most range from six months to five years. You'll usually find the longer the CD term, the higher the interest rate.Minimum depositWhile some of the highest CD rates have no minimum deposit, others may require a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Some jumbo CDs may have five-figure minimum deposit requirements.How interest is paid to youMost CDs add the interest you earn to your account balance, but some give you the option to have your interest paid directly to you. If you go this route, you can reap some of the benefits of your high yield CD immediately. But bear in mind that if you leave the money in your account instead, you can earn interest on your interest, which leads to more money overall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nWhat happens at the end of your CD term\n\nSome banks automatically enroll you in a new CD of the same term length unless you specify that you want to do something different. It's usually a bad idea to let your bank open a new CD for you. Watch out for this and make sure you tell your bank what you want to do with your money instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDIC or NCUA insuranceCD accounts offered by banks should carry FDIC insurance so your money is protected up to $250,000 per person per account. NCUA does the same thing for share certificates offered by credit unions. Most high yield CDs will have the appropriate insurance, but it pays to be sure.How often rates are raisedStep-up and bump-up CDs occasionally raise your rates. If you're interested in one of these, pay attention to how often you or the bank can increase the rate when you compare CD rates.Whether it's callableSome CDs are callable, which means the bank can call it back from you at some point and reissue you a new CD, possibly at a lower rate.\n\n\n\n\nWhich banks have the best CD rates?Online banks overwhelmingly offer the best CD interest rates when compared to larger brick-and-mortar traditional banks. In fact, some of our favorite online banks' current CD rates are multiples higher than what you'd find with a national bank.We've rarely seen a reason to invest in CDs with a brick-and-mortar national bank, especially when online banks offer the same FDIC insurance protection. CD interest rates at online banks tend to be higher.If looking to compare CD rates, we suggest reviewing some of the current rates on CDs at the following financial institutions:Discover CD ratesCapital One 360 CD ratesAlly CD ratesMarcus by Goldman Sachs CD rates\n\n\n\n\nWhen is a CD a good idea?Fixed-rate CDs are the most popular offerings, and bump-up CDs are worth considering as well. If you're considering opening a CD, here's a scenario-based analysis of when it may be the right time to open one of these CD accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of CD\n\n\nWhen Opening One Is a Good Idea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed-rate CD\n\n\nWhen market interest rates are decreasing: This is particularly smart for longer terms, so that you can lock in a high rate. If you wait, interest rates may drop by the time you open a CD.\n\n\n\n\nBump-up CD\n\n\nWhen rates are increasing: Opening a bump-up CD when rates are going up could be a good idea since you can request a rate increase later, so long as the bank offers a higher rate for the same term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll notice it's especially important to keep an eye on current rates on cds in order to know when the right time is to open a CD account.RELATED: What Is CD Laddering? CD laddering can help you optimize your interest earnings. Head to our guide to see if this is the right strategy for your portfolio.\n\n\n\n\nWhen is a CD a bad idea?It's best to wait to take action on opening a fixed-rate CD when interest rates are increasing. Waiting allows you to snag the best CD rates and helps you avoid locking in a low rate.Bump-up CDs have more flexibility, but they can still be the wrong choice if rates are rising rapidly because you can usually only request a rate increase once per term and might miss out on better rates later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of CD\n\n\nWhen Opening a CD Is a Bad Idea\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed-rate CD\n\n\nWhen market interest rates are increasing: You risk locking yourself into a low rate for an extended period of time, especially for longer-term CDs.\n\n\n\n\nBump-up CD\n\n\nWhen rates are increasing rapidly: This may be a bad idea. You could open a bump-up CD and request a rate increase later, assuming the bank offers a higher rate on the same term, but it may be best to put your money into a high-yield savings account and invest in a CD later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a CD?A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of FDIC-insured deposit account offered by many banks and credit unions that usually has a fixed interest rate over a certain number of months or years. CD interest rates are often higher than what you find with most savings accounts, but they carry the stipulation that you must not touch the money until the CD term is over. If you withdraw the funds early, you pay a penalty, though some banks allow a CD loan (a loan secured by the money you already have in your CD).How does a CD work?You deposit a certain amount of money into a high-yield CD and agree not to touch it for the length of the CD term in exchange for a high rate of interest that's usually locked in for the full term. Your bank pays that interest monthly or quarterly, and when the CD term is up, you may withdraw the funds and spend them, place them in a savings account, or put them in another high-interest CD.\u00a0Withdrawing your funds before the CD term ends results in a penalty -- usually several months' worth of interest. The earlier you withdraw the funds, the larger your penalty will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre CD rates fixed?\n\nCD banking rates are usually locked in at the time you open the account, but it depends on the type of CD you have. Bump-up CDs enable you to raise your rates over time, while callable CDs carry the risk that your rates could drop. This can hurt your profits, so you need to be especially careful before you sign up for one of these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther CD term lengths to considerCDs are a flexible savings option in that the terms range from months up to 10 years, making them valuable for depositors with an array of short- and long-term needs. Here are the most common CD terms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest 6-month CD ratesBest 1-year CD rates18-month CD rates2-year CD rates\n\n\n\n\nBest 3-year CD ratesBest 4-year CD ratesBest 5-year CD rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nCan you use a CD for an emergency fund?\n\n\n\nUsing a CD for an emergency fund is safer than putting it in the stock market. However, it's not as flexible as a savings account. If you withdraw money from a CD before the term is over, you will have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. Typically it is one to two months of interest earned.Other options for an emergency fund are a savings account, high-yield account, money market account, or a money market mutual fund.\n\n\n\n\nHow much will a $10,000 CD make in a year?\n\n\n\nIf you invest $10,000 in a 1-year CD at a 1.00% APY, it would make about $100. The amount earned depends on the CD rate. To calculate this yourself, multiply the amount you plan to deposit by the APY that the CD offers.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a good CD rate?\n\n\n\nA good CD rate in 2023 is 4.00% or higher. Many of the best CDs offer an APY of 4.00% or more on 1-year CDs. Rates like these are much higher than the national average, and you can normally only find them at online banks.\n\n\n\n\nAre CDs safe?\n\n\n\nYes. CD deposits are covered by FDIC insurance, which insures depositors for up to $250,000 per person per bank. In the event of a bank's insolvency, this insurance would kick in and cover any lost funds up to that amount.\n\n\n\n\nAre CD rates adjustable or fixed?\n\n\n\nYour CD rate is typically fixed for the term of the CD, unlike savings accounts, where your rate will adjust over time. Specialty CDs like bump-ups have rates that can adjust during the CD term.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Kailey Hagen\n and\u00a0Matt Frankel, CFP\u00ae\nOur Banking Experts","Article Date":"September 28, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"20":{"Article Title":"Best Personal Loans of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/personal-loans\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Your APR may be as low as 11.49% or as high as 19.49% for the term of your loan. The lowest rate quoted assumes excellent credit, and a loan term of 36 months or shorter. Otherwise, a higher rate will apply. For example, if you borrow $10,000 for 36 months at 15.99% APR, to repay your loan you will have to make 36 monthly payments of approximately $351.52.There is a 0.5% APR discount if you enroll in automatic payments at loan origination. Additionally, existing Citigold and Citi Priority customers will receive a 0.25% discount to the interest rate. If you are in default, your APR may increase by 2.00%. No down payment is required. Rates subject to change without notice.You must be at least 18 years of age (21 years of age in Puerto Rico). Co-applicants are not permitted. Loan proceeds cannot be used for post-secondary educational or business purposes.If you apply online, you must agree to receive the loan note and all other account disclosures provided at loan origination in an electronic format and provide your signature electronically.Credit cards issued by Citibank, N.A. or its affiliates, as well as Checking Plus and Ready Credit accounts, are not eligible for debt consolidation, and Citibank will not issue payoff checks for these accounts. If you are unsure of the issuer on the account, please visit https:\/\/www.citi.com\/affiliatesproducts for a list of Citi products and affiliates.\n\n\n*Upstart Loan DisclaimerThe full range of available rates varies by state. The average 3-year loan offered across all lenders using the Upstart platform will have an APR of 21.97% and 36 monthly payments of $35 per $1,000 borrowed. For example, the total cost of a $10,000 loan would be $12,646 including a $626 origination fee. APR is calculated based on 3-year rates offered in the last 1 month. There is no down payment and no prepayment penalty. Your APR will be determined based on your credit, income, and certain other information provided in your loan application.\n\n\n*SoFi Personal Loan DisclaimerFixed\u00a0rates\u00a0from 8.99% APR to 25.81% APR reflect the 0.25% autopay interest\u00a0rate\u00a0discount and a 0.25% direct deposit interest\u00a0rate\u00a0discount. SoFi\u00a0rate\u00a0ranges are current as of 05\/19\/23 and are subject to change without notice. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest\u00a0rate. Lowest\u00a0rates\u00a0reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Your actual\u00a0rate\u00a0will be within the range of\u00a0rates\u00a0listed and will depend on the term you select, evaluation of your creditworthiness, income, and a variety of other factors.Loan\u00a0amounts range from $5,000\u2013 $100,000. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly\u00a0rate\u00a0and reflects both your interest\u00a0rate\u00a0and an origination fee of 0%-6%, which will be deducted from any\u00a0loan\u00a0proceeds you receive.Autopay: The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest\u00a0rate\u00a0reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account.\u00a0Autopay is not required to receive a\u00a0loan\u00a0from SoFi.The following payment example depicts the APR, monthly payment and total payments made during the life of a personal loan with a single disbursement. All loan rates below are shown with the autopay discount (0.25%) and direct deposit discount (0.25%). The monthly payment for a\u00a0$30,000\u00a0loan with a 60-month term and a fixed\u00a0annual percentage rate (APR) between 12.95% \u2013 25.03%\u00a0would be\u00a0$681.82 \u2013 $881.07\u00a0in monthly payments, with total payments between\u00a0$40,909.47\u00a0 \u2013 $52,864.05. Your actual interest rate may be different than the loan interest rates in these examples and will be based on term of loan, your financial history, and other factors, including your cosigner\u2019s (if any) financial history. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. See SoFi.com\/eligibilityfor details.Direct Deposit Discount: To be eligible to potentially receive an additional (0.25%) interest\u00a0rate\u00a0reduction for setting up direct deposit with a SoFi Checking and Savings account offered by SoFi Bank, N.A. or eligible cash management account offered by SoFi Securities, LLC (\u201cDirect Deposit Account\u201d), you must have an open Direct Deposit Account within 30 days of the funding of your\u00a0Loan. Once eligible, you will receive this discount during periods in which you have enabled payroll direct deposits of at least $1,000\/month to a Direct Deposit Account in accordance with SoFi\u2019s reasonable procedures and requirements to be determined at SoFi\u2019s sole discretion. This discount will be lost during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off direct deposits to your Direct Deposit Account.\u00a0You are not required to enroll in direct deposits to receive a\u00a0Loan.\n\n\nRates quoted are with AutoPay. Your loan terms are not guaranteed and may vary based on loan purpose, length of loan, loan amount, credit history and payment method (AutoPay or Invoice). AutoPay discount is only available when selected prior to loan funding. Rates without AutoPay are 0.50% points higher. To obtain a loan, you must complete an application on LightStream.com which may affect your credit score. You may be required to verify income, identity and other stated application information. Payment example: Monthly payments for a $10,000 loan at 8.49% APR with a term of 5 years would result in 60 monthly payments of $205.12. \u00a0Some additional conditions and limitations apply.

As a finance expert, I have developed a deep understanding of the intricacies of personal loans -- the good and not-so-good. I believe everyone deserves access to fair and transparent financial products and strive to provide readers with the accurate information they need to make an informed choice. -Dana George, writer for The Ascent, a Motley Fool service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a deeper dive into our personal loan reviews\n\n\n\nCiti Personal Loan ReviewCiti offers loans as small as $2,000, making it a convenient option for a borrower who only needs enough to get by and does not want to carry the debt for long. With a narrow range of interest rates, borrowers don't have to worry about being hit with a sky-high rate. However, with a loan term of up to 60 months, this could be an ideal loan for a person looking to consolidate existing debt.Citi personal loan requirementsCredit score of 750 or moreMinimum annual income of $30,000Age 18 or older (21 or older in Puerto Rico)Social Security numberVerifiable bank accountU.S. citizen or permanent resident\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Citi personal loans different?\n\nCiti stands out from the crowd by capping its current interest rates at under 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoFi Loan ReviewSoFi offers loans from $5,000 - $100,000, with terms from 24 - 84 months. The lender offers flexible repayment options and unemployment protection. Once the borrower signs the loan papers, the payment can hit their bank account as early as the next day. SoFi is a particularly good option for borrowers who want to use the funds to pay off high-interest credit cards. In fact, SoFi will pay the credit card issuers directly, then reward the borrower with a rate discount for allowing direct pay. The minimum credit score required is 680.SoFi personal loan requirementsHave a credit score of at least 680Be 18 years of age or olderBe employed or provide evidence of imminent employmentIf not employed, have a reliable source of incomeBe a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or non-permanent resident\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes SoFi personal loans different?\n\nSoFi is one of a handful of lenders that will pay off high-interest credit cards directly on behalf of the customer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpstart Personal Loan ReviewUpstart provides personal loans to borrowers with credit scores as low as 300 in most states, and it's one of the few lenders that will consider a score that low. Loans of $1,000 - $50,000 are available, although Upstart does tack on an origination fee of 0% - 12%. Borrowers can choose terms of 36 or 60 months, and may receive their money one business day after signing.Upstart lending requirementsBe 18 years of age or olderHave a valid Social Security numberHave an active bank accountHave an annual income of at least $12,000Be a U.S. citizen or permanent residentNot be a resident of Iowa or West Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Upstart lending different?\n\nWithout a doubt, the thing that sets Upstart apart from its competitors is its willingness to entertain loan applications with credit scores as low as 300.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightstream Loan ReviewLightStream personal loans are available from $5,000 - $100,000, with no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Applicants need a score of Good credit or greater, but LightStream does allow co-applicants. Loan terms range from 24-144 months (varies by loan purpose). If an applicant has been approved for a personal loan with the same terms by another lender, LightStream will beat that lender's rate by 0.1%.Lightstream lending requirementsHave a valid Social Security numberHave a clear plan for what you want to do with the borrowed fundsBe able to provide evidence of any available assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes LightStream loans different?\n\nThe LightStream loan is far less expensive to get into than most loans. That's because there are no origination fees. Another thing that sets LightStream apart is that it allows you to bring a co-applicant who may have a higher credit score or more substantial credit history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy Money Loan ReviewHappy Money is designed for those who want to pay off high-interest credit cards. What sets Happy Money apart is the focus it puts on those who hope to build their credit scores and learn more about their own financial behavior. The lender offers a free six-week email course called \"Peace,\" intended to help customers deal with financial stress in a positive way. Loans are available from $5,000 - $40,000 in all states except Massachusetts and Nevada, and come with terms of 24 - 60 months. There is an origination fee ranging from 0% - 5%.Happy Money loan requirementsBe 18 years of age or olderHave a valid Social Security numberHave an active checking accountNot live in Massachusetts or NevadaHave a credit score of 640 or higherHave no current account delinquencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Happy Money Unique?\n\nHappy Money is unique among lenders due to programs like Peace, as well as a personality and stress assessment. Rather than simply loan money, Happy Money seeks to educate borrowers and leave them with greater financial confidence. However, Happy Money's current lowest rate is higher than that of many other lenders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvant Lending ReviewAvant accepts applicants with credit scores as low as 580, significantly lower than the national average. That's the good news. The not-so-good news is that applicants may pay a high interest rate and a loan origination fee of 0% - 4.75%. Plus, Avant charges a late fee of $25 and a returned check fee of $15.Avant lending requirementsHave a monthly income of at least $1,200 (can include alimony, child support, or other maintenance)Have a credit history that includes at least one accountBe able to apply on their own (no joint applications or co-signers are accepted)Live in any state except for Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, New York, Vermont, or West Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Avant lending different?\n\nAvant is one of the few credible lenders willing to loan money to those with poor credit scores. Loan amounts range from $2,000 - $35,000, making it possible to borrow a relatively small amount of money and pay it back quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAchieve Personal Loan ReviewFormerly known as FreedomPlus, Achieve requires applicants to have a minimum credit score of 620. Customers can borrow between $5,000 - $50,000. Terms stretch from 24 - 60 months. Borrowers can also count on paying an origination fee of 0% - 4.99%. The low end of the interest rate is not out of line with other lenders, particularly for borrowers with good rather than excellent credit.Achieve loan requirementsMust be 18 years of age or older in most states; must be at least 19 in Alabama or NebraskaMust be a U.S. citizen or permanent residentMust have a Social Security numberMust provide proof of incomeMust have a verified bank account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Achieve loans different?\n\nAchieve gives applicants with a fair credit score another option to consider. The rates are not the lowest and the fees can be costly, but it's an option that may allow a person to cover the cost of replacing their transmission or repairing tree damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Egg Loan ReviewBest Egg borrowers can apply for $2,000 to $50,000. However, the loan will not be cheap. In addition, the only applicants offered the lowest rate must have a FICO\u00ae Score of at least 700 and earn a minimum of $100,000 annually. The high end of the rate will be prohibitively expensive for many borrowers. Best Egg also charges an origination fee of 0.99% - 8.99%, another factor that can make its loans expensive. Loan terms range from 36 - 60 months.Best Egg lending requirementsMust have a minimum credit score of 550Proof of income is requiredMust have a U.S. addressMust have a valid Social Security numberDebt-to-income (DTI) ratio (including mortgage) must be 65% or lessMust live in any U.S. state except: Iowa, Vermont, West Virginia, or U.S. territories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Best Egg personal loans different?\n\nOne bright spot for Best Egg is the fact that loan proceeds are often in the borrower's bank account as soon as the following day. Not all lenders can say the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover Personal Loan ReviewThe Discover Personal Loan is available in all 50 states plus Puerto Rico. Loan amounts range from $2,500 - $40,000. While $40,000 may not be enough to complete a remodeling project, it should be more than enough to cover a 50th-anniversary party, wedding, or emergency situation. Discover charges no origination fee, saving borrowers money upfront. Currently, terms range from 36 - 84 months.Discover loan lending requirementsMinimum credit score of 660 is requiredApplicant must earn at least $25,000 annuallyMust be 18 years of age or olderMust be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Discover personal loans different?\n\nOne thing that sets the Discover Personal Loan apart is its 30-day guarantee. If a borrower experiences a change in circumstances or even a change in heart, they have up to 30 days to refund the loan in full without paying any interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for with the best personal loansThe lower the interest rate, the more money you save in paying back the loan. A great loan is one carrying a low interest rate. The interest on a loan is calculated as a percent of the total you borrow.Look for your personal loan term sweet spot, the shortest term with the most affordable payment. The best loans fit your budget and timeline. The \"loan term\" is the period of time you have to repay a loan in full. Some people opt for a longer loan term because it keeps their monthly payments low. However, the longer you carry a loan, the more interest you pay in total.The best personal loan lenders don't charge an origination fee. Other expenses -- like prepayment and late fees -- are kept to a minimum. Another key trait of a great personal loan is that it has no fees or very low fees. Fees can be sneaky. Say a lender offers you a low interest personal loan, but piles on fees. That loan may end up costing more than a loan with a slightly higher interest rate but no fees.\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the best personal loan ratesTo get the best rates from loan companies, follow these three steps:Maintain a high credit score. A FICO\u00ae Score of at least 720 is normally enough to qualify for the lowest personal loan interest rates.Get a cosigner. If your credit score is not high enough to qualify for a good interest rate, a personal loan cosigner with an excellent credit score can help you get a better interest rate.Shop around for the best rate. Consider looking at traditional banks, credit unions, or even online personal loans. Do your research to find a lender that is offering the best personal loan rates. Many have an online prequalification tool that will give you a rate without hurting your credit score. In some cases, lenders will offer promotions and limited-time discounts.\n\n\n\n\nWhen is a personal loan the best option?If you know how you're going to spend the money and have a plan to repay it, a personal loan can be a good tool for accomplishing your goals. Most lenders don't care how you spend the money, as long as you pay it back as promised.If you need the money quickly, make sure to check the lender's approval and funding timeline. Many lenders offer next day funding, and some even offer funding as quickly as the same day you're approved. The best loans like these can help you overcome financial roadblocks, even when you need cash fast.\n\n\n\n\nDo interest rates matter?Let's compare personal loan rates. Say you need to borrow $20,000 to replace the roof of your house, and you plan to get a loan with a five-year term. You're considering two options: Lender A and Lender B. Below, we've summarized these two imaginary lenders and how their interest rates would impact the cost of your loan.Even a small percentage change can result in significant savings. It's clear that the lender offering the lower interest rate can save you money over the life of the loan. These are funds you can use in some other way, like investing for your future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLender AInterest rate: 5.5%Monthly payment: $382Total interest paid over the life of the loan: $2,921\n\n\n\n\nLender BInterest rate: 6.9%Monthly payment: $395Total interest paid over the life of the loan: $3,705\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may only pay an extra $13 per month for a loan from Lender B, but that small difference costs you $780 more over the life of the loan. For help finding low interest personal loans, check out our guide to good interest rates for personal loans.What if I have bad credit?You will likely pay a higher interest rate for a personal loan. If this is your situation, you have two options: You can take steps to raise your score and wait until it's in better shape before applying for a loan. The second option is to get a loan now, then refinance your personal loan later (when your credit score is higher and you can get a better rate).\n\n\n\n\nWhat should personal loans be used for?While personal loans can be used for anything, the key is to use them to improve your financial well-being. Here are some of the best reasons to get a personal loan:Debt consolidation: Credit cards generally have higher interest rates. A personal loan can be used to consolidate your higher-interest debt to a lower-interest loan.Home renovations: Certain home renovations can increase the value of your home. If you have equity in your home, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a better financing option.Career advancement: Paying for professional certifications, education, and training can boost your career prospects and opportunities for promotion or a higher-paying job.Unexpected expenses: People should have an emergency savings account that has three to six months of expenses. If you don't, a personal loan can help cover a family emergency or help you recover from unexpected and expensive inconveniences.\n\n\n\n\nWhat should personal loans not be used for?Personal loans have higher interest rates than secured loans and if not used properly, can just increase your debt payments. It may be better to cut expenses or find additional ways to increase your income rather than take out a personal loan. Here are some expenses you should not use a personal loan for.Extravagant vacations: A short-term trip can lead to long-term consequences. A personal loan should not be used to fund an elaborate vacation if the loan can't be paid back.Celebrations (weddings\/birthdays\/graduations): If you can't afford to pay the loan back, you shouldn't get a personal loan for events that only last a day. Celebrations generally are planned in advance, so it is better to save up for it.Extra spending money: Taking out a personal loan to raise your standard of living is not a good idea. You should avoid a lifestyle your current finances can't support.\n\n\n\n\nHow to get a personal loanNo matter where you apply to get a personal loan -- a bank, credit union, or an online personal loan lender -- the application process is the same.Here are the steps to take.Gather documentsNo matter where you apply, the lender is likely to ask for the same documents. Getting them together before you apply can streamline the process and save you a great deal of stress. Here's what you need:Proof of identificationProof of addressList of monthly expensesEvidence of how much your collateral is worth (if you're applying for a secured personal loan)Whether it's a secured personal loan or an unsecured personal loan, the lender may ask about the purpose for the funds. Some personal loans are designated for specific purposes, like those to help consolidate existing debt, but those loan types are relatively uncommon.Shop lendersTake the time to shop for the best lender. Lenders make loan decisions based on a \"soft\" credit check, which has no impact on your credit score. This soft credit check gives the personal loan lender a sense of your credit history, including credit card debt and other debt (like an outstanding installment loan). If your credit score is not quite perfect, look for lenders that specialize in personal loans for fair credit or personal loans for bad credit.Don't leave any gaps -- fill out the entire loan application and provide the lender with all documents requested. If you do this, it should not take long to hear whether your loan has been approved. Some of the best lenders let you know within minutes if your application has been approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrequalifying for a personal loan\n\nPersonal loan prequalification or pre-approval allows you to get a sense of what loan terms are available. Most prequalification processes use a soft credit check, which doesn't impact your credit score. If you qualify, lenders will let you know how much you can borrow, the interest rate you will be charged, and how long you'll have to repay the loan. You can use this information to compare personal loans. If you do not qualify, you can learn what you need to do to improve your odds of getting a personal loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare loan offersCompare loans of the same type side by side. If you have applied for unsecured loans, compare them only to other unsecured loan offers. And if you've applied for secured loans, compare them only to other secured loan offers.Here's what to look for:The lowest annual percentage rateA repayment term that fits your budgetLoan amounts that match your borrowing needsLowest loan fees (ideally, you'll find a loan with no origination fee or prepayment penalty)Perks like loan deferment when you're unemployedCommit to a lenderA lender does not run a \"hard\" credit check until you let them know you want to proceed with a loan. So if you applied with five banks, only the bank you choose to work with runs a hard credit check.A hard credit check is a deeper dive into your credit history, and it helps the personal loan provider make sure a borrower meets its minimum credit score requirement and has paid bills on time. Although the hard credit check may decrease your credit score, it's typically by less than five points. After a few months of regular payments, your score should rebound to its pre-loan level.Note: If a low credit score means you don't receive a loan offer that works for you, consider taking time to improve your credit score. Boosting your score can only help you in the long run. Small changes like reducing your credit utilization, paying bills on time, and only applying for credit when needed can help raise your FICO\u00ae Score.Sign loan documentsWhether you're working with an online lender or a brick-and-mortar financial institution, most lenders allow you to sign documents electronically. Read through the documents thoroughly before signing. Once you've signed, you're legally committed to whatever is written inside the four corners of the contract.Wait for loan fundingFunds usually hit your bank account one to 14 days from the time of loan approval. If you need the money quickly, ask lenders about their fund distribution times as you shop for the loan. If you can't wait, make sure to work only with a lender that promises a quick distribution of funds.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if your personal loan application is not approved?If your personal loan request is denied, the first step is to find out the reason. Typically, you will be denied if your credit score does not meet the minimum qualifications.You may have negative items on your credit report, not enough credit history, or high credit card balances. Another reason may be that your income doesn't meet the minimum requirements or your debt-to-income ratio is too high. There are other factors that could impact loan approval, such as your employment history, cash flow history, and available assets.If you are denied, work on improving your credit history and credit score. Making on-time payments makes up the biggest piece of your credit score. Keep your credit card balances and utilization low. Pay down your credit card debt and ask your credit card company to raise your limits to help with your utilization.Avoiding too many hard inquiries can also improve your credit. After you have increased your credit score, you will be in a better position to qualify for a personal loan.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the alternatives to personal loans? Loans are not for everyone. Depending on your circumstances -- for example, if you need money to fund a project or pay an unexpected expense -- you may want to look at other options.Here are two alternatives to personal loans.Credit cardsA credit card can provide fast cash in an urgent situation. If you qualify for a 0% APR credit card, you have time (typically 12 to 18 months) to pay off the debt with no interest.Only use a credit card with a 0% transfer offer if you're confident you can pay it off in full before the promotional rate expires. At the end of the promotional period, the interest rate shoots up to its standard rate, and you could get stuck trying to pay down debt as high interest piles on top.Secured line of creditA secured line of credit can help you snag the best rates for personal loans. When you take out a secured line of credit or secured personal loan, you typically pay a lower interest rate because you put up something of value as collateral. This may be anything of value, such as a car, home, boat, or jewelry.A line of credit offers greater flexibility. You can borrow up to your credit limit, depending on what you need, and you only pay interest on the amount you borrow.Online personal loan companies rarely offer secured lines of credit, so if that's the route you choose, plan on working with a brick-and-mortar bank or credit union.\n\n\n\n\nHow to pay off your personal loanSince personal loans typically have higher interest rates, you want to pay them off as fast as you can. You will pay less interest and have more peace of mind if you don't have potentially tens of thousands of dollars to pay back. Here are some simple tips to help you pay back your personal loan faster without breaking the bank. Make sure you check with your lender to see if there are any penalties for paying off your personal loan early.Make bi-weekly payments. Most loans require you to make monthly payments. Instead, make a half-payment every two weeks. By doing this, your payments will be applied to the principal more often, so you end up paying less interest over time. Also, by making payments on your personal loan every two weeks, you will be making 26 total payments per year. This translates to one whole extra payment a year. This can shorten your loan payoff by months and in some cases years.Make an extra payment. If your lender will not allow you to split your loan payments, make an extra payment every year. Use a bonus, tax refund, or additional income for the extra payment. If the amount is too much to pay it at once, divide it by 12 and add it to your monthly payment to spread it out over time. The more money you are able to pay toward the loan, the faster you can pay it off. Consider getting a side hustle, selling things you don't need, or cutting your expenses to put extra money toward the loan.Round up your monthly payment. Round up your loan to the nearest $50 dollars. For example, if your loan payment is $230, round up to $250. For an even bigger impact, you could round up to the nearest $100. In this case, it would be $300. The extra amount may be small enough to not impact your budget, but it would help you pay down your personal loan sooner.Refinance your loan. If you have a high interest rate on your loan, look to refinance to get a better rate. Your credit score may have improved since you got the loan. Shop around to find the best rates.\n\n\n\n\nOther personal loans to compareIf you look through our loan suggestions but don't find a loan that fits your needs, don't worry. No loan fits every borrower or every set of circumstances. Here are a few others to consider:LendingPoint: Good for people with low credit scoresUpgrade: Good for debt consolidation and people with fair creditWells Fargo Personal Loans: Good for low APRs for Wells Fargo customersTaking out a personal loan is a big deal. You're committing to years of working with a specific financial institution and taking on new debt. Take your time to decide if you can comfortably afford a personal loan. If you decide you can, take time to find the loan that's just right for you.\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nHow long does it take to pay back a personal loan?\n\n\n\nWhile the loan term may run anywhere from one to 10 years, a term of three to five years is more common. That said, if you opt for a personal loan with no prepayment penalty, you can pay it off before the term ends. Doing so minimizes the amount you pay in interest.\n\n\n\n\nAre personal loans better than credit cards?\n\n\n\nPersonal loans normally carry a lower interest rate than credit cards do, and in that way, personal loans are a better option. Another advantage of personal loans is that, unlike credit cards, they don't affect your credit utilization ratio, which you want to be as low as possible. That's why taking out a personal loan to pay off credit card debt often helps your credit score. But personal loans and credit cards both represent debt, and the best financial move is to pay either off as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\nHow many personal loans can you have?\n\n\n\nThere is no limit on how many loans you can have from different loan lenders. Some lenders may limit the number of personal loans you can have. Loan companies will consider your debt-to-income ratio, credit score, as well as other factors when determining how many loans you can take out or how much you qualify for. If you have too many loans, then it can impact your credit score, making it more difficult to qualify for new credit or a better rate.\n\n\n\n\nHow are unsecured personal loan rates different from secured loan rates?\n\n\n\nUnsecured personal loan rates generally have higher interest rates than secured loans do. The lender requires nothing more than good credit and your written promise to repay the loan as agreed. Compared to a mortgage or auto loan, personal loan lenders take more risk since there is no collateral to back up the loan in case of a default.\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of interest rates do personal loans have?\n\n\n\nPersonal loans have a fixed interest rate based on the creditworthiness of the individual applying for the loan. The higher your credit score, the lower you can expect the lender's interest rate to be. Even if your credit score is not as high as you would like, you may still qualify for a personal loan with bad credit. However, you'll likely pay a higher interest rate than other borrowers.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Dana George\n and\u00a0Robin Hartill, CFP\nOur Loans Experts","Article Date":"September 27, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"21":{"Article Title":"Best Debt Consolidation Loans of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/personal-loans\/best-personal-loans-debt-consolidation\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

All personal loans have a 1.85% to 9.99% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.59% APR (which includes a 13.94% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $341.48. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,293.46. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early.\u00a0Personal loans issued by Upgrade's bank partners.

Let's say you have a bunch of little charges, spread across several credit cards (darn you, Starbucks!). Upgrade provides personal loans as small as $1,000. If the idea of debt that minor sounds like bliss because high-interest credit has you by the neck, loans up to $50,000 are available to qualified applicants.Once approved and papers have been signed, the funds will hit a borrower's bank account within four days (often sooner). Terms stretch from two to seven years, allowing you more control over the monthly payment. However, no cosigners are allowed, which is a bummer if your credit score has taken a nosedive. Plus, if your credit score is on the low end, origination fees up to 9.99% can be costly. Once an application is made, Upgrade conducts a soft credit check, which means your credit score won't get dinged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Upgrade debt consolidation loans different?\n\nUpgrade offers one of the longest repayment terms in the personal loan business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade debt consolidation loan requirements\n\n\n\nHave a credit score of at least 580Be 18 or 19 years of age, depending on the state in which the applicant livesBe a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or hold an immigration visaHave a Social Security number of passportProvide evidence of U.S. bank account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightStream debt consolidation loansIn debt but still rocking a (fairly) healthy credit score? LightStream personal loans are available from $5,000 to $100,000, with no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Loan terms ranging from 24 to 48 months allow you to control your monthly payment to some degree. Although you'll need a credit score of 660 or greater, LightStream does allow co-applicants (yes!). If you've been approved for a personal loan by another lender, LightStream will beat that lender's rate by 0.1%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Lightstream debt consolidation loans different?\n\nBecause there are no origination fees, LightStream loans cost less than most loans. One thing that sets LightStream apart is that it allows an applicant to bring a co-applicant who may have a higher credit score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightstream debt consolidation loan requirements\n\n\n\nHave a valid Social Security numberHave a clear plan for what you want to do with the borrowed fundsBe able to provide evidence of any available assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoFi Personal Loans debt consolidation loansSoFi requires a good credit score of 680 or higher. However, if you qualify, the lender offers some pretty attractive benefits, including loan amounts from $5,000 to $100,000. You can also bring a co-borrower if you don't qualify on your own. In addition to same-day funding, SoFi offers unemployment protection if you lose your job and making loan payments is off the table for a while. The lender also considers alternative sources to determine creditworthiness for borrowers who haven't had time to build a long credit history. Unlike many lenders, SoFi charges no origination fee or prepayment penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes SoFi debt consolidation loans different?\n\nSoFi's unemployment protection can be a lifesaver for a borrower who loses their job. Once a job loss has been reported, the lender will put payments on pause for up to three months at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoFi debt consolidation loan requirements\n\n\n\nBe at least 18 years of ageBe a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or non-permanent resident alienHave an income, either from employment or other source. Applicants with an offer of employment scheduled to start within 90 days will also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLendingClub debt consolidation reviewLendingClub is a fintech company working with a network of investors. These investors are specifically looking for people they can loan money to. Loans are available from $1,000 to $40,000, with terms of 36 or 60 months. Because it's a network of investors, there's a good chance you will find funding.Sorry to sound like a broken record here, but if you have a low credit score you're going to get bonked with a much higher interest rate than borrowers with strong credit. If you have a high credit score, you may be better off borrowing from a lender that doesn't charge fees. LendingClub origination fees run from 3% to 6%. That's money you could keep in your bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes LendingClub debt consolidation loans different?\n\nWhat sets LendingClub apart from its competitors is the fact that investors choose which loans they want to fund. And because lenders know they can charge a borrower with a relatively low credit score a higher interest rate, those applicants are more likely to receive funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLendingClub debt consolidation loan requirements\n\n\n\nMust be at least 18 years oldHave a verifiable bank accountBe a U.S. citizen or current resident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Loans debt consolidation loan reviewDid you know that Rocket offers more than home loans? Yep. Rocket also provides personal loans, ideal for consolidating the high-interest debt that's weighing you down. If your credit score is 640 or higher you are eligible to apply for a loan ranging from $2,000 to $45,000. The fly in the ointment is that you could face an origination fee as high as 7% (can you tell we truly dislike origination fees?). Repayment terms are either 36 or 60 months, and you can expect same-day loan approval. You may even receive same-day funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Rocket debt consolidation loans different?\n\nRocket is one of the rare lenders that may be able to provide same-day funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket debt consolidation loan requirements\n\n\n\nMust be at least 18 years of ageMust be a U.S. residentMust have a bank account that can receive payments via ACH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there debt consolidation loans for bad credit?\n\n\n\nYes, there are consolidation loans available if you have bad credit. Here are a few extra steps you can take to increase your chances of getting approved:Check your credit reports for errors. Mistakes can drag your score down. To get started, order a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus. Then, read through each record carefully. If you find a mistake on your credit history, report it to the credit bureau.Get prequalified with multiple lenders. Getting prequalified doesn't affect your credit score -- usually (always ask your lender to confirm, though). By getting prequalified, you can find out whether or not a lender will offer you a loan.Consider secured debt or getting a cosigner. If you're having trouble getting approved for a loan, look into secured loans (loans that require collateral) or asking someone to cosign your loan. Doing one (or both) of these things can make it easier for you to get approved for a debt consolidation loan.For more information, check out our list of best personal loans for bad credit.\n\n\n\nThe best debt consolidation companies of October 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLending Partner\nMin.

Debt consolidation streamlines multiple debt payments into a single payment, using a personal loan.\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of using a personal loan for debt consolidation?\n\n\n\nA debt consolidation program can save you money and time. Here are a few other benefits:Lower interest rate: Most debt consolidation loans have a lower interest rate than credit cards. The best credit card consolidation loans will help you in paying off high-interest debt with a low-interest loan to save you thousands of dollars over the life of a loan.Lower monthly payments: If you have a lower interest rate, you'll likely also have lower monthly payments. If you find yourself worrying about how you're going to repay credit debt or other unsecured debt, a debt consolidation loan can help you lower the total monthly payment due.Clear finish line: From the time a lender approves your consolidation loan, you will know precisely the repayment term and when it's due to be paid off.Fewer bills: Consolidating multiple debt loans into a single personal loan means you will have fewer bills to juggle. If you're busy like most people, having one installment loan to pay can simplify your life. Rather than making sure each credit card payment is sent, writing a check for your auto loan, and double checking that all other bills are covered, you pay a single monthly payment.Higher credit score: You may be able to improve your credit score by making regular payments. Since your credit history plays a role in everything from renting an apartment to whether you qualify for the lowest auto insurance rates, raising your credit score makes life easier. Once you've achieved excellent credit, you will have access to the best interest rates and loan terms next time you need to borrow money.\n\n\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of debt consolidation loans?\n\n\n\nMost financial decisions, including personal loans for debt consolidation, have pros and cons. Here are some drawbacks:If you use your loan to pay off your credit cards, you may be tempted to use those cards again, leaving you with a consolidation loan and new high-interest debt. New debt leads to a higher debt-to-income ratio, an issue that is factored into your credit score.There is often a sense of relief once you've paid off high-interest debt, which may tempt you to spend more money or spend unwisely. The entire point of debt loans are to get you out of debt and make your life easier. Whether you take out a secured loan or an unsecured loan, stick to your budget once the loan is paid in full.If you take out a secured loan using collateral, such as your house or your car, to keep the interest rate low, you risk losing that collateral if you miss payments. It's never a good idea to miss payments, but if you're not sure you will make all payments as agreed, consider an unsecured loan instead.The wrong loan can end up costing you money in interest or fees. Make sure you understand all the costs involved and don't inadvertently put yourself in a worse situation. A high origination fee, late payment fees, and prepayment penalty will each take money out of your pocket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nBudgeting for loan payments\n\nIf you're getting ready to apply for a debt consolidation loan, start by outlining your current monthly expenses and income. Then, estimate how much you can put toward a loan payment each month. (Remember, the loan payment will replace some of your other debt payments.) That way, you'll know ahead of time what size loan payment is best for you -- and you can confidently work toward paying off that debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the alternatives to personal loans for debt consolidation?\n\n\n\nPersonal loans for debt consolidation can be a great way to meet your financial goals, but they're not the only option. Here are some alternatives to a debt consolidation loan:Balance transfer credit cardsA balance transfer card offers an introductory rate, most often a 0% APR for a set time period (typically 12 to 21 months). You apply online, give the new credit card company a list of the balances you want to be transferred, and wait to hear back from it. Transfer fees usually range from 3% and 5% of the balance transferred. But beware: The card's interest rate will rise dramatically as soon as the intro period ends. You should plan to pay the card off in full before then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsNo interest charges on balance transfers during intro periodMay increase your credit score\n\n\n\n\nConsOnly effective if you stop using credit while repaying the debtTransfer fees chargedInterest rate rises dramatically once the intro period ends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome equity loansIf you owe less on your home than it's worth, that means you have equity and can borrow against it. If you use a home equity loan for debt consolidation, you'll owe your mortgage lender instead of your other creditors (like credit card issuers). The interest rate might be lower on a home equity loan than you'd pay on a credit card or personal loan. The danger is that you could lose your home if you miss payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsLikely to provide you with a much lower interest rateCan increase your credit score\n\n\n\n\nConsLender has the right to repossess your home (the collateral) if you fail to make paymentsEasy to get into even more debt unless you stop using other available credit (like credit cards)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401(k) loansWhile the best move with a 401(k) plan -- or any other retirement plan -- is to leave it alone and let it grow, some plans do allow for borrowing. You don't have to worry about your credit score when borrowing from your 401(k) because no credit check is required. A 401(k) loan generally lets you borrow 50% of your 401(k) balance or $50,000, whichever is less (with some exceptions). When you take out a 401(k) loan, you pay interest to yourself by putting your interest payments back into your retirement account. However, if you don't pay back the loan within five years, you will owe income tax and a penalty of 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsNo credit check requiredIn essence, you repay yourself, with interest\n\n\n\n\nConsThe money borrowed has no opportunity to grow, potentially costing you thousands of dollarsIf the loan is not repaid within five years, you'll pay income tax and a penalty of 10%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nWhat is a debt consolidation loan?\n\n\n\nA debt consolidation loan is a loan used to pay off other debt. It usually has a lower interest rate than other debt (like credit card debt). You can also use it to pay off multiple debts -- for example, multiple credit cards or loans. Then, you have only one debt payment to remember instead of several.\n\n\n\n\nDoes consolidating debt affect credit scores?\n\n\n\nYour credit score could climb. Consolidating debt leaves you with more available credit (for example, paid off credit cards). As long as you don't add charges to the cards you just paid off, the \"debt utilization\" portion of your credit score improves. In addition, making monthly payments on time helps boost your score.\n\n\n\n\nWhat credit score do I need for a debt consolidation loan?\n\n\n\nThe credit score required to consolidate debt depends on the lender. Some lenders that cater to those with poor credit consider applicants with scores as low as 560-580.\n\n\n\n\nHow much debt can you consolidate?\n\n\n\nHow much debt you can consolidate depends on a number of factors, including your credit history and income.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does Dave Ramsey say about debt consolidation loans?\n\n\n\nRamsey is not a fan of debt consolidation loans, believing that it will take you longer to repay the debt. In his opinion, the longer it takes you to repay the loan, the more interest you'll pay.We recommend you take Ramsey's advice on this topic with a grain of salt. Crunch the numbers to determine how long it will take you to pay off existing debt at the rate you're paying. Then, find out how much a consolidation loan will cost you monthly. Finally, compare the total interest paid in both scenarios.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Dana George\nOur Loans Expert","Article Date":"August 23, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"22":{"Article Title":"Best Mortgage Lenders & Mortgage Rates as of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/mortgages\/best-mortgage-lenders","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

For example, Better's One Day Mortgage program doesn't exactly complete the entire loan process in a day, but it allows qualified borrowers who submit their paperwork quickly to apply, get a pre-approval, lock their rate, and get a loan commitment -- all within 24 hours. This is much quicker than the typical lender can offer, and Better also aims to provide quicker pre-approval letters for borrowers who haven't picked a home to submit with their offers.Not only is Better very transparent about its current mortgage rates, but the company guarantees that it will beat its competitors. Better offers to match a competitor's rate offer and will give you $100 if they can't do it.The company also generally charges lower fees than the competition, which can make a big difference to your closing costs. Plus, Better offers discounts of as much as $2,000 in lender credits and a refund of 1% of the purchase price if you use a real estate agent that was referred by Better.In addition to being fast, Better offers a user-friendly application process that can be completed almost entirely online (signing the final closing documents is the only part that can't). However, Better's system also assigns buyers a home advisor who can be contacted anytime during business hours if you run into trouble or have any questions during the process. The company will also match buyers with a local attorney to help with closing, and bundle adjacent services such as title insurance, home insurance, and settlement services.Better offers conventional, jumbo, and FHA mortgages. It also offers home equity lines of credit ranging from $50,000 to $500,000. Its mortgages can be originated for purchases or refinancing, and can come with fixed or adjustable rates.Of course, no lender is perfect, and Better is no exception. For example, it doesn't offer VA or USDA loans, or construction loans. It doesn't offer alternative loan programs for self-employed borrowers. And while Better's mortgage professionals are generally excellent, for some buyers there is simply no substitute for face-to-face help in a branch.Pros:Fully online mortgage processFaster pre-approval and closing than competitorsRate transparencyHELOCs availableCons:No VA or USDA loansNo branch locationsNo construction loansLearn more about BetterAxos Bank Mortgage Expert ReviewOur rating: 5.0\/5.00 stars.Axos Bank Mortgage is an online financial institution that offers a variety of consumer banking products such as high-yield savings and online checking accounts and is also a top-rated home loan originator. Its banking products are important for mortgage customers to know about because Axos waives its standard $995 lender fee for customers with at least $500 in an Axos Bank account (and you can open one at the same time you apply for a mortgage).In addition, one of the biggest differentiators between Axos and its competitors is its cash back mortgage feature. Axos offers its banking customers who meet certain requirements 3% annualized cash back on mortgage payments (principal and interest), up to $100 per month.Axos offers several different mortgage products, including conventional, FHA, and VA mortgages. It also offers jumbo loans, which happens to be a specialty of the bank, and is one of the few lenders to offer mortgages of as much as $30 million, and with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios as high as 90%. In addition to these rather standard mortgage types, Axos offers a wide variety of unusual loan types, such as portfolio loans, investment property loans, interest-only mortgages, and more.Axos has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and has been in business for more than 20 years. The bank's application process is fully online, except for closing, which typically occurs in person, even with fully online lenders. It is rather easy to check the bank's current mortgage rates, although you'll need to give your email and phone number to do it.There are a few negatives to consider. Axos is not a standout when it comes to customer support. Unlike many online lenders, Axos doesn't have 24\/7 phone support for home loans, and while it offers chat support, it's through a virtual assistant (not a real-live person). Plus, Axos doesn't offer USDA mortgages, and the requirement of being an Axos banking customer to unlock the best features is a drawback for people who have banking relationships elsewhere.Pros:Lots of loan typesLender fee can be waivedCash back featureHigh-balance jumbo loansCons:Best benefits require an Axos bank accountNo branch locationsNo USDA mortgagesCustomer support is lackingLearn more about Axos Bank MortgageVeterans United Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.0\/5.00 stars.Veterans United is a good choice if you're looking for a VA loan. It is the number one VA lender in the U.S. and exclusively originates this particular type of mortgage, and that's the primary reason it earns a spot on our top mortgage lenders list.Veterans United has an online application process that makes it easy to request a rate quote for either a purchase or refinancing loan. However, while the lender is primarily online, Veterans United Home Loans does have a network of 25 physical branches throughout the United States. This is one reason why Veterans United gets top marks for customer service, and there is also 24\/7 live phone support available, making Veterans United a great choice for qualified military personnel, even if they're stationed overseas.The company provides credit counseling services to help borrowers get their scores up to the lender's 620 minimum and its staff are experts in the VA loan process.As with other VA lenders, borrowers are not required to make a down payment, and have the ability to roll the VA funding fee into their loan, keeping out-of-pocket costs to a minimum.The main drawback is that Veterans United only offers VA loans. If you are not qualified for a VA loan, Veterans United will match you with a lending partner to help you. But Veterans United has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, as well as a 4.84 out of five star rating based on nearly 2,700 customer reviews on the BBB platform. This is among the highest of any financial services business on our radar.Pros:VA loan expertsOnline application processTop-notch customer serviceCons:Only offers VA loansLearn more about Veterans UnitedCaliber Home Loans Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.5\/5.00 stars.Caliber Home Loans offers a variety of mortgages through a user-friendly digital application process. One of Caliber's biggest strengths is that it offers a wide variety of home loans. In addition to conventional, FHA, VA, and USDA loans, Caliber also offers jumbo loans, home renovation loans, and several programs designed to provide low-down-payment financing, especially to lower-income and first-time home buyers.It also offers a Smart Series loan program for self-employed individuals and real estate investors, and this is the primary reason it earns a spot on our list.Speed is also a big strength of Caliber Home Loans. It claims to be able to close purchase mortgages in as little as 10 days for borrowers who quickly submit the required documentation. Plus, Caliber is a mortgage servicer unlike many lenders who sell the rights to service their loans after closing, and this can make it easier to transition from closing to repayment.There are certainly a few downsides that borrowers need to be aware of. Rate transparency is a major drawback. While many of the other companies included on our top mortgage lenders list make it easy to view their current rates, or even get personalized rate quotes, Caliber does not. You'll need to make a formal loan application to see what your rates will be.Caliber also doesn't offer home equity loans or HELOCs, so if you want those, you'll need to look elsewhere. And customer satisfaction is a mixed bag. It has below-average marks in the J.D. Power U.S. Primary Mortgage Servicer Satisfaction survey, but also holds an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, which indicates that customer complaints are addressed quickly. In a nutshell, Caliber can be a great choice if you want a quick and efficient closing process, especially if you're a first-time buyer.Pros:Wide variety of loan typesFirst-time home buyer programsLoans for self-employed borrowersQuick closings availableCons:No HELOCs or home equity loansLack of rate transparencyLearn more about Caliber Home LoansloanDepot Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.5\/5.00 stars.loanDepot is a mortgage lender that is a combination of an online lender and a branch-based mortgage originator. While the entire mortgage process (other than closing) can be handled digitally, there are some branches for people who might benefit from in-person help.loanDepot offers some of the most popular mortgage products, such as conventional loans, FHA loans, and jumbo loans, and the company is one of the largest VA lenders in the market. It also offers renovation loans for buyers who want fixer-uppers.The company's smartloan platform enables loandepot to expedite the mortgage process by digitally verifying assets, income, and employment. And it finds unique ways to make the process faster, such as waiving appraisal requirements if there are enough recent comps in the area. loanDepot claims that borrowers can close on loans as many as 17 days faster than competing platforms. The company has been in business for 13 years and has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, which indicates that customer issues get addressed in a timely manner.There are some potential downsides to loanDepot that you should be aware of. It doesn't offer home equity loans or HELOCs, and it doesn't have USDA loans for rural buyers. Plus, its rate transparency isn't great -- you need to fill out an application to get any personalized rate offers.In short, loanDepot is a solid option if you want one of the standard loan types they offer, especially if you're closing on a tight timetable.Pros:Specializes in VA loansEfficient online platformCons:No USDA loansNo home equity loans or HELOCsLack of rate transparencyLearn more about loanDepotNew American Funding Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.5\/5.00 stars.New American Funding offers a wide variety of mortgage products, but focuses on helping minorities and other underserved parts of the population achieve homeownership.First, the variety in mortgage products, New American offers standard conventional loans as well as all three main government-backed loan programs (VA, FHA, and USDA loans). In addition, the company offers non-standard loans such as stated income loans for self-employed borrowers whose tax returns don't reflect their true income, home improvement loans, and even reverse mortgages for older homeowners. One unique feature is that New American's mortgages aren't in just the standard 15, 20 and 30-year terms -- borrowers can choose a custom loan term ranging from eight to 30 years. In other words, if you want a 27-year mortgage, New American deserves a spot on your short list.In addition, New American does a great job of helping borrowers find down payment assistance, and can approve some borrowers with higher debt-to-income (DTI) ratios than the industry's standard 45% maximum.

It has served more than 4 million customers. Its loan process is online-based and there is a lot to like about it.For one thing, it offers an impressive level of rate transparency. Not only can you easily view the lender's current mortgage rates online, but you can even see how paying discount points could help your interest rate and monthly payments. The company also allows customers to lock their rates before they start shopping, and take advantage of a lower rate if they fall before the borrower closes on their home. The mortgage process is completed through PennyMac's user-friendly online portal, known as its Mortgage Access Center.PennyMac has some unique features, such as flexible-term loans that can have term lengths other than the standard 15, 20, and 30-year lengths. It is very transparent about its lender fees, and often offers promotions and credits that make it lower. Plus, as one of the largest mortgage servicers, PennyMac continues to service all of its own loans after closing. If you've ever bought a home and had your mortgage shuffled between banks, you know that this can be quite a pain point.There are some negatives to keep in mind. PennyMac offers flexible term loans but doesn't offer any loan types that aren't the standards that many other lenders offer as well. Plus, PennyMac has a few physical branches, but not in many markets, so if you want in-person help, it might not be ideal.PennyMac has been in business for 15 years and has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, as well as mostly positive customer reviews on the platform. In a nutshell, PennyMac is one of the biggest lenders in the nation for a reason. As long as you're looking for one of the standard mortgage types, it could be a good fit for you.Pros:Great rate transparencyFlexible mortgage termsFee transparencyServices its own loansUser-friendly mortgage processCons:No proprietary mortgage productsFew physical locationsLearn more about PennyMac MortgageSoFi Mortgage Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.0\/5.00 stars.SoFi Mortgage offers a full range of banking products, and is designed to be a fully-online one-stop shop for its members financial needs, and this includes mortgages. SoFi offers conventional, FHA, VA, and jumbo mortgages, as well as HELOCs, and is likely to add more products over time. For example, VA loans are new to the platform.One of the best things about SoFi is its relationship benefits. If you have another account with SoFI, such as an investment account or personal loan, you can get a discount on your mortgage fees. And even if you don't already have a relationship with SoFi, having a mortgage with the company can get you discounts on other financial products you may eventually need.One somewhat rare feature is that SoFi will allow you to check your personalized mortgage rates without a hard credit check and just a quick pre-qualification form. And SoFi is one of the few mortgage lenders that offers a $0 origination fee. And if your loan doesn't close on time (and it isn't your fault), SoFi will pay as much as $5,000.There are a few drawbacks to SoFi Mortgage. As mentioned, it only offers a few different loan types right now. For example, if you're looking for a USDA mortgage, SoFi isn't right for you. And it offers a rate lock program, but it has an expensive fee if you don't go through with a loan.Although SoFi has grown rapidly in recent years, it has actually been in business for well over a decade and has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. The bottom line is that SoFi is a solid mortgage option if you're looking for one of the standard mortgage types, especially if you're already a SoFi customer.Pros:Tons of financial products in one placeRelationship discounts and benefitsTop-notch mobile appView rates with no credit checkCons:Few loan typesHigh fee for rate lock if you don't closeLearn more about SoFi Mortgage\n\n\nReveal Reviews [ + ]\nHide Reviews [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare Mortgage RatesToday's Mortgage Rates | Refinance Rates\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best mortgage lenders\n\n\n\n\nShow The List [+]\nHide The List [-]\n\n\n\n\nNo lender fees and 100% online application:\n\nBetter\n\n\n\nDiverse loan products and cash back rewards:\n\nAxos Bank Mortgage\n\n\n\nTop customer service and streamlined online app.:\n\nRocket Mortgage\n\n\n\nDiverse loan types and terms:\n\nNew American Funding\n\n\n\nDigital experience & down payment assistance:\n\nGuaranteed Rate Mortgage\n\n\n\nRefinancing and FHA\/VA options:\n\nloanDepot\n\n\n\nVA loans:\n\nVeterans United\n\n\n\nHigh loan amounts and relationship discounts:\n\nSoFi Mortgage\n\n\n\nDiverse loan options:\n\nBank of America Mortgage\n\n\n\nNo mortgage insurance option:\n\nNavy Federal Credit Union Mortgage\n\n\n\nDiverse loan offerings:\n\nPNC Mortgage\n\n\n\nEasy online application:\n\nPennyMac Mortgage\n\n\n\nFirst-time buyers:\n\nFlagstar Bank Mortgage\n\n\n\nOnline experience:\n\nAlly Mortgage\n\n\n\nSelf-employed borrowers:\n\nCaliber Home Loans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatings Methodology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Rates  for Better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2023 Award Winner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Rates  for Better\n\nOn\nBetter's\nSecure Website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest for: No lender fees and 100% online application\n\nBetter\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

While it\u2019s impossible for us to rate and review every offer on the market, we canvas as far as we can, reviewing the largest mortgage providers in the United States, and continuously reviewing the mortgage companies and mortgage lenders that enter, and exit, the space.Our five-star rating system takes into account their ease of providing quotes to all borrowers, how comparatively competitive their mortgage rates and fees are, the quality of their online experience and customer support, as well as how versatile a loan is including finance flexibility, repayment terms, down payment options and ease of closing process.For rating mortgage lenders, and assigning mortgage provider award winners by category, we are keenly focused on industry factors and user benefits, including:Competitive rates and feesCustomer serviceOnline experienceLoan optionsTop-rated offerings were selected that we think represent the top pick for the average customer in each category. Our final awards winners were determined by vote to ensure objectivity, with a final Golden Rule check: would we recommend them to a family or friend? Special attention was also paid to:The application processGeographic availabilityCustomer service channel optionsDown payment optionsWhat is a mortgage lender?A mortgage lender is a financial institution that lends money for home loans. Mortgage lenders can come in a few forms; your bank or credit union may offer mortgages, in addition to other bank accounts, or the company could specifically be focused on mortgage lending.Remember, before signing any agreement, make sure you review all of the terms of the contract and completely understand each aspect, including what fees, known as closing costs, you will need to pay when you buy a home.Loan TypesNot all lenders offer all types of mortgage loans. If you need a larger \"jumbo loan,\" or a government-backed loan, you'll need to find a mortgage lender that offers it.What types of home loans should I consider?Conventional and government-insured loans may only require a 3% down payment, while other loans require 20% down. If you\u2019re buying rural, you may qualify for a USDA loan, while veterans should consider VA loans.Knowing the different mortgage options can help you understand which options are best for your lending needs.Mortgage lenders offer different types of loans, and knowing which type of mortgage loan is best for you to apply for, depends on your specific lending needs. Loan type, interest rate, and loan term can vary from one mortgage lender to another, so comparing multiple lenders is often the best move for home buyers.Conventional mortgages are loans without a guarantee from any government agency, and could require a downpayment as low as 3-5%. Conventional loans are funded by private lenders, like the ones featured in our best mortgage lenders list\u00bbWhat mortgage term is best?First, let's talk about mortgage terms, which is simply just the time you have to pay off your mortgage and own your home! Here are the most common mortgage term lengths:Common Fixed Mortgage Term Lengths: The interest rate stays the same for the entirety of the loan term, so your monthly mortgage payments are spread out evenly through the term of the loan. This option is great with low interest rate environments - make sure to ask about rate lock if you think rates may increase to secure that lower interest rate!15-Year Mortgage Payoff Term20-Year Mortgage Payoff Term30-Year Mortgage Payoff Term (most common)Common Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM) Term Lengths: The interest rate stays the same for a certain period of time (sometimes up to 10 years), and then may change (adjust) at specified intervals (usually every six months).5\/1 ARM Payoff Terms7\/1 Arm Payoff TermsSo, why does that matter? Well, the longer your mortgage term, the longer you have to pay. This normally translates to a lower monthly mortgage payment. But which mortgage term is right for you can depend! Check out this video for an example of a 30 year mortgage vs a 15 year mortgage.In this video, Dan Caplinger, The Motley Fool's director of investment planning, compares the rates and payback terms of a 15 year mortgage vs a 30 year mortgage.Key video takeaways: A 30-year mortgage provides more payment option flexibility by allowing you to make lower monthly payments, but the ability to make larger payments, or more frequent payments when you can, to pay your mortgage off earlier. He also points out that you may have a better chance of getting a 30 year mortgage approved in tougher lending environments, since the lower monthly mortgage payment amount will be a smaller portion of your overall monthly income.Government-backed mortgage loans or conforming loans are backed by the Federal government and have different requirements, based on your scenario:VA mortgage loan (offered through the Veterans Administration) - VA loans do not require a down payment and are available to active duty and military veterans. Note: a one-time VA funding fee is required but it can be rolled into the mortgage loan payment and does not have to be paid upfront.USDA loan (offered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Housing Loan Program) - USDA mortgages do not require a down payment and are an option for homebuyers in rural areas, some eligible towns, and some borrowers with a lower income. Note: an annual guarantee fee must be paid upfront, but you do not have to pay for PMI.FHA loan (offered through private FHA-approved mortgage lenders, and insured by the Federal Housing Administration) - FHA mortgages are great for low down payment options (sometimes as low as 3.5% down) and often accommodate lower credit scores, or borrowers that have experienced bankruptcy. FHA loans can also be used for different types of homes from single and multi-family to condos and manufactured homes. Note: mortgage insurance is required.Qualifying requirements to get a home loanMortgage lenders vary in terms of qualifying requirements: interest rates, fees charged, and a host of other factors. Some lenders have stricter standards than others for credit score, income, employment history, and other qualifying factors. For example, some lenders may offer better terms to borrowers with poor credit than other lenders do. Or some may be more forgiving of a low down payment or high debt balance.Required down paymentFor conventional loans, lenders may require a 20% down payment to avoid private mortgage insurance. That's insurance homeowners pay for to protect against lender losses in the event of foreclosure. However, it's possible to find lenders willing to offer loans with less money down. That's especially true if you choose a government-backed loan.Common fees when getting a home loanHome Loan fees, lender fees, and costs associated with a mortgage:Mortgage loan origination fees: It's common to see an origination fee that includes application costs, costs for a credit check, and underwriting fees. Most of these lender fees are paid as part of your closing costs. Some lenders charge more fees than others, but fees could total in the thousands.Interest rates: Interest is the cost of borrowing. The lower the rate, the lower the monthly payment and total costs. The best mortgage lenders offer a more competitive interest rate, but interest rates are also impacted by your credit score, credit report findings, and your location. See more about how mortgage interest rates are impacted by rate environments\u00bbPMI is Private Mortgage Insurance, which is required when the downpayment on your home is less than 20% of the home's value.Reasons to avoid PMIHow to get rid of PMIAdditional fees: You may also have appraisal and titling feesMost common fees associated with home ownershipHomeowners insurance is often a mortgage lender required policy that must be obtained when you purchase a new home as a protection if your house needs repairs. Since the lender technically owns the property until you've fully paid off the loan, they want to ensure insurance is in place to protect their investment, and so should you! Homeowners insurance policies can vary based on property type. Check out this guide to homeowners insurance premiums.HOA is short for homeowners association and is a governing body of some neighborhoods that often require a monthly, quarterly, or annual fee once you move in. Make sure you ask about HOA fees to ensure you pad that into your budget, and check out why it may be worth it to move into a development that has a home owners association. Learn more about homeowners association (HOA) feesMaintenance and repair costsProperty taxes, which can vary by stateUnderwriting process approval timeFind out how long it will take your mortgage provider to have a loan approved; some mortgage lenders are able to complete the loan approval process much more quickly. This could be a factor if you're on a tight deadline.ReputationA lender's reputation for customer service does matter a little. You want the application process to be easy and pleasant. But be aware that many lenders resell mortgages. There's a chance the original lender you borrow from will not remain your loan servicer for long.Important mortgage terms and topics to knowHome Equity also referred to \"equity\" is short, relates to the amount of your home you have already paid off.This is important because you can use your home equity as collateral to borrow against using a Home Equity Loan or HELOC (home equity line of credit). See the differences in these home loan and HELOC options\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest mortgage lender for 2023: Rocket Mortgage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Overall Mortgage Lender for 2023\nRocket Mortgage\n\n\n\n\nRating image, 5.0 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0 stars\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Due to the size of the mortgage industry in the U.S. there are many lending platforms and mortgage information sites on the internet. I searched for \"mortgage rates\" and ended up with 674 million results. For comparison purposes, searching for \"NFL\" brought up 496 million results. Granted, this could result in decision paralysis with this much information. I would recommend starting with your current bank\/credit union, and include other lenders from [review] sites. It is likely the lender you choose will end up selling your loan through the mortgage-backed securitization process. So focus on lower rates and fees. Customer service is less under your control.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?The loan decision is standardized in the mortgage market due to the participation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (two government-sponsored enterprises that buy and sell about half of U.S. mortgages). FICO\u00ae Score, current income, and availability of money for a down payment are the most important factors. The efficiency of the mortgage market works against underserved communities where the ability to build a prime FICO\u00ae Score (above 720) can be more difficult. If you do not have the opportunity to build a credit history then it is more difficult to obtain an affordable mortgage. Therefore, the issue for underserved communities is the opportunity to create a solid credit history.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?Building a credit history is the key. This starts with on-time payment of bills (utilities, cable, cellphone) and then moves on to other opportunities like credit cards. Utilizing a credit card as a debit card, for only small-ticket purchases that can be paid off in full every month, also helps build credit. There are also programs through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's FHA program targeted directly at helping underserved communities become homeowners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClifford Rossi\n\nExecutive-in-Residence and Professor of the Practice at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nHow can homebuyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender? First, ever since the financial crisis in 2008, a number of measures were taken to strengthen and improve oversight of mortgage lending practices in the industry. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established in part to address many of the deficient and sometimes predatory lending practices that occurred at that time. As a result, mortgage lenders, even those nonbank mortgage entities that are not regulated as closely as commercial banks and other depositories at the federal level must comply with all applicable federal state and local laws regarding mortgage lending. Generally, in shopping around for a lender you can trust, I would look at their track record in terms of complaints which are available at the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database. References from friends and family are another good way of benchmarking lenders in terms of how they handled the loan process. Regulated depositories, according to my research, tend to have far less operational problems in loan origination than nonbank financial institutions in terms of how they follow the process required to underwrite borrowers for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac-eligible loans. So that might be another factor to consider as well.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities? We are approaching the end of a very long secular decline in interest rates that has spanned decades. At some point we expect the Fed to begin the process of taking measures that will start to raise interest rates including US Treasuries. Since the 10-year US Treasury yield is the benchmark for setting 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates, we should expect that higher rates are going to dampen demand for mortgages at some point. Lower income borrowers, including minority borrowers, are going to feel the impact first of higher interest rates which will further put the dream of homeownership out of reach during a period of time when there are acute housing affordability issues already.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I'll offer a few tips. The first is one that every borrower needs to do first. Check your credit score and credit history through one of the readily available credit reporting companies and services and find out if there are any issues that you can address prior to applying for a mortgage. The second tip is look at your current finances. Add up all your outstanding monthly debt including credit card, student debt and the like and divide that by your monthly income. The lower that debt-to-income ratio is, the better chance you have at getting a loan. Also, determine how much money you have to put down on a home. Make sure you leave yourself with enough cash or short-term assets that you can tap for an unexpected event and for home maintenance. If you are a first-time homebuyer, do some homework or take a class on what to expect in owning a home. These activities can really help put you in good shape to find the right home and mortgage for your family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChester S. Spatt\n\nProfessor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nHow can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?It is important for home buyers to undertake sufficient search to obtain quotes from various prospective lenders before selecting one -- especially given the range of pricing that can arise. They also should try potentially to clarify the servicing process with the lender (or even check with other borrowers of the lender about their experience, if feasible).How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?The decline in interest rates has contributed to high house prices and loan values, as buyers would bid more aggressively.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I would reinforce my advice (above) -- it is very important for home buyers to undertake ample search so as to ensure that they are receiving favorable pricing on their loans as underserved communities are especially vulnerable to attempts to exercise market power. This may be at the heart of the meaning of a community being \"underserved.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Manahan\n\nLecturer at California State University Dominguez Hills, Author and Consultant\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nHow can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?The first thing to understand about home lenders is that many of the companies that advertise mortgage loans are not really lenders. They are brokers. The money is not coming from them -- it is coming from a lender (to whom the broker takes the loan). As an example, I financed my last mortgage through Right Choice Mortgage. However, the loan was made to me from Glendale Credit Union.The second thing to understand is that even if you go directly to a lender, the lender may still act as a broker. A lender, such as Bank of America, could give you a mortgage. But they could just as easily \"sell off\" the mortgage to a group of investors in the mortgage aftermarket. Why? Because this frees up the bank's capital to make more loans.Who you choose to help you obtain a mortgage really depends on two things: 1) Your personal financial situation and, 2) What sort of relationship you want with a mortgage lender. If you have a complex personal financial situation, such as having multiple sources of income, being self-employed, having investment properties, and owning LLCs, or previous bankruptcies, you may find that some mortgage companies don't want to bother working with you (because it will take more time and effort to get your mortgaged approved). Also, many of the large automated or semi-automated mortgage companies where you apply online don't have the right \"boxes\" on their application for you to explain everything. You can end up in a quagmire of endless frustration working with these companies.Even if you have a straightforward financial situation, you still must decide what sort of relationship you want with the mortgage company. Are you okay doing everything online or do you need to fill out forms by hand? Do you want to speak to the same person every time or are you okay with talking to whichever one of the hundreds of people in the call center answers the phone? Do you need someone who can walk you through the process and explain things to you, or are you an old \"mortgage pro\" who understands how the system works? Making the right decision will make your mortgage application process a whole lot easier.Whoever you choose to work with to get a mortgage, before getting in too deep, find out how they do business and if their style fits in with your needs. Finally, if you do use one of those online brokers, if you can't find the phone number on the home page, don't use them.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?Interest rate changes affect home buying. When interest rates drop, homes become more affordable because loan payments go down. As an example, if you purchased a home for $600,000 (the average price of a home in California) and put 20% down, you would have a $480,000 mortgage. At 3% interest your payment before taxes and insurance would be $2,024. At a 5% interest rate, your payment would be $2,577, or 27% higher. As lenders typically look for your cost of housing to be no more than 30% of your income, lower interest rates should allow more people to get mortgages, and higher interest rates will restrict mortgages.However, changes in mortgage interest rates do not affect all communities the same. Obviously very rich people, who may still mortgage their homes for tax or financial planning purposes, have few restraints on their ability to get a mortgage. At the lower end of the scale, the least expensive house may continue to sell well when interest rates rise because there are many programs to help underserved and first-time buyers. FHA loans are specifically intended for lower-income, lower-credit, and\/or first-time home buyers. This program, which is backed by the Federal Housing Administration, makes it easier to become a homeowner by relaxing the standards borrowers must meet to get a mortgage.The communities that get hit hardest (or benefit the most) when interest rates change are those communities where the home prices are above average, but not high enough to be of interest to rich people. As an example, in California, that might include communities where the home prices are in the $1 million to $1.5 million range. I recall the recession of 2008, when the value of real estate dropped substantially, there was still demand for the least expensive houses and still demand for mega-mansions of the rich. But those million-dollar homes couldn't find many buyers.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I offer three tips to members of underserved communities to get the best rates possible. First, do whatever you can to improve your credit score. Even in underserved communities credit scores are one of the primary indicators of credit worthiness used by our financial system.Second, work with a bank or lender that is familiar with all the programs that are available to underserved communities. Some mortgage companies may not want to use these programs because they may be extra work. Find a mortgage company who can talk frankly to you about those programs that are available and that you can use to your benefit.Finally, make sure the mortgage company knows that you are a member of an underserved community. Today when we do a lot of business online or on the phone, it may be difficult for the lender to know that you are member of an underserved community which under the broad-based definition recently provided by the White House is said to include \"people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.\" That definition covers a lot of people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Deacle\n\nAssociate Professor of Business and Economics and Department Chair at Ursinus College\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nHow can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?The most effective way is to get quotes from multiple lenders. Time consuming as it is, the extra work pays off with leverage in your discussions with those lenders. If you know what other lenders are offering, each lender is likely to try to match or beat the rates you are getting with other lenders.Another way is to obtain a mortgage from the bank or credit union where you have your checking or savings accounts. Such lenders sometimes offer discounts to their account holders.You can also compare the rates lenders are offering to national benchmark rates, such as those published by Freddie Mac.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?I think changing interest rates have similar impacts across communities. When interest rates fall, they generally fall for all borrowers.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?Many issues surrounding loans to members of underserved communities stem from issues with credit scores and credit reports. My one tip is to obtain the free credit report to which you are entitled by law and review it for inaccuracies before applying for a mortgage. If there are errors in your credit report, correcting them will improve your credit score, which in turn could get you a lower interest rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Mortgage Loan ProcessMortgage lenders set the terms of your mortgage, including the mortgage interest rate, your creditworthiness, and home loan repayment schedule, based on their assessment of your ability to pay back the loan. All of this is determined in the \"underwriting\" process, before you are offered a unique loan option.Whether you are a first time homebuyer, considering buying a second home, or ready to get financing for an investment property, there are mortgage basics that you'll need to know for each scenario, and essential mortgage guides to help make getting a mortgage as seamless as possible. Understand how the mortgage process works\u00bbRemember: you can switch mortgage lenders anytime before servicing begins (before your home loan is issued). If service has already started, or you've already made your first payment, you'll need to refinance your home to switch mortgage lenders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntip_light_bulb\nexported from figma\n\n\n\nTIP\n\n\n\nSaving on Mortgage Costs\n\nAsk your mortgage lender if any mortgage fees can be rolled directly into your mortgage loan, or whether you will need to pay them out of pocket.And, if you have any other existing accounts with the lender you choose, ask about any mortgage relationship discount offers for your home loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Your Start Shopping for a HomeSelecting your mortgage financing company and terms may seem a bit overwhelming, but we're here to help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for Financing a Property\n\n\n\n\nGet ready to gather some serious documentation! For mortgage lenders to decide how much they can lend you, they'll be taking a deep dive into your financial history, looking to understand your motivations for purchase, and ensuring that you will be able to afford your mortgage payment, as well as other common fees and costs associated with homeownership.How Much House I Can Afford?Get a Mortgage Pre-ApprovalFind the best mortgage lender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting a custom mortgage quote for mortgage preapprovalYou should secure a mortgage preapproval before you start shopping for homes. A mortgage pre-approval is a letter stating how much money you can borrow to purchase your property, and what your interest rate might be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis helps you, and the real estate agent, understand your price range when shopping for your new property. More importantly, mortgage preapprovals also go a long way when you\u2019re ready to make an offer. Showing the seller that you've been pre-approved may make them more willing to accept your offer, as a sign that there won't be any financing issues.\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get preapproved for a home loanThe top mortgage lenders on this list can also help with understanding the advantages, and cautionary tales, of different mortgage financing options for your unique situation, to help you get approved for a mortgage.\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Underwriting AnalysisIn order to qualify for a home loan, lenders will review several factors like your credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment history, and the amount you'll be able to afford for your down payment on your home.5 of the most common questions mortgage lenders ask6 income questions mortgage lenders askLearn more below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is a monthly mortgage payment related to credit score?The table below shows the APR and monthly mortgage payment based on FICO scores, assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan for $300,000.Does credit score matter for getting a mortgage?Yes!

But some loans, including a VA loan, have no minimum credit score requirements at all. Other government-backed loans, such as FHA loans, are available with scores as low as 500 as long as you have a 10% down payment.See how to improve your credit score\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFICO Score\n\n\nAPR\n\n\nMonthly Payment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n620-639\n\n\n4.191%\n\n\n$1,201\n\n\n\n\n640-659\n\n\n3.645%\n\n\n$1,237\n\n\n\n\n660-679\n\n\n3.215%\n\n\n$1,265\n\n\n\n\n680-699\n\n\n3.001%\n\n\n$1,300\n\n\n\n\n700-759\n\n\n2.824$\n\n\n$1,372\n\n\n\n\n760-850\n\n\n2.602%\n\n\n$1,465\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MyFICO\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Time Home Buyer ResourcesThe biggest hurdle for first-time homebuyers (FTHB) is understanding exactly how the mortgage loan process works from start to finish.Check out these FTHB guides, that will help with finding a realtor, through negotiating purchase price and options, and what to do after you've moved into your new home!First Time Homebuyer GuideFirst Time Home Buyer Programs & GrantsMortgage Calculator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Calculator: How Much House Can I Afford?\n\n\n\n\nTarget Monthly Payment\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter an amount you can comfortably afford monthly.

Look for lenders that allow you to check rates with only a soft credit check. That allows you to avoid damaging your credit score. Compare rates and fees to assess total costs of borrowing.If you want the best loan at the most competitive rate, the following can help:Increase your credit scorePay down your debtChoose a shorter loan termMake a larger down payment\n\n\n\n\nWhich mortgage company is the best mortgage lender?\n\n\n\nDifferent lenders are right for different types of mortgage borrowers. The best mortgage lender for you is one that offers the most affordable overall borrowing costs. That's after taking fees and interest into account. You'll also want to make sure your lender offers the best loan term for you. And check that you can qualify for the loans they offer.Since every borrower has a slightly different lending profile, there isn't one mortgage lender that's best in every situation. As a result, it's important to compare rates and quotes from numerous mortgage loan providers to see which is best for you.\n\n\n\n\nWhat credit score do you need to get a mortgage?\n\n\n\nMost mortgage lenders set the minimum credit score for a mortgage at around 620. But some loans, including a VA loan, have no minimum credit score requirements at all. Other government-backed loans, such as FHA loans, are available with scores as low as 500 as long as you have a 10% down payment.\n\n\n\n\nWhich mortgage lender has the best terms?\n\n\n\nMortgage companies and mortgage lenders vary in terms of qualifying requirements: interest rates, fees charged, and a host of other factors. There's no one lender that's the best for every borrower. That's because your rates and costs are largely determined by your particular financial situation.For example, some lenders may offer better terms to borrowers with poor credit than other lenders do. Or some may be more forgiving of a low down payment or high debt balance.To find the best terms for your home loan, shop around and compare mortgage rates, mortgage fees, payoff times, and total costs from multiple lenders.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the best banks for mortgages?\n\n\n\nDifferent lenders are right for different types of mortgage borrowers.

And interest may be tax deductible. Use this mortgage calculator to estimate different mortgage scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nAre mortgage loans secured loans?\n\n\n\nHome loans offered by mortgage providers are typically secured loans. That means your house acts as collateral, and can be taken by the lender if you don't pay the loan.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a hard money lender and how does it work?\n\n\n\nHard money lenders are generally private investors or private companies, not traditional mortgage lenders, that can help finance investment or commercial properties.What's the difference between getting a mortgage and a hard money loan?Both hard money loans and traditional mortgages are secured loans which use your property as collateral, but hard money lenders are focused specifically on lending out hard money loans, using your property, or an asset, as collateral.A hard money loan is a short-term, non-conforming loan whereas a traditional mortgage is generally a longer term conforming loanFinancing for a hard money loan is only applicable for investment or commercial properties vs traditional mortgages which can also cover primary & secondary residences and other property types.Hard money lenders aren\u2019t subject to the same rules & regulations as traditional mortgage lenders (conforming loan lenders)Hard money lenders may require the borrower to prove a history of successful house flips or investing endeavors to get approvedHard money loans generally have higher interest rates vs traditional mortgage lenders because of the higher lending risk they are takingHard money lenders generally require large down payments vs traditional mortgage lendersHard money lenders have a smaller pay-back window vs traditional mortgage lenders. Repayment periods for hard money loans may just be a few years vs an option for a 15 or 30 year term with traditional mortgages.Why would you get a hard money loan?Common reasons people look to hard money loans: financing for flipping houses, purchasing an investment property, financing a commercial propertyHard money loans and lenders may have a faster approval process time (sometimes funding can be within days) vs traditional mortgage lenders (which may take a month or more within the underwriting process).Why? It's based on the value of the property you want to purchase vs your own creditworthiness (less focus on debt-to-income DTI ratios, credit scores, credit history, etc.).Hard money lenders may also promise to close and provide financing within just a few days.Investors may turn to hard money lenders if their application for a traditional mortgage loan is denied, though we always recommend improving your credit score to be able to take advantage of better financing options.

Or, if you have significant equity in the home, you could choose to get a new loan for a higher amount and get some cash in the process.\n\n\n\nWhy should I refinance with one of the best mortgage lenders?\n\n\n\nRefinancing your mortgage is a great way to access your home equity or change the financial circumstances around your mortgage. It can be a powerful weapon for a homeowner who's kept up with their mortgage payments.In fact, you might not even have to leave your house or pick up a phone to complete the entire refinancing process! Some of our favorite mortgage companies have streamlined the process, and you might be able to refinance your mortgage entirely online.You may want to refinance your mortgage if you're looking to:Reduce your monthly mortgage payment. If you're 10 years into a 30-year mortgage, you can refinance the remaining amount to spread those 20 years of payments across 30 years, lowering your monthly payment.Lock in a lower interest rate. Mortgage interest rates have fallen from their 2022 highs, so many homeowners can lower their interest rates by refinancing. If you've had a mortgage for a while and have made your payments on time, a new lender may be willing to offer you a lower rate than what you're currently paying -- potentially saving you thousands of dollars. Even a small change can make a big difference. For example, you'll pay $23,400 more with a 6.25% rate than a 6% one on a $400,000 30-year mortgage over the term of the loan.Convert an adjustable-rate mortgage (or ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage. Adjustable-rate mortgages are interest-rate sensitive, so they can start to get pretty expensive as interest rates increase. A refinance is a great opportunity to lock in a fixed-rate mortgage for the remainder of your home loan, and can be an especially good idea when interest rates fall. For more on refinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, check out our guide.Tap home equity to pay for a large project (like an addition or a remodel). While a refinance isn't the only way to get funds for a home improvement project, it means you aren't paying service on extra debt (unlike, say, with a home equity line of credit or a second mortgage) -- instead, you're just converting some of your equity to cash. This is known as a cash-out refi.Make sure you're refinancing with one of the best refinancing lenders not just because you can, but because you need it to achieve your financial goals.Note: If you would like to learn about some of the major players in the mortgage industry, check out The Ascent's research piece on the largest mortgage lenders.\n\n\n\nWhat are the risks of refinancing?\n\n\n\nThe main risk of refinancing is that it won't be as worthwhile as you think. We'll get into this a bit more in the next section, but a lower interest rate on your mortgage only makes sense if it saves you money relative to the cost of the loan itself.It can also be risky if you're refinancing from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate loan, or vice versa. For example, let's say you have a fixed-rate mortgage at 7% and you refinance to an adjustable-rate mortgage that has a 5% interest rate for five years, but then adjusts annually after that. If market interest rates spike, you can end up paying significantly more interest over time than you would if you had simply kept your existing mortgage.\n\n\n\nWhat is a good refinance rate?\n\n\n\nThe short answer is it depends. Your refinancing rate depends on market conditions, your FICO\u00ae Score, and the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio of your home. When refinancing with the best refinance companies, your goal should be to get an interest rate that is in line with or better than the current market average for people with a similar credit score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much could you save by refinancing?\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Monthly Payment\n{{ result.monthly_current_error }} \n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Loan Balance\n{{ result.current_balance_error }} \n\n\n\n\n\nTime Remaining On Loan (Years)\n{{ result.years_remaining_error }} \n\n\n\n\n\nRefi Mortgage Term (Years)\n\n\n30 years\n20 years\n15 years\n10 years\n\n\n\nRefi Interest Rate\n{{ result.refi_interest_rate_error }} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{ calcResult }}\n\n\nFill out the inputs to see how much you can save in total and in monthly payments with a refinance\n\n\n\n\n\n{{ result.msg_monthly_payment }}\n\n\n$ {{ result.monthlySavings.toString().replace('-','') }} \/ Month\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new monthly payment would be:\n\n\n$ {{ result.newMonthlyDisplay }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{ result.msg1_total }}\n\n\n$ {{ result.totalSavingsDisplay.replace(\"-\",\"\") }} \n\n\n{{ result.msg2_total }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you refinance?\n\n\n\nRefinancing isn't right for everyone, so it depends on your situation. It largely depends on how much it costs to refinance and how long you plan to stay in your home.One common misconception is that refinancing is free or that it costs the same with every lender. And this isn't the case at all -- borrowers should expect closing costs in the thousands when refinancing. To be sure, this can still be well worth it if you're planning to stay in your home long enough so that the savings outweigh the cost.Here's an example. Let's say that you can lower your monthly mortgage payment by $50 if you refinance, but it will cost you $2,000 in various fees to get the loan. Dividing $2,000 by $50 shows that you would need to stay in the home for at least 40 months for refinancing to be worthwhile.To determine if refinancing is the right decision for you, check out our guide on whether or not refinancing is worth it.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLender\nBest For\nNext Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2023 Award Winner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter\n\n\nRating image, 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 stars\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

You want to refinance if you expect to save more from lower interest payments than the fees you pay for the refinancing. This requires you to estimate how long you will stay in your home. If you plan to move soon, then you won't be paying lower interest for long, so you won't offset the refinancing fees. But if you plan to stay in your house for a long time, then you will save more in interest over time than you pay for the refinancing. There are free refinance calculators on the web that can help you figure out how long it will take to offset the refinancing fee.A second reason to refinance is if your income has increased and you can afford a larger payment. If so, you might benefit from refinancing from a longer-term mortgage (say, 30 years) to a shorter-term mortgage (say, 10 years). With the shorter-term mortgage, you have higher payments, but the interest that you pay over the life of the loan will be much lower.A third reason is that your credit-worthiness has improved. This can happen if your credit score improves, your income dramatically increases, or your home increases substantially in value. You can lower your rate substantially and get better terms in these scenarios.How often should someone refinance their mortgage?It depends on interest rates. There's usually no reason to refinance when interest rates are rising. But if they are falling, as they generally have since 2007, it might make sense to refinance every three or four years, depending on the size of your loan and its time to maturity. You need to check the calculators to see how much you can save and then determine if you will remain in your home long enough to offset the refinancing fees.A pitfall that is easy to overlook is that you can unwittingly end up paying far more interest if you continually refinance mortgages, even though you've lowered monthly payments. Consider someone who refinances his or her mortgage every three years and gets a new 30-year mortgage each time. After the third refinancing, that person has much lower payments. But that person also has 30 years left on the mortgage and could end up taking 39 years to be free of debt on their house. The extra nine years of payments mean nine more years of interest. At some point, the borrower should pay more than the minimum monthly payments -- to speed the retirement of the debt and reduce total interest payments -- or refinance into a short-term mortgage.What are some tips for people wondering how to refinance their mortgage?It's very easy to apply for a refinance. Many lenders have easy web-based refinancing sites. You should certainly obtain multiple quotes. Check out the big national lenders, but also check out local lenders and the bank or credit union at which you have a checking account. They may give you a better deal if you are an existing customer. Make use of calculators to help you compare rates and to study the impact of \"points\" on your overall costs.Before applying to refinance, take advantage of your guaranteed-by-law free credit report to make sure your credit history is accurate. Your credit score plays an important role in determining your interest rate.In addition, mortgage lenders often encourage refinancing customers to borrow to pay their refinancing fee. Be careful. This adds to your overall debt burden and increases the interest you will pay over the life of the loan. Ideally, you will pay the refinance fee from your savings so you don't increase the principal on your mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Manahan\n\nLecturer at California State University Dominguez Hills, Author and Consultant\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nWhen should someone consider refinancing their mortgage?The simple answer is whenever the savings in interest rates reasonably offset the closing costs of a new mortgage. However, there are other reasons to refinance even if you cannot get a better interest rate. If you have a variable rate on your mortgage, your mortgage payment may go up if interest rates rise. Refinancing with a fixed-rate mortgage will eliminate this risk. If you have paid off some of your mortgage, refinancing should reduce your monthly payment and leave more cash for vacations or living expenses. This option is a good option for someone whose income is not expected to increase (people living on some sort of fixed income). Finally, if you have equity in your home, you could refinance and take out cash for home improvements or investments, such as buying a rental property.How often should someone refinance their mortgage?You should refinance your mortgage when rates fall below the rate you are paying, but what if rates keep falling? Should you keep refinancing? That is not an easy question to answer because when you refinance you may get a better interest rate, but refinancing costs money. There are appraisal fees, closing costs, title fees, escrow fees, and sometimes points. All these charges can add up to thousands of dollars. Also, when you refinance there is a good chance your credit score will drop, as \"new credit\" and \"credit inquiries\" are two things that negatively affect your credit score. If you need credit for anything else, such as a car loan, bathroom or kitchen remodel, or anything else that is paid with consumer credit, you may find you will be charged a higher rate of interest on those loans. Also, when you do refinance the underwriter wants to see your previous loan \"seasoned\" which means you have made the payments on time for a certain period. Depending on the underwriter, that could be anywhere from six to 12 months. If you apply to refinance too soon, you may not get as good of an interest rate as you hoped.What are some tips for people wondering how to refinance their mortgage?I have refinanced properties with dozens of lenders and mortgage brokers over the years. I'd love to tell you there is some secret to make applying for and getting a mortgage easier. If there is, I haven't found it. But to the degree you can make it a little easier, there are some things you can do. First, have your paperwork ready. The lender is going to want tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements, 401(k) account statements, mortgage statements, brokerage account statements, and possibly more. Download electronic copies of all these documents so when asked, you can quickly upload them or email them to the lender. Second, check your credit report. The lender will want you to explain any negative aspect of your credit report and any credit inquiry that has been made recently. Third, when choosing to use a lender or mortgage broker, don't be fooled by all the low interest rate ads. The interest rate you are going to pay is based on the underwriter's assessment of your risk. I have an excellent credit score, excellent credit history, low amount of debt, good income, and reasonably high net worth. Yet I've never been able to get those rates they advertise. Finally, think about your style. Are you okay doing everything online and talking to whoever in the call center answers the phone or do you want a specific person handling your transaction whom you can reach out to with questions or to help you through the process?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClifford Rossi\n\nExecutive-in-Residence and Professor of the Practice at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nWhen should someone consider refinancing their mortgage?You should keep an eye on the level and possible direction of interest rates over time and compare that with the rate on your existing mortgage to see if there's a benefit from refinancing. Technically, when prevailing rates fall below your existing mortgage rate you may have an opportunity to effectively swap out your old mortgage with a new one at a lower rate. We call that a rate-and-term refinance. But you need to be mindful of the overall cost of refinancing to ensure you are truly getting an all-in lower rate. Specifically, pay attention to how many points and fees you are being asked to pay upfront if any, as that can reduce the benefit you'll get from just the lower rate.You may also find that in some cases refinancing for a home renovation project might be a good idea if you have experienced a significant increase in the equity stake of your home which many homeowners have seen in the recent run up in home prices. We call this a cash-out refinance. That is, you can replace your existing home mortgage with a new one and actually take cash out of the property for improvements and the like. But these cash-out refinances can be risky so make sure to understand what the impact on your new mortgage payment and payment terms are before taking out such a refinance option.Lastly, these days there's a better than ever chance that interest rates will rise than fall going forward so borrowers that currently have very low adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) may want to consider switching out at some point into a fixed-rate loan if they believe they will be in the home for some time in order to lock in a relatively low mortgage rate now as a hedge against potential future rate increases.How often should someone refinance their mortgage?It really depends on things like market conditions. For example, many years ago, mortgage rates were in a period of steady decline such that I had friends going through multiple refinances in a single year as many lenders were offering no-closing-cost refinances which meant that the borrower did not incur any costs for the new loan. Even when rates fell by as little as 25 basis points (0.25%) under those circumstances borrowers were incentivized to refinance. With more lenders offering electronic loan applications, the process to apply for a loan refinance has become more efficient, thus providing borrowers with potentially greater opportunities to act when rate conditions are favorable. Overall, there are no rules on how often one can refinance and certainly as long as the borrower continues to pay the mortgage as agreed it should not detrimentally affect their credit profile for a standard rate-and-term refinance.What are some tips for people wondering how to refinance their mortgage?The internet has substantially changed things for the better for borrowers compared to years ago. Now you can go to any of several websites that provide current mortgage rates, including Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS), to get a sense of where mortgage rates for various products are. Once you determine whether current rates are lower than the rate you have now, then shop around with several lenders to see what you can get in terms of both rate and fees they will charge. Pay particular attention to those fees and points and make sure you get in writing exactly what the new loan terms and costs will be. Lenders must provide that to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Adams\n\nAssociate Dean of Graduate Programs, Pamplin School of Business at the University of Portland\n\nRead More\n\n\n\nWhen should someone consider refinancing their mortgage?Refinancing makes sense when the reduction in monthly mortgage payment (due to lower interest rates) is greater than the cost of refinancing the loan. The important variable here is the length of time you expect to remain in the home. Usually you would need to stay in the home for at least another three to five years for the reduction in loan payments to offset the refi fees.Refinancing may also make sense if the homeowner can use the accrued equity in the house to reinvest in the house for maintenance and upgrades.

Keeping that in mind, we take our ratings and picks very seriously. While it\u2019s impossible for us to rate and review every offer on the market, we canvas as far as we can. Our five-star rating system takes into account how competitive rates and fees are for a certain lender, the online experience and customer support, as well as how versatile a loan is including repayment terms, availability, downpayment options, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat types of loans are available for first-time home buyers?Many first-time home buyers don't have excellent credit histories, and many others don't have large down payments available. Some have served in the Armed Forces and can access VA loans, while others might be able to explore USDA financing if their homes are in certain rural areas.With that in mind, here's a quick overview of the four major mortgage types first-time home buyers can use.Conventional mortgagesThe majority of purchase mortgage loans in the United States are known as conventional loans. This is a broad term that refers to loans that aren't guaranteed by a government agency. The lack of a guarantee means that conventional mortgages generally have stricter qualification requirements than the other loan types listed here. But they could still be excellent options for first-time buyers with strong credit scores. There are several conventional mortgage programs for first-time buyers that allow for down payments as low as 3% of the purchase price.FIND OUT MORE: Guide to Buying Your First HomeFHA loansFHA mortgage loans are guaranteed, or insured, by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Because of this guarantee, credit requirements are generally looser than other types of mortgages, and down payments can be as low as 3.5%, even with a relatively low credit score. What's more, most closing costs can be rolled into the loan, further reducing your out-of-pocket cash requirement. While there are a few drawbacks to FHA loans, especially when it comes to costs, they can be a great way for buyers who don't have stellar qualifications to become homeowners.Compare lenders: Best FHA LendersCompare rates: Today's FHA Mortgage RatesVA loansA VA loan is a mortgage that is backed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and these are available to certain military members, both past and present. VA loans have no down payment requirement, low interest rates, and flexible credit qualifications, and are generally designed to help qualified veterans purchase a property, so they are definitely worth looking into if you qualify.Compare lenders: Best VA Loan LendersCompare rates: Today's VA Loan RatesUSDA loansA USDA loan is a mortgage that is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. To qualify, a home must be in an eligible rural area, and the borrower's income must be below certain limits. If both borrower and property qualify, USDA loans don't require any down payment whatsoever.It's also important to mention that in addition to these types of loans, many lenders have their own proprietary mortgage products, and some are specifically designed for first-time home buyers. For example, some lenders offer low-down-payment conventional loans with no mortgage insurance requirement. So it could also be a great idea to research the options offered by some of the best mortgage lenders as well as your local and regional financial institutions.Compare lenders: Best USDA Mortgage Lenders\n\n\n\n\nHow do I qualify as a first-time home buyer?There aren't any specific requirements that only apply to first-time buyers (unless a particular loan product has a separate credit or down payment requirement for first-timers). For the most part, first-time buyers are subject to the same general requirements that all mortgage applicants face.Having said that, first-time buyers are less likely to know what to expect than seasoned homeowners. So here are the general categories of information your mortgage lender will consider when you apply for a mortgage for your first home.CreditBefore verifying any of your other qualifications, lenders will typically run a credit check. Virtually all mortgage lenders use the FICO credit scoring model, and most will pull your scores from all three major credit bureaus and use the middle number for qualification purposes. Federal Housing Administration (or FHA) loans require a minimum 580 FICO\u00ae Score for a 3.5% down payment, while conventional loans have a minimum of 620.Down paymentUnless you're using a VA or USDA loan to finance your home, you'll need a down payment. FHA and conventional loans have low down payment options, and funds can usually come from a gift. But you'll need to document what funds you have for your down payment and where they came from, as well as how you plan to pay for any closing costs.Debt-to-income ratioSimply put, lenders want to make sure you'll be able to afford your mortgage payments, so they'll look at your debt obligations as a percentage of your income, a metric known as your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI ratio. Methods of calculating DTI and lending standards can vary, but a good rule of thumb is that your total monthly debt obligations (including your new mortgage payment) should be no more than 45% of your pre-tax income. However, there are exceptions, and borrowers have different costs of living to deal with, so if you feel you can comfortably afford to have a higher DTI ratio, don't be discouraged. In fact, FHA lenders will allow you to have a DTI as high as 57% in some cases!EmploymentLenders want to know that not only can you afford your mortgage payments for now, but that you'll also be able to keep paying your mortgage year after year. Most mortgage lenders want to see at least two years of steady employment in the same field (but not necessarily with the same employer). There are exceptions, however -- such as if you graduated from college less than two years ago.Assets\/reservesDepending on the mortgage loan you select, as well as your other qualifications, your lender is likely to require a certain amount of money in reserves. This can be as little as two months' worth of mortgage payments. The point is that you typically can't end up with a zero balance in your bank account after closing on your home and paying any closing costs.Before you apply for a mortgage, it makes sense to ensure each of these are as good as possible. For example, taking some time to raise your credit score and save a higher down payment could help you snag a better interest rate, which will save you money in the long run.Choosing the best lender for first-time home buyersThe first step in choosing the best mortgage lender for your first home purchase is to get a good understanding of how home loans work. Then you'll need to narrow down a short list of a few (say, three or four) lenders with products and resources that meet your needs and that have strong customer service. Our best first-time mortgage lender list on this page is a good place to start, but it could also be a smart idea to check out your local and regional banks or credit unions so that you can compare mortgage rates. If you're looking for a digital application process, be sure to check out our list of the best online mortgage lenders.Once you have a short list, apply for a mortgage with all of them to compare the specific loan terms and fees that you get offered. It won't hurt your credit score to do this, as all mortgage-based credit inquiries that take place within a typical shopping period are counted as just a single inquiry. You'll see a range of interest rates, fees, and APRs from different lenders, and you'd be surprised at how much this can save or cost you over the life of a 30-year mortgage loan.\n\n\n\n\nFirst-time home buyer resources9 First-Time Home Buyer TipsFirst-Time Home Buyer Benefits: Qualification and Requirements9 First-Time Home Buyer Mistakes to AvoidA First-Time Home Buyer\u2019s Guide to FHA LoansFirst-Time Home-Buyer Class: What to Know and Do You Need to Take One?How to Create a First-Time Homeowners\u2019 BudgetDown Payment Assistance: Available Programs & How to ApplyHow to Shop for a MortgageHome Buyer Checklist: Everything to Do to Buy a Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLender\nBest For\nNext Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2023 Award Winner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter\n\n\nRating image, 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 stars\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Look for the most competitive rates, loan terms, down payment requirements, and fees. Buyers should also look to see what types of loans a lender offers, who they will be working with, the average loan processing time, and customer service ratings.\n\n\n\n\nWhat programs are available for first-time home buyers?\n\n\n\nFirst-time home buyers can get loans through different programs. The federal government offers low down payment loans through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Veteran Affairs (VA), and The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). First-time home buyers can also get a low down payment conventional loan through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In addition, many states and local governments offer first-time home buyers loans. Non-profit organizations, certain employers, and other financial institutions also offer first-time home buyer loans.\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of loan can I get as a first-time home buyer?\n\n\n\nThere are many different types of loans you can get as a first-time home buyer. There are loans to assist with the down payment, down payment assistance (DPA) grants, government-backed loans, conventional loans offered through financial institutions, as well as loans through charities, non-profits, and employer-sponsored loans.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the best loans for first-time home buyers?\n\n\n\nIt depends on the buyer, but if you don't have a large down payment or you don't have an established credit history, a FHA loan could be the best way to get into your first home. FHA loans require just 3.5% down for borrowers with credit scores of 580 or higher, and have lower credit scoring requirements than any other major home loan type.\n\n\n\n\nHow much money do I have to put down as a first-time home buyer?\n\n\n\nDepending on your circumstances, you might be able to get a loan for your first home with little or no money down. USDA and VA loans both have no down payment requirement, and some banks offer their own first-time buyer loans with 0% down. FHA loans require 3.5% down for most borrowers, and it's possible for first-time buyers to get a conventional mortgage with as little as 3% down.Having said that, a higher down payment can reduce your monthly mortgage payments and, depending on your loan type can either reduce or eliminate your private mortgage insurance expense.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the easiest loan for first-time buyers to get approved for?\n\n\n\nFor most buyers, an FHA loan is the easiest to get approved for. Borrowers with 10% down payments can get approved with credit scores as low as 500, and the down payment requirement drops to 3.5% for borrowers with FICO\u00ae Scores of 580 or higher. These are the lowest credit scoring requirements for the major types of mortgages. On the other hand, if you have a high credit score or have served in the Armed Forces, a conventional or VA loan can be just as \"easy\" to get.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0Matt Frankel, CFP\u00ae\nOur Mortgages Expert","Article Date":"August 17, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"25":{"Article Title":"Best FHA Lenders of October 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/mortgages\/best-lenders-fha-loans\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

These mortgage loans have lower barriers to entry and can help you finance a home even if you don't have a high credit score or large down payment. Because the requirements aren't as strict as conventional mortgages, these loans are perfect for first-time home buyers or those with poor credit.FHA mortgages come in two different types:\u00a0FHA 203(b) loan: This is the \"standard\" FHA loan. It's designed for buying a home that is essentially move-in ready.FHA 203(k) loan: This is an FHA mortgage loan designed for purchasing homes that need significant repairs or renovations before move-in. Many of the best FHA 203(k) lenders will let you roll these costs into a monthly mortgage payment with a competitive interest rate.\u00a0One of the most important points to know about FHA loans is that they are meant only for owner-occupied properties. You can't use an FHA loan to buy a vacation home, rental, or investment property.Learn more: FHA vs. Conventional Loan\n\n\n\nHow do FHA loans work?\n\n\n\nAn FHA mortgage is a private home loan insured by the government. Because the loan amount is backed by the FHA, lenders are more willing to take on high-risk borrowers.That said, FHA does have some requirements, such as:\u00a0Down payment of at least 3.5%Credit score of at least 580 (or 500 if your down payment is 10% or more)\u00a0Debt-to-income ratio of at most 43%\u00a0Loan must be for an owner-occupied property\u00a0Two years of stable income and explanations for any gaps in employment history\u00a0\u00a0Safe, sound, and secure propertyLet's take a look at each of these in more detail.Down paymentYou need 3.5% of the purchase price as a down payment to qualify for an FHA mortgage loan (or 10% if your credit score is between 500 and 579).\u00a0 That means for every $100,000 you plan to spend on a home, you should have $3,500 to put toward a down payment.Credit scoreIn general, the minimum credit score to qualify for an FHA loan is 580. But many of the best\u00a0 FHA lenders for bad credit may allow a score as low as 500 if you can afford a down payment of 10% or more. For comparison, conventional mortgage lenders typically require credit scores of 620 or higher.\u00a0Debts and incomeGenerally speaking, many of the best FHA loan lenders look for a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of at most 43%. That means, your total monthly debt obligations (including your proposed monthly mortgage payment) should be less than 43% of your pre-tax monthly income. For example, if you're bringing in $5,000 per month (before taxes), your mortgage payment should be no more than $2,150.\u00a0That said, if you have certain \"compensating factors,\" such as a high credit score or a hefty amount of savings, lenders may issue loans for higher DTI ratios.\u00a0Employment historyTop FHA lenders typically want to see at least two years of steady employment. That doesn't mean you have to stay with the same employer for two years, nor does it require you to stay within the same line of work. As long as a lender can verify that you have two years of steady work history, you can check this box.\u00a0That said, you may still qualify if you have gaps in your work history. Typically, you just need to provide your FHA lender with a letter explaining any gaps that span a month or longer. For instance, if you graduated from college last year and have been steadily employed since then, you could still potentially qualify. Lenders just want to know that your income is likely to continue for years to come.Property standardsFHA loans can be used to purchase single-family homes, condominiums, and even multi-family properties with as many as four housing units. As long as the buyer plans to live in one of the units, the property qualifies.The home must also meet standards set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). While HUD has some specific requirements, the department just wants the home to be safe, sound, and secure, which generally means free of any hazards that could adversely affect occupants. To ensure the home meets HUD's requirements, an appraiser approved by the FHA must inspect the property.If the home needs major renovations or repairs before you move in, then you'll need to apply for a FHA 203(k) loan. The standard FHA loan -- 203(b) -- doesn't usually cover homes that need major work.\u00a0READ MORE: If you would like to learn about some of the major players in the mortgage industry, check out The Ascent's research piece on the largest mortgage lenders.\n\n\n\nAre there extra costs with an FHA loan?\n\n\n\nYes, FHA loans come with costs above what you'll pay on the mortgage. Perhaps the most significant is the FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP), which is broken down into two types: upfront and annual.\u00a0The upfront MIP is 1.75% of the loan amount. For example, if you buy a $300,000 home and put 3.5% down, your base loan amount is $289,500. The upfront MIP on this loan amount would be 1.75% of $289,500, or $5,066.25. This amount is paid only once and can be rolled into your FHA loan.\u00a0The annual MIP is a bit more complicated to calculate. It depends on the loan length, amount, and down payment. For most 15-year FHA loans, it ranges from 0.15% to 0.40% per year. For 30-year FHA loans, it's in the 0.50% to 0.55% range.\u00a0If your down payment is less than 10%, you'll pay annual MIPs for the entire length of your FHA loan. This is different from private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional loans, which can be canceled when the loan-to-value ratio drops below 80%. For those FHA borrowers who can put down 10% or more, annual MIPs can be dropped after 11 years for both 15- and 30-year loan terms.\u00a0In addition to mortgage insurance, FHA loans have closing costs, which may include:Your lender's origination feePrepaid taxes and insuranceDiscount pointsAppraisal feesThe FHA mortgage insurance premiumIf you're working with one of the best lenders for FHA mortgages, your lender should be glad to answer any questions about closing costs associated with your mortgage. Still, there are ways you can potentially lower your out-of-pocket costs, such as:\u00a0Gift money. The down payment doesn't necessarily need to be your money. All or part of your down payment can come from a down payment gift. This could help lower your monthly expenses and eventually cancel your annual MIP.\u00a0Roll in closing costs. Many FHA lenders will let you roll closing costs into the FHA loan itself, freeing your money up for other things, such as putting down a bigger down payment.\u00a0Likewise, if you need to renovate a home, the best 203(k) loan lenders will let you roll those costs into your monthly mortgage.Seller concessions. You can ask the seller to pay some or all of your closing costs (as much as 6% of the purchase price) as part of your purchase offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nHow much will my monthly mortgage payment be?\n\nUse our mortgage calculator to help you estimate your monthly mortgage payments using various loan terms, insurances, and taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there an income limit for FHA loans?\n\n\n\nNo, you don't need a minimum or maximum income to qualify for an FHA loan. But there are FHA loan limits -- that is, a maximum amount you can borrow.\u00a0In 2023, the standard FHA loan limit for a one-unit property is $472,030 for most U.S. housing markets, while certain high-cost areas could have limits as high as $1,089,300 . These figures are based on the national limit for conforming mortgages, which is currently $726,200. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sets the \"floor\" at 65% and the \"ceiling\" at 150%. Again, the current floor is 65% of $726,200 (or $472,030) and the ceiling is 150% of that figure, or $1,089,300.\u00a0\u00a0FHA loans can be made in higher amounts for a duplex, because there are more units involved. Here's a quick reference chart that can help illustrate the FHA loan limits for 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS\n\n\nBASE FHA LOAN LIMIT\n\n\nHIGH-COST FHA LOAN LIMIT\n\n\nALASKA, HAWAII, GUAM, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS FHA LOAN LIMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n$472,030\n\n\n$1,089,300\n\n\n$1,633,950\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n$604,400\n\n\n$1,394,775\n\n\n$2,092,150\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n$730,525\n\n\n$1,685,850\n\n\n$2,528,775\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n$907,900\n\n\n$2,095,200\n\n\n$3,142,800\n\n\n\n\n\nData source: HUD.\n\n\n\nIf you're curious about the FHA loan limit for a specific geographic location, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a quick and easy search tool.\n\n\n\nHow to choose the best FHA lender\n\n\n\nTo find the best lender for an FHA loan, start by getting pre-approved for a mortgage with a few lenders. Then, compare mortgage rates, terms, and fees.Mortgage ratesEach FHA mortgage company sets its own rate for the sum you borrow. Even a small difference in interest rate from one lender to another could result in big savings over the life of your repayment period, especially if you end up with a 30-year mortgage.TermsYou may want to take out a 30-year mortgage, or you may want to pay off your home in 15 years. The FHA mortgage lender you choose should be able to offer a loan term with a repayment period that works for you.FeesWhen you sign a mortgage, you pay closing costs to finalize that loan. Those fees vary from lender to lender. It's common for closing costs to amount to 2% to 6% of your loan amount. But since that's a big range, it may be that one FHA lender offers substantially lower closing costs than another.Most big lenders offer FHA loans, especially those focused on helping borrowers with poor credit. Our picks for the best FHA mortgage lenders (at the top of this page) are a good place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt pays to shop around\n\nComparing interest rates from different lenders is the best way to get the most competitive rate. Check out today's FHA mortgage rates to get started!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare FHA mortgage rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs an FHA loan right for me?\n\n\n\nIf you're looking to get a mortgage with poor credit or without a large down payment, an FHA loan could be a smart option. Use our list above as a starting point to find the best FHA lenders for bad credit.But if your credit score is above 580 or you have a relatively large down payment, you'll probably save money with a conventional mortgage.For example, if your down payment is 20% of the purchase price on a conventional loan, you can avoid paying mortgage insurance altogether. With an FHA loan, however, you would still pay annual MIP for 11 years. Even if you don't have a large down payment, borrowers with excellent credit scores might still get conventional mortgages with down payments as low as 3%. Plus, you'll find better mortgage insurance terms than with even the best lenders for FHA loans. If that's your situation, get started with our list of this month's best mortgage lenders.\n\n\n\nDo all lenders work with FHA loans?\n\n\n\nFor lenders to offer FHA loans, they must be approved by the Federal Housing Administration, which backs those loans. Many banks and lending institutions offer FHA loans, but there are some lenders that are not approved to offer them.\n\n\n\nPros and cons of FHA loans\n\n\n\nFHA loans have their benefits and drawbacks so it's important to consider both.Here's a closer look at a few pros and cons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros:Lower credit score requirementsLower down payment requirementsAvailable to first-time home buyers and repeat buyersCan buy a multi-unit property as long as you occupy one unitNo income maximums\n\n\n\n\nCons:Upfront and ongoing mortgage insurance premiumsCan't borrow for a vacation home or investment propertyMust stick to the annual loan limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLender\nBest For\nNext Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2023 Award Winner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Mortgage\n\n\nRating image, 5.0 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0 stars\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\n5 stars equals Best.\n4 stars equals Excellent.\n3 stars equals Good.\n2 stars equals Fair.\n1 star equals Poor.\n\n\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

FHA loans are made by private mortgage lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and specialized mortgage lenders, and are guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration.\n\n\n\n\nDo FHA loans require insurance?\n\n\n\nFHAs require two types of mortgage insurance premiums (MIP): annual and upfront. They don't, however, require private mortgage insurance (PMI).\n\n\n\n\nIs there a required credit score for an FHA loan?\n\n\n\nYes, the minimum FICO\u00ae Score required for an FHA loan is 580. For down payments above 10%, the minimum credit score is 500.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the best bank for an FHA loan?\n\n\n\nThe best bank for FHA loans is one that offers you a competitive mortgage rate and will pre-approve you even if your credit score isn't flawless. Many national banks have FHA mortgage programs, but you can check out credit unions to compare rates.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIs an FHA lender the same as an FHA mortgage broker?\n\n\n\nNo, they're not the same. An FHA lender is someone who will issue you an FHA loan, whereas an FHA mortgage broker is an intermediary who will connect you with FHA lenders or FHA mortgage companies.

There's a lot to learn when you start using credit cards, and a lack of knowledge can end up costing you money.This beginner's guide will cover all the credit card basics. You'll learn exactly how credit cards work, how to choose the best first credit card, and plenty of other information you'll need to know about using credit cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump To\n\n\n\nHow do credit cards work?\n\n\n\n\nWhat to look for with your first credit card\n\n\n\n\nRecommended credit cards for beginners\n\n\n\n\nIs a credit card necessary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do credit cards work?A credit card is tied to a credit account with a financial institution. When you use the card, you're borrowing money from the credit card issuer. You can use a credit card to purchase goods or services with any merchant that accepts credit cards. Some cards also let you get a cash advance, although this isn't recommended because of the high fees involved.The amount you owe on a credit card is called the balance. If you make a $100 purchase, your card's balance would increase by $100.Each credit card has a credit limit, which is the maximum amount you can owe the bank at one time. For example, if your card's credit limit is $1,000, then the balance can't exceed that amount.LEARN MORE: What Is the Average Credit Card Limit?The difference between your credit limit and your balance is known as your available credit. Continuing the example above, if your card has a $1,000 credit limit and a $100 balance, the available credit would be $900.After you make a payment, you have more available credit to borrow again. For that reason, a credit card is considered a revolving line of credit. You can keep using it and borrowing from it, as long as you pay your bill and have credit available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n;\n\n\n\nWhat is APR?APR, which stands for annual percentage rate, is the annual cost of borrowing money with a credit card. It's the interest rate the card issuer charges on any outstanding balance after your payment due date.Fortunately, you can avoid interest charges by paying off your card's full statement balance. If you do that, you won't need to pay any interest on purchases you make.LEARN MORE: What Is APR and What Does It Mean for Your Credit Cards?Here's an example of how APR works:Your credit card has an APR of 20%.You have a balance of $1,000.If you leave that balance on the card and don't incur any fees, then it would grow to $1,200 after one year. (20% of $1,000 = $200, added to the amount you owed originally)If you pay off the full $1,000 balance by the due date, there won't be any interest charges.In reality, you couldn't leave that balance for a whole year. You'd need to make minimum payments every month to keep your account in good standing and avoid fees. That was just an example to explain the concept of credit card interest.LEARN MORE: How Does Credit Card Interest Work?\n\n\n\n\nHow to build creditAfter you're approved for a credit card, it's important to use the card in a way that will improve your credit score. Here's what you need to do to build credit with a credit card.Pay on timeThe best thing you can do for your credit is to always pay on time. Your payment history is the most significant factor in determining your credit score, and on-time payments will help you get excellent credit.Most credit card issuers offer an autopay feature. This is a good way to ensure you never miss a payment. Alternatively, you can set a monthly reminder for yourself.Watch your FICO\u00ae ScoreAlthough there are multiple types of credit scores, the FICO\u00ae Score is the one that lenders use most often. You should check yours at least once every few months to ensure you're headed in the right direction. Some credit cards include a FICO\u00ae Score tracker, but if yours doesn't, there are also free ways to check your score online.LEARN MORE: How to Find Out Your Credit ScoreKeep your balances lowIt's bad for your credit score if your credit card balance gets too high. Try to always stay below 30% of your credit limit to avoid a drop in your credit score. You can calculate this by multiplying your card's credit limit by 30%. For example, if your card has a $1,000 credit limit, aim to keep the balance below $300.LEARN MORE: How Much Available Credit Should I Have?Ask for a credit limit increaseAfter nine to 12 months of using your card and making on-time payments, ask the card issuer for a credit limit increase. A higher credit limit can make it easier to keep your balances below the recommended 30% ratio.LEARN MORE: How to Increase Your Credit LimitKeep your account openOne factor that affects your credit score is your average account age. It's recommended to keep older accounts around to help boost your credit score. Try not to close your first credit card, in particular, since that will be your oldest credit account.LEARN MORE: Should You Close an Unused Credit Card?Apply for new cards sparinglyAs you build your credit, you'll start to become eligible for credit cards with more benefits. There's nothing wrong with opening a new card that could save you money, but be careful not to overdo it.Each time you apply for a credit card, it has a small impact on your credit score. Too many applications can make it difficult to continue improving your credit. Apply for a new card once every year or once every six months at most so your credit score keeps going up.LEARN MORE: Does Applying for a Credit Card Hurt Your Credit Score?What should I look for in a first credit card?Beginner credit cards usually come with features or perks that are designed for new users. Here are a few features to look for when choosing the best first credit card.\n\n\n\n\nNo annual feeIdeally, your first credit card is one that you'll want to keep open forever, helping you extend the age of your credit history with each passing month. We think the best first credit card is one that doesn't have an annual fee, so you won't have to pay every year just to keep it open.LEARN MORE: Best No Annual Fee Credit CardsFree FICO\u00ae Score trackerSome credit cards offer free access to your FICO\u00ae Score. This allows you to keep an eye on your score from your online credit card account.No or low security depositSecured credit cards are popular for those who are new to credit. To get this type of card, you pay a refundable security deposit. Because the credit card issuer is getting a deposit upfront, it can be more flexible about whom it approves.LEARN MORE: What Is a Secured Credit Card?Secured cards aren't your only option, so it's worth looking at unsecured cards, as well. That way, you may be able to avoid paying a deposit. If you go with a secured card, look for one with an affordable deposit amount. Cards that offer a $200 credit limit in exchange for a deposit of $200 or less are ideal.COMPARE TOP PICKS: Best Secured Credit CardsRewardsRewards aren't a make-or-break feature, since the primary purpose of a beginner card is to help you build a credit score and qualify for better terms on loans and cards later. That said, if you can score rewards from your first credit card, it's certainly not a bad feature to have.LEARN MORE: Best Rewards Credit CardsBEGINNER'S GUIDE: Are credit cards bad?

A limited credit history can affect your life in many ways. The most obvious is that you'll have trouble getting approved by lenders if you ever want to borrow money. In addition, it can lead to you getting rejected when trying to rent a home, and in many states, it can even result in higher car insurance rates.Security: Credit cards are the best payment method from a security perspective. If a thief makes fraudulent charges with your credit card, you can contact the card issuer to get the charges removed and receive a new card. The most you can legally be liable for with credit card fraud is $50. And most card issuers even have zero-liability policies, which means you won't be liable for fraudulent charges at all.Rewards: Many of the best credit cards offer cash back, travel points, or some other form of rewards. This allows you to earn value back on the money you spend.Credit cards vs. debit cardsSince credit cards and debit cards look alike, it's easy to get them confused. To help you tell them apart, we'll take a closer look at their similarities and differences.SimilaritiesCredit cards and debit cards are both physical cards that are tied to a financial account. You can use each type of card to pay for goods or services. The ways you use them for transactions are also the same. For physical transactions, the most common option is to insert your card, swipe it in a card reader, or make a contactless payment. For online transactions, you enter your card information.DifferencesAlthough both types of cards are tied to financial accounts, the accounts they are tied to are different. A credit card is tied to a revolving line of credit that a bank has issued you. A debit card is tied to your bank account.This is an important distinction. With a credit card transaction, the card issuer pays, and you pay them back later. With a debit card transaction, you pay using funds from your bank account. If you have a fraudulent charge on your credit card, you can call and have that charge removed, and you won't be out any money. If you're a victim of debit card fraud, the bank may need to investigate before it can put the money back into your account.Because of that difference, it can be easier to deal with credit card fraud. The money never leaves your bank account, like it does with debit card fraud.Credit scoreCredit cards affect your credit score, but debit cards do not. When you use your credit card and pay the bill on time, your credit will improve. Paying by debit card does not benefit your credit score in any way.Secured credit cardsSecured credit cards are a type of credit card that require a security deposit. They're typically chosen by consumers with bad or limited credit histories who can't get approved for unsecured credit cards.Although you need to deposit money to get a secured credit card, it's considered a credit card and not a debit card. You're still borrowing money from the credit card company. The deposit is simply collateral. That also means a secured card can help you improve your credit just like any other credit card.If you want to start building your credit score using a secured credit card, check out our roundup of the best secured credit cards.Important credit card termsCredit card: A physical card that's connected to a credit account. The card can be used to make purchases through that credit account.Unsecured credit card: A credit card that doesn't require any security deposit from the cardholder. Most credit cards are unsecured.Secured credit card: A credit card that requires a security deposit when the cardholder opens the account.Cash advance: Using a credit card to get cash. Cash advances typically have higher APRs and start accruing interest immediately, so they're not recommended.Balance transfer: Transferring a balance from one credit card to another, most often because one card has a lower APR. Not all credit cards offer balance transfers.Credit limit: The maximum balance a credit card can have. Many credit cards have different limits for cash advances. For example, a card could have a credit limit of $10,000, but a cash advance limit of $3,000. That means of the $10,000 credit limit, up to $3,000 could be used for a cash advance.Available credit: The difference between a card's credit limit and its available credit. If you have a $400 balance on a card with a $1,000 credit limit, then its current available credit is $600.Revolving line of credit: A line of credit that you can use and reuse, up to the credit limit, as long as the account is open. When you make payments, it frees up more available credit for you to use again.APR: The annual percentage rate, which is the annual cost of borrowing money.Minimum payment: The minimum amount you need to pay on your credit card by the due date. If you don't pay at least this much, the card issuer can charge you a late fee.Statement balance: The credit card's balance on your most recent statement closing date. By paying this amount in full every billing cycle, you can avoid interest charges on purchases you make.Credit score: A number that rates your creditworthiness, or the likeliness that you'll repay what you borrow.Still have questions?Here are some other questions we've answered:What Is a Credit Card?How Your Income Affects Credit Card ApplicationsHow to Read Your Credit Card StatementWhat Is a Bank?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a credit card\n\nDon't you wish you could take a peek inside a credit card expert's wallet sometimes?

How do you compare banks, or know what savings account is the best savings account?This guide can help you understand banks and credit unions, types of bank accounts, what to look for in a bank account, how to compare banks, and how to open a bank account and fund your account.\n\n\n\nJump to a section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a bank?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to choose a bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank account types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening an account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a bank?\nHow to choose a bank\nBank account types\nOpening an account\n\n\n\n\n\nBank vs. credit union vs. online bank\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a financial institution, the three most common options are banks, credit unions, and online banks. They each offer unique benefits that cater to different needs. Here are the main differences.What is a bank?\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: A bank is an institution where anyone (approved by the bank) can deposit savings and take out loans. Banks are often seen as a convenient and secure way to store money, and some account types also earn interest. Most banks have both online and in-person services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of banks:Bank of AmericaCapital OneKeyBankTD BankUSAABank pros:FDIC insuranceIn-person customer serviceLarge network of ATM locations and branchesOnline tools and appsMany options for accounts and financial servicesBank cons:Fees are often higher than other financial institutionsLoans often have higher interest ratesLack of flexibility and can limit customers' access to moneyDeposit accounts (like savings) don't usually earn much interestBanks are for-profit organizations. At a bank, you can open checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, or other products. Almost anyone can join a bank.However, banks often charge higher fees than credit unions. They also usually offer lower interest rates on checking and savings accounts.Learn more about banksHere are a few lists we've made to help you compare banks -- whether you're looking for account bonuses, joint accounts, or something else:Best national banksBest banks for joint accountsBest banks for college students\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an online bank?Definition: An online bank is a financial institution that takes deposits and makes loans online, without any physical branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of online banks:AllyAxos BankEverBankQuonticVio BankOnline bank pros:FDIC insuranceConvenience and account access at any time and anywhere.Fees are lowerLoans have lower interest ratesDeposit accounts (like savings) earn more interestOnline bank cons:No in-person customer serviceTaking out cash can be a hassleSecurity concernsOnline banking has become increasingly popular in recent years, allowing customers to manage their finances from the comfort of their own home. Online banks are for-profit. They're similar to other banks, except they don't have any in-person locations. If you need help, you must contact the online bank by phone or email.People generally like these banks because they offer high interest rates on bank accounts and low interest rates on loans. Another advantage of online banking is the convenience it provides. Customers can access their account at any time, anywhere, and complete transactions quickly and easily.The biggest drawback of online banks is that accessing your funds can be more difficult. Some banks have ATM networks where you can withdraw cash for free. However, if you don't live near a connected ATM, it can be a hassle to withdraw cash from an online bank account.It's normal to have a lot of questions about opening an online bank account. Online banks are new, and a lot of people have never opened an account with an online bank before. Here are some resources we've created to help you decide if an online bank account is for you:Are online banks safe?Pros and cons of online banksWe've also reviewed many popular online checking accounts, and created a list to help you compare. You can find that list here: Best online checking accounts.\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a credit union?Definition: A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that exists to serve its members. Unlike banks, credit unions are owned and operated by their members, with a focus on providing affordable financial products and services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit union pros:NCUA insuranceIn-person customer serviceFees are usually lower than other financial institutionsLoans generally have lower interest ratesDeposit accounts (like savings) usually earn more interestSometimes more lenient towards borrowers with bad creditCredit union cons:Generally fewer online and mobile toolsMembership may be limited to those who qualifyFewer options for accountsNetworks of ATMs and physical branches can be limitedCredit unions are not-for-profit. The biggest advantage of using a credit union is that they typically offer better interest rates on loans, credit cards, savings accounts, and CDs, compared to traditional banks. However, they also tend to have fewer product offerings. Plus, not everyone can become a member of a credit union.Each credit union defines its membership differently. To become a member of a credit union, you might need to pay a small membership fee or be part of an organization (like the military).If you're comparing banks vs. credit unions, an important first question is \"Can I become a member of the credit union I'm interested in joining?\"\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the best bank?\n\n\n\nThat depends on who you are and what you need!For a quick look at the banks we love, click a button below.

Then, ask the following questions. The more times you answer \"Yes\" to these questions about a bank you like, the more likely that bank fits your lifestyle:Does it have FDIC or NCUA insurance? This keeps your money safe if the bank or credit union fails.Is it convenient for you? This can mean a good location or a even good mobile app.Does it have good customer service? Look at online reviews, as well as hours for the bank's call center and online chat services.Does it offer other financial products you need, like mortgages or small business accounts?Answering these questions should help you find the right bank for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're curious about any of the questions above, keep reading --we'll dig into the details of each one by one below:FDIC insurance or NCUA insuranceWhat is FDIC insurance, you ask? It's a guarantee that the bank will have some or all of your money available for you to withdraw (within account requirements and limitations) -- even if the bank itself fails.You'll probably never need FDIC or NCUA insurance, but if you do, you'll really need it. Make sure that your bank or credit union is FDIC insured before you sign up. Most state their member ID number on the footer of their website. You can also contact the bank or credit union if you're unsure, but most should have the applicable type of insurance.Availability and convenienceTo find the right financial institution for you, check where and how you can access your account. If you prefer banking in person, check whether the bank you're interested in has branches near you (or nationwide, if that fits your lifestyle).Most banks offer some online functionality these days, and some banks are fully online. But it's worth checking out a bank's mobile banking app (if it has one) to see how much of your banking you can do from your phone or other device. This could be especially helpful if you're opening a joint account with someone who doesn't live near you.Customer serviceLook into how you can contact the bank or credit union if you have questions or problems with your account. Check into its customer service hours as well. Some national banks have 24\/7 customer support, while smaller regional banks and credit unions may only operate during normal business hours.Mortgages, loans, and other banking productsYou may only be looking for a checking or savings account now, but in the future you might need to buy a home or start a business and then you'll need a mortgage or a business loan. Anticipating your future needs and choosing a bank or credit union that can accommodate them can prevent you from having to jump ship as your financial needs change.\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the best bank account?\n\n\n\nOnce you've narrowed your list down to a couple banks, take a look at their accounts and ask the following questions.Would it be free for you to use ATMs? Look for banks with a large ATM network, or accounts that offer ATM fee reimbursement for out-of-network ATMs.Do any accounts have a high interest rate (APY)? This is how much money you'll earn in interest.Do the accounts have low fees? To see all the fees associated with an account, you can ask for something called a \"fee schedule.\"Do the accounts have minimum balances you can maintain?Do any of the accounts offer an attractive sign-up bonus?Need a place to start? Here's a few places you can find our favorite bank accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Savings Accounts\n\n\nBest Checking Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep reading for more information on how to compare different accounts:ATM network or generous ATM fee reimbursement programYou want your bank to be as accessible as possible. If you often pay with cash, you will need access to in-network ATMs to avoid any ATM fees. If you only have access to out-of-network ATMs, look for banks that offer generous ATM fee reimbursements. Most banks boast how many ATMs you can use for free on their websites, and they'll also post what fees, if any, you might incur when using an ATM.Bank interest ratesLook at the APYs your bank or credit union offers on the type of account you're interested in, and compare this to some of its competitors.Note that some financial institutions employ a tiered system where you earn a higher interest rate for having a larger balance. If this is the case, figure out what kind of interest rate you can realistically expect based on how much you plan to keep in the account.You should also look into how its interest rates on loans stack up against competitors if you think you might ever take out a loan from the bank or credit union.FeesCheck the fee schedule for the type of account you plan to open. Contact the bank or credit union if you are unable to find this information on its website or if you have any questions about its fees. Read through it all carefully and make sure you understand what you're getting into. Common fees to watch for include: monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, out-of-network ATM fees, insufficient funds fees, and more.Minimum balance requirementMany banks and credit unions require a minimum initial deposit to open your account. They may have ongoing minimum balance requirements you must meet to avoid fees. Like almost everything on this list, requirements will vary by institution and account type. Make sure you're comfortable with these before you sign up or you could cost yourself money.Account sign-up bonusesAn increasing number of banks and credit unions are offering special sign-up bonuses like credit cards do to entice new customers. This could be the deciding factor between two similar bank accounts, but don't base your decision on a sign-up bonus alone.If you're interested in accounts with bonuses, head over to our Best Bank Bonuses page.\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\nTypes of bank accounts\n\n\n\nThere are four main types of bank accounts: checking accounts, savings accounts, CDs, and MMAs.

You can withdraw money as often as you like, as long as you don't withdraw more money than you have.

There are so many options -- it can be hard to narrow down to just one! On top of making sure any account you choose is FDIC-insured, we recommend asking yourself these three questions when comparing checking accounts:What are the account fees? (Fewer is better)Is there a minimum deposit or balance?Does the account earn interest?These three questions can help you get a better idea of how the checking account will fit into your everyday life.Our recommendations: Checking accounts we loveWe spent some time (okay, a lot of time) looking at what's on the market for checking accounts.

Promotional terms and conditions are subject to change or removal without notice. Bonus cash may be taxable and reported on IRS Form 1099-MISC. Consult your tax advisor. After meeting the initial requirements mentioned above, the amount of cash bonus earned will depend on meeting the additional requirements outlined below:To earn up to a $300 bonus, you must be approved for your new Axos Bank Rewards Checking account, fund it within 30 days of account opening, and have qualifying direct deposits that total at least $5,000.00 each calendar month during the first seven (7) calendar months your account is open as well as maintain a minimum average daily balance of $7,000. The minimum balance must be achieved and maintained through the first seven (7) calendar months your account is open including the month in which your account was opened. A cash bonus of up to $300 can be earned in the following manner during the first seven (7) statement cycles. A statement cycle is a calendar month consisting of the days your account was open during that month. A maximum of six (6) payouts of $50 for each calendar month that the Rewards Checking account is receiving the direct deposit and maintain a minimum average daily balance of $7,000 can be earned during the seven (7) statement cycles, and the bonus will be deposited into your Axos Bank Rewards Checking account within 10 business days following the end of the statement cycle in which the direct deposit requirement was met. Your Axos Bank Rewards Checking account must be open and in good standing at the time the bonus is paid to be eligible to receive the bonus, and your Axos Bank Rewards Checking account must remain open for 210 days, or an early closure fee of up to $300 may apply, equal to the amount of the total bonus earned up to $300.A direct deposit is an electronic deposit of your paycheck or government benefits, such as Social Security, Disability etc. Other deposits (i.e., online banking transfers, ATM and mobile check deposits, etc.) or person-to-person payments are not considered a direct deposit.A statement cycle is defined as a period of time that starts on the first day of the calendar month and ends on the last day of the calendar month.\n\n\n\n* Quontic High Interest Checking\n\n10 debit card point of sale transactions of $10 or more per statement cycle required to earn the maximum APY.

You can also purchase checks for your checking account if you prefer to pay this way.This account differs from other banking accounts in that it generally has lower interest rates, but provides the account holder with more flexibility in terms of accessing funds.While some online checking accounts offer interest, these accounts are rare, and even the best interest-bearing checking accounts usually have annual percentage yields (APYs) lower than most savings account APYs. If you're hoping to grow your money, you're better off using one of the other bank accounts listed below.Some checking accounts charge a monthly maintenance fee, but they might waive this if you meet certain requirements, like having a certain number of deposits per month or maintaining a minimum balance. Other fees you might run into with checking accounts are ATM fees for using ATMs outside of your bank or credit union's network or overdraft fees if you try to withdraw more money from your checking account than it contains.\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\nSavings accountsBest for: Those who want a low-risk way to grow their money.Not for: Those who plan to withdraw money frequently from their account.A savings account is a low-risk account where you can earn interest on your money. It's a great place to save for an emergency fund, a vacation, or a down payment on a home. However, you can only withdraw money from a savings account account a handful of times every month -- so it's not great for paying bills. Checking accounts are better for bills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Savings Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for a savings account can be time-consuming and overwhelming. To narrow down your options, ask these three key questions when searching for the best savings account:What's the interest rate? (Higher is better)Is there a minimum deposit or balance?Does the account offer a sign-up bonus?Also make sure any savings account you're considering is FDIC-insured (that makes sure your money is protected in case of bank failure, up to $250,000).Our recommendations: Savings accounts we loveWe're a little obsessed with finance (okay, a lot obsessed).

There are different types of savings accounts available, each with their own features and benefits.The average savings account APY is 0.42%, but some high-yield savings accounts offer APYs in excess of 5%. A higher APY will help your savings grow more quickly.While you can technically keep the money in your savings account indefinitely, savings accounts are best for money you plan to use in the next three to five years. Invest longer-term savings if you hope to beat inflation and actually increase your wealth over time.A savings account isn't the best choice if you expect to withdraw cash from your accounts often. That's because it's subject to Regulation D. This is a federal law that restricts savings account holders to six \"convenient\" withdrawals or transfers per month.READ MORE: What Is Regulation D?Convenient transactions include transfers made online or over the phone, bill payments or other recurring transfers, and overdraft transfers. If you have more than six of these per month, your bank or credit union will charge you extra fees.You can still make additional \"inconvenient\" withdrawals, though, including visiting a branch location if your financial institution has them or requesting a mailed check from your bank.This is partly because banks and credit unions take the money you place into your savings account and use it to finance loans for other customers. Then, they give you a portion of the interest they earn from the borrower.Savings accounts don't usually include checks or debit cards for accessing funds. You may need to transfer funds to a checking account before you can withdraw the money via check or debit card payment. You also need to be mindful of the account's minimum balance requirement. If it has one and you let your balance fall below that level, you might incur additional fees.Below are some examples of savings accounts.

MMAs often come with checks or debit cards, like a checking account. They also have high interest rates -- like savings accounts. However, they usually have high minimum balances. You'll have to be able to keep a hefty chunk of cash in the bank at all times if you want to have an MMA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Money Market Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's lots of MMAs on the market. If you're looking for the best money market account for the first time, it can be hard to know what to compare. Here are three things we recommend comparing between money market accounts when looking for one that fits you:What's the interest rate? (Higher is better)What's the minimum balance?What are the fees on the account?Also make sure you look for an account that's FDIC-insured -- that makes sure your money is protected, up to $250,000.Our recommendations: Money market accounts we loveWe spend our days looking at bank accounts (and their close relatives -- credit cards, mortgages, and others).

The average national rate is 0.63%, but in some cases they're in excess of 5%. Money market accounts can be a wise choice if you hope to grow your money more quickly without tying it up in a CD for years at a time. But that's not to say they're without restrictions.Money market accounts are also subject to Regulation D, like savings accounts, so you're limited to six online or phone transfers and withdrawals per month. Checks also count toward your six convenient withdrawals per month, but ATM withdrawals do not. The interest rate on a money market account is variable, which means it can fluctuate over time.If a money market sounds like the right account for you, check out our list of the best money market accounts.\n\n\nShow More [ + ]\nShow Less [ - ]\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificates of deposit (CDs)Best for: Those who want to earn a higher interest rate on their savings and don't need to spend that money anytime soon.Not for: Those who think they'll need to withdraw their money before the CD's maturity date.A certificate of deposit (CD), also known as a share certificate if you're using a credit union, is a special type of savings account that offers a higher interest rate -- but there's a catch. When you put the money into a CD, you're agreeing that you won't touch it for the length of the CD term. This can be anywhere from a few months to several years. Usually, the longer the loan term, the higher the interest rate. The best CDs can offer APYs of around 5%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest CD Rates\n\n\nBest 6-Month CD Rates\n\n\nBest 1-Year CD Rates\n\n\nBest 2-Year CD Rates\n\n\nBest 3-Year CD Rates\n\n\nBest 4-Year CD Rates\n\n\nBest 5-Year CD Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're looking at CDs, there are a few important factors to keep an eye out for. Picking the right CD is important because you have to commit to it for a period of months or years. You're not married to it, but you're definitely at the \"moving in together\" stage of bank accounts.That said, here are the three things we look for when looking at certificates of deposit:What's the interest rate (APY)? (Higher is better)What's the minimum deposit to open the account?What's the term?It's also important to make sure any CD you're considering is FDIC-insured. This ensures your money is protected (up to $250,000) if the bank fails.Our recommendations: CDs we loveIf you know any of us in person, you know we like to talk about finances even when we're not working. That said, here are some of the CDs the team at the Ascent would recommend to friends and family. For the full list of our current recommendations, head to our main page: Best CD Rates.Western Alliance Bank, 1 Year: 5.51% APYQuontic CDs, 6 Months: 5.05% APYDiscover High Yield CD, 1.5 Year: 5.00% APYBarclays Online CD, 1 Year: 5.15% APY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about certificates of depositCDs are best for people who want to earn a higher return on their savings without taking on a lot of risk. They are ideal for those who have a lump sum of money that they don't need to use immediately, as the longer the term of the CD, the higher the interest rate and return.You can withdraw money from your account before it reaches its maturity date (the end of the CD term), but you'll pay a high penalty. This is often a certain number of months' worth of interest, and the farther away you are from your maturity date, the greater the penalty. A few CDs, known as no-penalty CDs, do not charge you if you withdraw your money early, but these usually have lower APYs than other types of CDs.CD laddering is a popular strategy that lets you take advantage of the higher APYs offered by longer-term CDs while still giving you access to some of your funds every year. You start by investing your money into CDs with consecutive annual maturities -- for example, a one-year, a two-year, a three-year, a four-year, and a five-year CD.When the one-year CD matures, you roll those funds into a new five-year CD. The next year, the two-year CD will mature and you put this into a new five-year CD as well, and so on. Every year, another CD will mature and you can withdraw the money if you decide or put it into a new one to keep growing your money.Looking for a CD?

Credit unions, on the other hand, are not-for-profit institutions that are owned by their members and offer a more personal touch. Online banks have emerged in recent years as an alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar banks and provide the convenience of banking from anywhere, anytime.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a checking account and savings account?\n\n\n\nWhile both types of accounts are offered by banks, they serve very different purposes. A checking account is primarily used for everyday transactions, such as paying bills, writing checks, and withdrawing cash. On the other hand, a savings account is designed to help you save money over time, and these often offer higher interest rates than checking accounts.\n\n\n\n\nAre online-only banks safe?\n\n\n\nOnline-only banks have been growing in popularity due to their convenience and competitive interest rates. Online-only banks are required to meet the same safety regulations and standards as traditional banks, including having FDIC insurance for up to $250,000 per depositor. Additionally, online-only banks are often equipped with advanced security measures, such as two-factor authentication and biometric identification, to protect against fraudulent activities.\n\n\n\n\nAre credit unions FDIC insured?\n\n\n\nNo -- but that doesn't mean you're not protected. Rather than being backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, credit unions are insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). This means they offer the same level of financial protection and security as traditional banks.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I know my financial institution is safe?\n\n\n\nWith the recent failures of regional banks, it's natural to feel concerned about the safety of your own bank. However, there are ways to ease your worries and ensure your money is secure. First, check if your bank or credit union is insured by the FDIC or NCUA. This guarantees up to $250,000 of your deposits are protected, even if your financial institution were to fail. Additionally, research your financial institution's financial health, such as its liquidity and investment portfolio. Reliable sources such as Moody's or Fitch can provide insight into a bank's stability. It's also important to keep an eye on any news regarding your bank.","Article Anthor":"By:\u00a0The Ascent Staff\n and\u00a0David Chang, ChFC\u00ae, CLU\u00ae\nOur Banking Experts","Article Date":"September 20, 2023","Label":"Perspnal Finance","Article Source":"Motley"},"29":{"Article Title":"Beginner's Guide to Mortgages","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/mortgages\/beginners-guide-home-loans\/","Article Content":"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

When you sign a mortgage, your lender agrees to loan you, the borrower, a certain amount of money so you can buy your home. You, in turn, agree to repay that amount, in monthly installments, over a preset period of time -- usually 15 or 30 years. Keep in mind that some people use the terms \"home loan\" and \"mortgage\" interchangeably.\n\n\n\nWhat is included in your monthly mortgage payment?\n\n\n\nYour monthly mortgage payment is determined by taking the principal amount of your loan -- the sum your lender lets you borrow -- and then applying the interest rate your loan calls for to that sum and spreading what you owe out over your loan's repayment period. Generally, you can choose between a 15-year or a 30-year repayment period. With the former, you'll pay less interest over the life of your home loan, but your monthly payments will be higher. Use our mortgage calculator to see what your mortgage payment may be.Sometimes you'll owe more than just principal and interest on a monthly basis, though. This is because your mortgage lender will take charge of paying your quarterly property taxes and annual homeowners insurance premiums. In that case, you'll pay your lender additional money each month that goes into an escrow account. Your lender will then dip into that account as your property tax payments and homeowners insurance premiums come due.Property taxes are the taxes you pay to your local municipality when you own a home, and homeowners insurance protects you from financial losses when your home sustains damage, or someone gets injured on your property. Property taxes are unavoidable, and while it's technically possible to own property without having homeowners insurance, mortgage lenders generally won't give out a home loan if you don't buy a homeowners policy. It's a good idea to determine how much home insurance you need before shopping around.In the early stages of your mortgage repayment period, more of your money will go toward your loan's interest portion, and less toward its principal. But as time goes on, you'll eventually pay more principal than interest. The process by which this happens is called amortization.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a promissory note?\n\n\n\nA promissory note is a secondary agreement that gets signed in conjunction with a mortgage. In it, you pledge to repay your home loan, plus interest, as per your lender's repayment schedule.\n\n\n\nWhat is a second mortgage?\n\n\n\nYour initial mortgage is a home loan that makes the purchase of your property possible. A second mortgage, on the other hand, lets you borrow against the value of your home once you're living in it.Second mortgages can come in the form of a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. Equity refers to the percentage of your home you actually own outright, and it's calculated by taking your property's market value and subtracting your outstanding mortgage balance. If your home is worth $200,000, and you owe $150,000 on your mortgage, you have $50,000 worth of equity, which you can borrow against.With a home equity loan, you borrow a lump sum of money and pay it back, at a preset interest rate, over time.With a home equity line of credit, you're granted a specified amount of money you can borrow from during a certain period of time. You don't need to borrow the entire sum at once; you can borrow some money one year, and borrow more money the next year as the need arises.You can take out a second mortgage to make home improvements or repairs to your property, but that money isn't limited to home-related spending; you can borrow it for any purpose. By contrast, your regular mortgage can only be used to buy a home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Calculator: How Much House Can I Afford?\n\n\n\n\nTarget Monthly Payment\n\n\n\nCircle with letter I in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter an amount you can comfortably afford monthly.

Standard loans can take on different forms -- personal loans and business loans are two common examples. In these situations, you're getting a loan either based on your credit score (more on that later), or based on financial need in the case of federal loans for education.Mortgages, meanwhile, are loans specifically designed to enable you to buy a home. While your credit score does play a role in helping you qualify, as is the case with regular loans, one key difference is that mortgages use your home as collateral.When you take out a regular loan, there's no specific asset your lender can come after to recoup its money if you don't make your payments. Mortgages, however, are secured loans, and if you don't pay yours back, your home is the asset that's used as collateral. That means your lender can force the sale of your home via foreclosure and use the proceeds from that sale to get repaid.\n\n\n\nApplying for a home loan\n\n\n\nSecuring a mortgage can be a time-consuming process, but it doesn't have to be a daunting one. The first step involves researching lenders to see which are offering the best mortgage rates. The interest rate you pay on your mortgage will determine what that loan costs you over time. The better your credit, the more likely you'll be to snag the most competitive rate a given lender is offering.Mortgage rates are either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed mortgage, you'll pay the same interest rate over the life of your loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, that rate can vary over time, so you may start out paying very little interest but then see that rate climb down the line. In some cases, the rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage can go down over time, too. But if you want the security of knowing what rate you'll be paying throughout the life of your loan, then a fixed-rate mortgage is the way to go.\n\n\n\nThings you'll need to secure a mortgage\n\n\n\nLenders don't give out mortgages easily. To get one, you'll need:Decent creditA low debt-to-income ratioA down paymentCredit scores range from 300 to 850, and a score of 670 or above is considered good. You may qualify for a mortgage with a lower credit score, but if you do, you probably won't snag a favorable rate on your home loan. If your credit score isn't great, it pays to work on boosting it before securing a mortgage. You can do so by paying incoming bills on time and paying off a chunk of your existing debt.Your debt-to-income ratio, meanwhile, measures the amount of money you owe each month on existing debts relative to your monthly earnings. If you owe too much, mortgage lenders will be less inclined to loan you money, so ideally, you'll want a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or lower. This means that if you bring home $3,000 a month, you shouldn't have more than $1,080 in existing monthly debts. If that ratio of yours isn't favorable, work on paying off existing debt.Finally, you'll need to put some money toward the purchase of your home, the amount of which will depend on the type of mortgage you get. Generally speaking, you'll need a 20% down payment when you take out a conventional loan to avoid private mortgage insurance, or PMI. PMI is a premium designed to protect your lender in the event you're unable to keep up with your mortgage payments. It usually gets tacked on to your monthly mortgage payment and equals 0.5% to 1% of the amount of your mortgage. For example, with a $150,000 mortgage, you'll generally be looking at $750 to $1,500 in PMI annually, spread out over 12 months.For more on the paperwork you'll need to apply, read our guide on what documentation you need to apply for a mortgage.\n\n\n\nWhat are closing costs on a mortgage?\n\n\n\nWhen you finalize a mortgage, you're liable for a host of fees, known as closing costs. Closing costs typically equal 2% to 5% of your mortgage's value. You can pay your closing costs as a one-time expense, or you can often roll them into your mortgage and pay them off over time (with interest). Your lender is required to give you an estimate of your closing costs ahead of time so you're not caught off-guard.\n\n\n\nTypes of mortgage loans\n\n\n\nNot all mortgages are created equal. Here are the different types of mortgages you should know about:Conventional mortgagesConventional home loans adhere to the maximum limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the agencies that back most U.S. mortgages. As mentioned, you'll pay PMI if you fail to put down 20% on a conventional mortgage, but you may be able to put down as little as 3%. The borrowing limits for conventional mortgages change from year to year. In most of the U.S., the maximum conforming mortgage for one-unit properties is $510,400 in 2020.FHA loansThese mortgages are backed by the Federal Housing Administration and are geared toward applicants who don't have great credit or don't have the funds for a substantial down payment. You can put as little as 3.5% down with an FHA loan if you have a 580 credit score or above. But, you pay certain premiums with an FHA loan (similar to PMI) that can make your mortgage more expensive.VA loansThese mortgages are available to active members of the U.S. military as well as veterans. VA loans don't require a down payment and don't charge PMI. There are, however, funding fees involved that get tacked onto your mortgage costs.USDA loansBacked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA loans help lower-income borrowers buy homes in rural areas. If you qualify, you won't have to make a down payment on your home, but that home must be located in a designated zone (buying in a suburb alone does not guarantee that you'll qualify).Jumbo mortgagesThese are conventional mortgages that exceed the maximum borrowing limits. Jumbo mortgages are harder to qualify for than conventional mortgages, and you'll generally need at least a 10% down payment, if not 20%.\n\n\n\nRefinancing a mortgage\n\n\n\nThe mortgage rate you lock in initially doesn't have to be the rate you get stuck with for life. If you refinance your mortgage, you may manage to secure a lower interest rate on your home loan, thereby lowering your monthly payments.Refinancing means swapping one loan for another, and you can do it for many types of loans -- not just a mortgage. The refinancing process is similar to that of applying for an initial home loan -- you shop around for the best rates and then compare the terms different lenders are offering with the terms of your existing loan to see if refinancing makes sense.It often pays to refinance your mortgage if your credit score has improved a lot since you first applied for a home loan. If it has, then you may be eligible for a much lower interest rate than what you're paying right now. It also makes sense to refinance if you want to change the terms of your mortgage -- for example, if you can't keep up with your monthly payments under a 15-year loan, you may want to refinance to a loan with a 30-year term. Or, you may want to do the opposite -- switch from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage.If you're going to refinance, make sure you're planning to stay in your home long enough to recoup the closing costs involved. If you pay $1,800 in closing costs but your refinance enables you to save $120 a month on your monthly mortgage payments, then you'll break even in 15 months. If you plan to stay in your home longer than that, then refinancing makes sense, but if you think there's a good chance you'll move in a year, then you may want to stick with your original home loan.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line on mortgages\n\n\n\nApplying for a mortgage for the first time can be stressful if you don't know what you're getting into.
