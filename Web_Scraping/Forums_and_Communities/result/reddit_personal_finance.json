My grieving MIL wants to pay off her 1.8% mortgage with a life insurance payout after her husband passed : r/personalfinance", "date": "2023-09-28 18:05:16.643000+00:00", "content": "My husband\u2019s father passed away fairly suddenly a few weeks ago, and in addition to grieving, he has been helping his mother untangle all of the financial complications that came along with his dad passing. They had a VERY traditional, conservative marriage, and my father in law handled all of the money matters.\nI handle all of our personal finances, mostly because I love it, and i also was raised with a lot of healthy money habits, conversations, and discipline, while he inherited some bad habits he worked really hard to get rid of (with great success!) But he gives me a lot of credit to everyone, and so his mother has asked for my advice in this process of finding her financial footing.\nHere are her finances-car is paid off, no debts beside a mortgage, they refinanced at the right time and owe ~$250k on a 15 yr fixed at 1.8% with about 12 years left. The total payment is about $2000/mo. She receives social security, and he had two retirements/pensions (one private and one from the military) that she will receive spousal benefits from. Those calculations haven\u2019t been finalized yet, but all in all she should be receiving ~$6000/mo in benefits, and I think they are all structured to continue to adjust as cost of living increases. So that is nice. The total monthly incoming will be less than it was when he was alive, because the survivor benefits are a % of the old amounts, but FIL spent quite a bit on \u201chis things\u201d and I think his discretionary spending was more than the drop in income will be.\nHere is the sticky part. My father in law has a 300k life insurance payout. My MIL has expressed a desire to pay her mortgage off. Reasons provided are to free up that $2000/mo, and because she has the ingrained belief that debt is inherently bad/risky/to be avoided when possible. I think those reasons are expressed in good faith, and i also suspect she is afraid she will \u201close\u201d the money if she doesn\u2019t do this, whether by spending irresponsibly, being taken advantage of by someone, or a bad investment.\nThe idea of paying off a 1.8% mortgage hurts my brain, but I want to be able to offer her some concrete alternatives that are ZERO risk. Where would be the best online bank to put it into a savings account? Or if i continue to get the vibe she wants to not be allowed to touch it, where are the best 6-12 month CD rates right now? What about annuities?\nI dont think she would want to be exposed to any sort of market, whether real estate or the stock market, and that is where all of my personal experience is.\nIf I hope to help, i think it has to be a guaranteed return she will be getting, hopefully at 2-3x return on investment better than 1.8%.\nLet me know if i am leaving anything important out, and sorry if i made any reddit newbie errors.

Later, sure, but not now.\nDoor Dash isn't steady income, and it has direct costs to you that will bite you in the ass later. When the extra miles cause your car to break down sooner, you'll lose access to that income stream.\nYou know what your expenses are. $1700. That's your budget. Don't spend outside of that for the foreseeable future.\nGo get a job at a warehouse. Low end, you're looking at $19/hr starting. That's $3,040 a month before taxes, $2500 a month net. An extra $800 every month to the credit card past the minimum payments you're currently making gets it paid off in about 3 years. That'll also help your credit score.\nYou're only at 40 hours a week with the warehouse. I highly suggest a second income stream that's not gig work putting miles on your car. Fast food places are currently paying $15/hr, and they're flexible, so you can probably get a 4-hour M-F shift. That's an extra $1200 gross, or about $800 net.\nNow we're looking at $1600 extra that you get to pay toward the card each month, which sets you up to be free and clear in less than 18 months.\nIn that time, you'll likely see opportunities to increase your wage at the warehouse. Take every opportunity to do so that you can. If you can bump to $22/hr, that's $3520 gross or about $3000 net. $1300 from that plus the $800 from the side job has you out in just over a year, and then once it's paid off, you can relax.\nBecause your expenses are $1700 a month and you're earning twice that at your primary job. You can save. You can put away for retirement. You can buy yourself something nice on occasion.\nIf you want to focus on starting a video production company, great! Do that in the time you used to be serving chicken fingers. You don't need that job anymore.\nThe biggest thing I can suggest though is to avoid the gig work. Get a steady income. Make steady payments. Leave weekends open because if you work 12 hour days 7 days a week it will kill you and you'll never dig your way out.\nThe best time to get ahead of this was $30,000 dollars ago.

Is that just your contribution? Does employer contribute any more on top of that?\n$146k currently with $1,374/mo additional contribution for 27 years until age 64 with 6.5% inflation-adjusted return, you would have just under $2M in present-day dollars at age 64. With a 3.5% SWR (safe withdrawal rate) you would be able to withdraw $70k per year (in present-day dollars) from savings from age 64 onward and then use social security to fill the gap on top of that. Now, your actual returns would probably be a bit lower in the final ~10 years before retirement because of the shift to bonds and this might drop your numbers to be able to only withdraw ~$60k per year or so from savings in present-day dollars.\nMy guess is you\u2019re making $97k now but my guess is you\u2019re only recently making that much and only recently saving 17%. Because if just 10 years ago at age 27 if you were saving $1,374/mo in S&P 500 index fund from 2013 to now you would have $297k in your 401k\u2026..so my guess is your income has ramped up a lot over the last few years and same for your savings rate. The issue is that if your income starts ramping up a lot\u2026.you\u2019ve got to save more to be able to replace that income in the shorter time before retirement. And if you don\u2019t, then as your income ramps up if you get used to spending that huge income\u2026..retirement gets rough because now you\u2019re used to huge income but don\u2019t have savings to replace it in retirement.\nTo put numbers behind it if you\u2019ve get a $20k raise next year but keep your savings rate on overall gross salary at 17% - you\u2019ll have $2.2M in present day dollars at age 64 with 6.5% inflation-adjusted return. So you\u2019ll be used to living on a 20% higher income\u2026.but your savings at age 64 will be only 10% higher. Meaning you\u2019ll only be able to withdraw $77k but you\u2019ll be used to living on $117k. That\u2019s hard.\nIn other words, as you get raises you need to raise your savings RATE to avoid getting used to living on that larger income and to help savings catch up.\nUpvote\n529\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\nghostboo77\n\u2022\n21 hr. ago\nGreat post, thanks.\nI made in the lower 40s from 2012-2015. 60-75k from 2015-2021 and upper 80s/90s the last few years.

If all else fails, you can fix this rather quickly especially if you have a job - you can just withhold less on your next paycheck and deposit this to the Roth IRA within the 60-day time limit as an indirect rollover.

The apartment complex I lived in for all those years is going for almost exactly what you quoted on rent for a 1BR apt. Rent is really the thing you want to spend your focus on optimizing; note that it's like double what all of your other expenses in your budget are combined.\nI think some of them might differ a bit from reality depending on where you go lifestyle-wise, but you have a good amount of buffer--you don't seem way off or anything. I'd recommend, since you are in a reasonable ballpark and have some buffer (1k extra a month gives wiggle room) that you of course keep your budget in mind, but mostly observe your spending in the first few months rather than try to fit your living expenses into the budget you make before you have any real data. In other words, spend a bit of time gathering the data you might want without trying to be over-restrictive. My feeling is you have the space to be able to do this since you wouldn't be living starkly paycheck-to-paycheck and it will give you much better data to set up a new budget if you do so.\nThe first thing that stands out to me that might need tweaking is your food budget; housing and food are the two major cost of living categories that are higher out here. I'd actually say $400 might end up a bit low in practice. It can be hard to hit a $100/week food budget, even for a single person, moreso if you like food as you mention. Much of the price of food is in labor, and if it costs more for you to live out here, and it costs more just to take up some space (your apartment), keep in mind that these costs will also be present in the price of food in order to pay the people involved in its creation. Milk is a good general gauge: where I grew up in the midwest, a quick search shows a gallon of milk for just about $3, out here a similar gallon is about $7.\nThose cows gotta pay the rent too :)\nEating out will have the same feel to it; if you go to a nicer restaurant (not fast food) that will likely set you back in the $20-30 range, more if you have drinks, and moving up from there. That's one meal taking up like a third of your week's food budget. Also keep in mind it's likely the case that a co-worker might suggest everyone grab some lunch together, or if you plan on dating you might have two meals at a nice restaurant, also you're in a new area for the first time so you've gotta try out the local food (Sunnyvale has phenomenal Indian food if you are into that). Probably a good exercise if you have a feel for how much you spend on food today is to find some similar \"comparable foods\" from where you are now and in Sunnyvale and do a quick comparison of their prices like I did with the milk. After a few foods you'll get an idea of a multiplier to use to scale your food budget. (This will also depend of course on whether or not you get free or reduced price food from work, which isn't unusual out here.)\nThis is mostly useful because those cost of living calculators miss a substantial nuance which I like to highlight to anyone thinking of moving out. Yes, rent is high here. So is food. Also healthcare is typically higher too. Anything that requires land or local people will be pricier.Conversely, products that don't change price based on location are, relatively, cheaper. What I mean by this is: there are lots of Teslas driving around out here. Why? A Tesla Model Y in California is about 50K. If your rent is $2800/mo, that's about 18 months of rent. A Tesla Model Y in the Midwest is about 50k. If you rent a comparable place (again drawing from where I grew up, which is a Midwest mid-sized city) rent is about $1200, that's about 42 months of rent. So a Tesla \"feels like\" it's a bit less than half the cost, relative to rent, in the Bay Area. Same with other manufactured products like electronics, clothes to some degree, etc... that don't rely on labor or land so much for what they cost in a particular area.\nCongrats on your offer, and I hope if you take it you enjoy the Bay Area! It's beautiful out here, the food is phenomenal (highly, highly recommend the Mountain View farmer's market during the summer, it's great!) and there's lots of nature / hikes / places to explore if you're in to that sort of thing.\nUpvote\n2\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare", "darkmatterhunter\n\u2022\n5 hr. ago\nNo 401k contribution?\nYour car insurance might be a bit higher than that.

Broadly speaking, if big sections of the home arrived on wheels pre-assembled, then yes, it is essentially a trailer and it will depreciate most likely, and that is a very big downside compared to a typical single-family home. The land itself will at least appreciate, but the dwelling will not.\nHowever, if you are referring to a prefab home, that is a different beast and can actually be a very good home because all of the individual pieces, wall frames, etc. are manufactured off-site and usually to a very good specification because they are \"cookie cutter\", and then shipped to the site and assembled.\nUpvote\n28\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\nthealmightyagender\n\u2022\n6 hr. ago\nIf we're not planning to move out, is the downside of depreciating in value in case we sell and move out?

I won\u2019t go into depreciation. The build quality is different. Your older mobile homes walls can be 1x4 or 2x4. The subfloor is going to be exposed on the underside. There should be insulation, but in an older model animals and time have probably destroyed it. This isn\u2019t normally a problem for a house on a slab, crawlspace or basement. However, the mobile home will more than likely have vinyl or metal skirting which allows critters easier access. Due to the mobile home sitting up so high, you\u2019ll want to wrap your water pipes so they don\u2019t burst if it gets bow freezing. Older mobile homes typically have different dimensions than stick build homes due to the differences. This means you can\u2019t just pop into your local hardware store for supplies, you\u2019ll want to go to a mobile home specialty store.\nIf it were me, and I wanted to go this route, I would buy the land with the mobile home. Save up some money. Then, try to use the land as collateral to build something permanent. Mobile homes fill a role for housing, and many people have spent decades in the same mobile home. It can be done. I would almost recommend renting one before buying one. Especially, if you\u2019ve only lived in a stick build.\nExperience: My grandparents used to own a mobile home park. Spent my teen years and early adult life repairing mobile homes in the park. I spent my early childhood living in a different mobile home park. Lived in trailers and doublewides on various acreages.

While a banker will approve you for a house with a small down payment, you should not do it. And there is no rush because rent to price ratios are very low right now.

When I asked why, I was told if they converted my US salary 1:1 then I would be \"overpaid\" compared to colleagues in that region. And my manager told me privately that I may not be able to negotiate with the higher management much since they were \"giving me\" the city I wanted and the cost of living there is lower. My salary is just average for my role in NY and it's sufficient for the new city, but given the exchange rate, it would be a 10% drop from my current salary plus would be in local currency (instead of USD).\nI am leaning towards accepting the relocation but given I will be doing the same job as what I do in NY in the new city, and I didn't ASK to be relocated, should I still try to negotiate for a higher salary or a match to my current one?

Take notes of the call including name of person in billing, date, time. Again, ask for itemized statement to include the details of the misc services. Ask for ICD10 billing codes and CPT codes. This will help identify exactly what was ordered/done.\nSecond, contact your insurer and discuss with them. See if this bill was even submitted. If you've hit out of pocket max, then you really shouldn't have to pay this if hospital/provider is in network. If out of network, see next item. Again, note names, dates, times of call.\nThird, review the No Surprises Act to see if it might apply to your situation. Armed with this knowledge, you can formulate your strategy for the next call to hospital billing.\nFinally, know that you can negotiate down this amount if you decide to pay it. Many hospitals have programs for payment plans or reduced/free services. Some will ask for tax forms to validate hardship. However, you can always try to negotiate. I recently got 20% knocked of just by calling and saying I couldn't pay full amount anytime soon, but I could probably pay 80% right now to be done with it. 10 min call, saved 20%. Again, takes notes. You can always escalate to higher person at the hospital until you feel you've exhausted all options. Then decide if you really want to pay it or let it go to collections.\nFinally finally, you could let it go to collections. This is where you can really negotiate because the hospital has likely written it off and sold the debt. The collection agency will buy it for pennies on the dollar and then try to collect as much as possible to cover their cost and make a profit.\nUpvote\n43\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\nWynter_born\n\u2022\n21 hr. ago\nThis person knows their way around medical billing.

Though some are \"portable\", letting you take it with you after leaving. You then become responsible for the full premium, which may have been covered in full/part by your ex-employer.\nIn my experience, most employer-paid group policies have a death benefit in the 1-3x salary range. You may have the option for a \"supplemental\" policy through your job benefits to increase that, though that comes with its own extra cost. But when you may be leaving dependents (spouse, kids, other family) behind who were relying on your income, a general guideline is to buy a payout of 10x your income.\nOr maybe you're not yet in a place where that level of insurance is necessary. If you're single, it might be sufficient right now to just have enough to zero out any debts and cover expected funeral expenses.

No strings.\nOtherwise relationships are ruined: A loanee who can't pay money back on an agreed on schedule begins lying or dissembling about how they are spending money, and casual \"how are you\" chat is no longer trustworthy.\nThese even happens a little when you give money as gifts. \"Oh, I did X,\" is immediately followed with some justifying remark, like \"because it was on sale.\"\nBut since we are not waiting for money back, no biggie.\nWe have cleared some small credit card debt for some of the more mathematically challenged members of the family so people could stop throwing away money on interest payments. This helped for, say, three years before the problem recreated itself.\nWhile certain family members would starve before asking us for more money, others get less and less shy . . .\nMostly we are glad to have been able to help, glad we have not been hit with the catastrophes ourselves.\nBut there is one family member who \"catches up\" yay but then spends on something extravagant that I consider an expense only people far wealthier than we are could even consider.

But smarter people than me have studied it and come up with some strategies that are somewhat expected to (though no guarantee) work for most people.\nIf you spend $50,000 a year after retirement and you have 5% gains, then you need 1,000,000 to draw from to break even. How do you consistently get 5% gains though? If you have stock, you have to sell stock to make profit, so you'd start running out of stock.\nMost plans don't assume that the principal remains static through your entire retirement. People don't live forever, so a reasonable set up is to have a \"glide path\" where you start with some amount, draw some amount out each year, even to the point where your principal will decrease. Your retirement savings remain invested (though somewhat conservatively) so it is still growing at this time. If everything lines up \"perfect\" you die just as you spend the last dollar of cash that was withdrawn to zero out your retirement savings.\nObviously, in reality you want some safety buffer. And maybe you want to leave a decent (or sizable) amount to distribute to heirs.\nSo there's the concept of a \"safe withdrawal rate\". You build up a nest egg, and as you start withdrawing you set some percentage of that as your dollar amount. That dollar amount gets adjusted for inflation during future years, you don't actually start each year looking at your balance and take X% of it out each January. This is supposed to let your invested savings \"ride out\" any particular down year, though there is still risk of a badly timed / extended downturn to have a bigger negative impact.\n4% is the most commonly suggested SWR, though I've seen some debates whether less / more is actually ok. Analysis of hypothetical balances and withdrawal rates seem to settle on that allowing a given starting balance to last 30-ish years, lining up with most people's retirement duration.\nHow do you know how much your yearly expenses will be in 15, 20, 30 years? Inflation can make the expenses go up.\nYou're right that inflation makes talking about future expenses more difficult. But you can \"bake in\" inflation into the annual growth estimates of your savings so the ending amount comes out as \"today's dollars\". You can then compare your estimated spending (still in today's dollars) against the SWR of that balance to see how things line up. So with your example $50k lifestyle, that'd equate to a starting retirement balance of $50,000 / 4% = $1,250,000 in today's dollars, which may be more like $2MM in 2060 dollars.\nIt is daunting, but time is on your side (along with the magic of compound growth).

It's a way to estimate how much money you need to retire.\nThe way you calculate your \"number\" is to take your estimated annual expenses and multiply by 25.\nThis amount should (in most cases) last you through a typical 30-year retirement with a 4% withdrawal rate.\nSo, say for example that the minimum you can possibly live on is $25,000 per year. If you multiply this by 25, you get $625,000. This would be the minimum amount you could retire on.\nObviously, if your annual expenses are higher, then that number will be higher. But this is all just a ballpark estimate and the farther away you are from retirement, the harder it will be to accurately estimate your expenses. But it's a starting point. This is why people retire in places with low taxes and a low cost of living. They want to stretch their retirement nest egg further by reducing their annual expenses.\nAlso remember that you can work all sides of the equation. Earn more, save more, and spend less.

Most of which is in my name; ~30k spread between several high interest cards, but I am hopeful that the total amount will be split in half. I have not been able to afford the minimum payments for a couple of months now, and it is all so overwhelming. My attorney just filed for divorce with the court on Monday, so surely the allocation of debt will take some time.\nHer car was recently relinquished to me because the loan is only in my name. It has negative equity in it, probably around 8k. I have not had much luck trying to sell it privately for anything close to what I owe, and with my current credit tanked, I don't think I'd be able to finance the difference. I really want to avoid the voluntary surrender/repossession, but I almost feel like throwing in the towel is my only option here. payments are $600/month and I am currently 2 months behind, so any hardship programs offered would require to be current on the loan.

I could probably get 2 jobs for the winter months, but individually, they would pay less than I am making now. So my future income is not certain. My license is suspended until about jan/feb and I live in the mountains where it snows a lot, so I am wondering how much I will be able to hustle.\nAlso recently got a letter from the IRS saying my ex wife and I owe $8100 in income taxes from 2021, as an amended return because apparently there was something that we did not claim. We had HR block do our taxes that year, and thought we had paid what was owed, but this came as a surprise. I have not contacted HR block or the IRS, but this is another high priority thing I need to deal with asap.\nI probably have about 15k in student loan debt, which I don't even know the current status of, probably default. I know bankruptcy wouldn't clear this, but just wanted to add it.

Pay the hospital bill out of pocket in the mean time.\n(Optional) Then wait a few more decades.\nThen withdraw from HSA to reimburse yourself.\nRemember you don't have to withdraw from HSA in the same year the medical expense occurs.

We lived in CO for five years and owned a condo that we bought because it was the cheapest we could afford to buy (Vail area) and we didn\u2019t want to rent. We basically lived paycheck to paycheck for the first two years we were there. My wife is a Nurse Practitioner, and I was a project manager for a construction company. We finally reached a point where we were a bit more comfortable financially, but then we had a son, and decided that we wanted my wife to stay home with him for the next few years and perhaps work part time. We ended up selling our home there, and now we are living in NC closer to family. We found a cheap place to rent for a year.\nI am starting my own GC business, and I currently have one project over the next year to complete. Part of the reason we moved to this area was because I had a guaranteed large house to build to get started on my own. We don\u2019t think we will stay in NC, as we were originally from TN, so we didn\u2019t want to buy anything here. We would like to eventually build on some land, so we weren\u2019t interested in buying anything for the next year or so, especially with interest rates being what they are (although they probably won\u2019t go down any time soon).\nWe profited $200,000 off the sale of our home. We both are going to pay off the remainder of our credit cards, vehicle loans, and student loans. Both our vehicles have 6% or greater interest rates, and our credit cards are obviously higher than that. We don\u2019t have much student loans left, but just want to be done. By the time we pay off all those loans and cards, We should be left with somewhere around $170,000.\nI\u2019m mainly wanting some advice on how we should handle this $170,000. Some things to note:\n\u2022 We really have minimal savings to speak of, as we had to pre-pay for our year rent because I am technically self-employed now and do not have 2 years of income records for that.\n\u2022 We would like to set up some type of college fund for our son. Whether we contribute a lot or a little to that now I\u2019m not sure?\n\u2022 As I stated above, we would like to buy land in the near future (1-2 years) and the type of land we want around here is roughly $80K-$100k. I would like to build our house on it, and I would be self-performing a lot of this work on the side. We would not be buying land for most likely at least a year from now.\n\u2022 We would like to invest as much as makes sense to.\nI am extremely ignorant when it comes to personal finance and investing, which is sad because my undergrad was in finance. . .\nThanks ahead of time!", "upvote": "1", "comment_no": "1", "comments": ["millerlit\n\u2022\n34 min. ago\nPut emergency fund in high yield savings account.

Apologize in advance for the long post, I have a lot of mixed feelings and it is just easier for me to type things out. I am a 25 y/o M who is planning on moving out of my parents house at the start of the new year. I have been stuck with whether it is best for me to rent or buy when I move out. I would be moving in with my s/o where we would be splitting housing costs. I live in a HCOL area (Southeastern MA), where the average rent for a 1b/1b apartment would be about $2,200-2,400 a month. I had been looking to buy a townhouse or starter home the past few months in the $350,000 range, but have been beat out on multiple offers (all cash or >15-20% over asking with no inspections), and have became very burnt out and frustrated with the whole process of home buying. My financial situation is:\nSalary: base of $108,500 a year (expecting a minimum 5% raise prior to moving out, possibly up to 10%), but realistically closer to $120,000 with overtime and shift differentials. Monthly take home pay about $5,000 after taxes/retirement/benefits.\nSavings: $30,000 emergency fund in a HYSA currently at 4.3%, $10,000 in a general savings account, $50,000 I saved for a house that is now one month into an 11 month CD at 5.4% (No penalty for early withdrawal just loss of interest for 3 months). My parents have also been generous enough to offer an additional $15,000 for a downpayment when I find a place. Checking: about $1,000 where i put money each pay check for day to day expenses.\nMy concern is that if I do not buy now I will miss my window to ever purchase something. I have seen housing in my area soar even in the few months I've been looking, and I will often see houses sell for 30-40% more than they did just a couple of years ago. However I have already tried purchasing a place already and don't feel like I would really do much better trying to buy something now considering how few places are for sale in my budget.

Please pardon me if you already know this, and it's just a slip of the tongue...\nI have dental insurance that is in-network with my dentist.\nThis is not correct. Your dentist is either in or out of network with your insurance, not the other way. Your insurance company keeps a list of dentists who have reached an agreement with them on prices. This list is the \"network\" and the list belongs to your insurance company... not your dentist.\nThe reason I bring this up is that the people you should ask about network status is your insurance company... you want to go to the website or call the helpdesk and check if your dentist is in-network. Your dentist might know (or think) they are in-network, but it's not their problem if they are wrong (you will be the one who has to pay the out-of-network rates). Considering the difficulties they seem to be having even knowing what your insurance is, I wouldn't put much faith in their statement that they are in-network.\nNow, your dentist might have meant that they \"take\" your insurance. That still does not mean they are in-network... that just means they will file a claim with your insurance company. Your insurance company will treat that claim as in or out of network.\nI've run into this problem myself... I got medical services from a doctor who thought they were in-network, and I didn't check with the insurance company. We found out months later that they were out-of-network.

If the answer to 'a' is yes & the answer to 'b' is no, then you should probably figure what you value your current \"rent free\" status at. The company has hopefully done the math on what they think providing this housing is worth, but what is it worth to you? Additionally, there's also the question of what your alternative will cost if you can't buy a house in short order- probably not much sense leaving to go make $70k, if renting a place would cost you $26k a year & you're now effectively making $1k less. (That'd also bring up the question of tax implications- if you're not paying taxes on the value of your housing as a fringe benefit, but you'd be paying taxes on the extra salary used to rent somewhere else in the meantime, that could be a pretty big difference)\nUpvote\n1\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare", "suggesting_ideas\n\u2022\n2 hr. ago\ni would take the higher paying job. plus these arent the only two options for the rest of your life.\nUpvote\n1\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare"], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/16ushmw/switching_jobs_and_cant_decide/"}, {"title": "Equity Award Documentation : r/personalfinance", "date": "2023-09-28 21:37:02.234000+00:00", "content": "Hi Reddit Finance, I'm just gonna keep this short and sweet.\nAfter 5 years at my company, I have finally been awarded my equity.
