You\\'re varying from the market weighting of the index fund. This is not inherently a bad thing. There\\'s nothing inherently superior about market cap weighting in an index from an investing standpoint. It\\'s simply the easiest to maintain a fund around, as it\\'s mostly self correcting; index fund managers would likely have less to transactional losses from rebalancing; the fund would mostly be self-correcting. Based on the way the market works, there\\'s no fundamental return inherent to any particular market capitalization.\\\\nLet\\'s look at this a different way:\\\\nConsider: dividing the S&P500 index into 2 halves and investing only into 1 half at random would have the same theoretical return as the S&P500 index on the whole. Both halves, by definition, must have the same average return as the whole.\\\\nYou can even divide this down further into individual components; the index return on average must match the (weighted) return of all it\\'s pieces by definition. Thus, putting the S&P500 on a dartboard and giving a monkey some darts- by buying the companies hit, you would expect the monkey to have similar returns to the S&P500 on average.

Diversification between two ETFs can help spread risk. Dividend growth can help combat inflation over time. Cons: Potential tax implications from dividends, especially in a taxable account. Dividend cuts or stagnation can impact income. Option 2: 100% VTSAX\\\\nPros: Total market exposure provides diversification across sectors and company sizes. Potential for capital appreciation. Systematic withdrawals can be adjusted based on market conditions. Cons: Selling shares can lead to capital gains tax implications. Market downturns can impact the principal if withdrawals continue. Other Considerations:\\\\nCash Position: While holding cash can be a defensive strategy, especially if you\\'re earning over 5%, there\\'s the risk of missing out on potential market gains. However, having a cash buffer can be beneficial during market downturns. Tax Efficiency: Consider tax-efficient strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting or investing in tax-efficient funds, to minimize the tax drag in your taxable account. Diversification: Consider diversifying across asset classes, sectors, and geographies. International exposure (e.g., through VXUS) can provide additional diversification. Alternative Investments: Real estate (e.g., REITs) or other alternative investments can provide additional income streams and diversification. Bond Ladder: While you mentioned not being interested in bonds, creating a bond ladder with staggered maturities can provide consistent income with principal returned at maturity. Given your preference for not selling shares and your concerns about consistent dividends, Option 1 seems more aligned with your goals. However, a hybrid approach, where you allocate a portion to VTSAX and a portion to dividend-focused ETFs, might provide a balance between income and growth.\\\\nYou can checkout the article \\\\u201cBest ETFs for Roth IRA\\\\\".

Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year\\\\u2019s FactSet analyst consensus.\\\\nOperating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.\\\\nEstimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla\\\\u2019s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla\\\\u2019s core automotive business now.\\\\nWe have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company\\\\u2019s cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.\\\\nPersonally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations.

But also bond prices and stock prices tend to be anti-correlated: when investors are bearish about stocks they pile into safer assets like bonds, driving up prices.\\\\nBut these are not laws of nature - there was an epic bond market crash last year as the Fed jacked up interest rates, and both bond and stock prices took a hit in the last few market crashes.\\\\nIf you do decide to allocate some of your money to bonds, the important thing is to pick a percentage that you\\'re comfortable with and stick to it for the long term.

I want to invest in ETFs because I don\\'t know how to analyze stocks.\\\\nA little bit about myself.\\\\nI am 25 years old guy. I grew up in Slovakia and moved to the UK. Since I grew up in Slovakia I learned to live quite frugally. That means I can invest about 80% of my salary. I am not scared of risk, as I mentioned, I grew up in the country with very little money, I live frugally and I like it this way. I have everything I need, but I don\\'t want my money to lose its buying power in the future.\\\\nI will use tax-efficient ISA to invest and will max it every year (20k GBP for now). I am looking for advice on what ETFs to invest in, and also would be nice to explain to me a little about how to pick an and ETF, why to buy this or that.\\\\nSo far I picked 2.\\\\nEQQQ and DGRG.\\\\nI do understand that it\\'s not diversified much. That is the reason I am looking for advice. Feel free to ask me questions if needed.\\\\nThank you all in advance.\\\\nUpvote\\\\n1\\\\nDownvote\\\\nReply\\\\nreply\\\\nShare\\\\nShare\", \"Wan_Haole_Faka\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n1 day ago\\\\nJust bought my first individual stocks today: ALB, ELV, BTI, WM & WMT. I did some dallying with BABA because I bought some and then sold it all like an hour later! I don\\'t yet do proper valuations, but my sister made a bunch of money in NVDA and wanted to support my more profitable investing endeavors. It was kind of gamble money, but I feel good about most of the picks. I\\'ll learn something regardless of what happens.\\\\nI have so many questions. I\\'m coming from the indexing approach but am at a unique place in my life where I\\'m still kind of young (32), have a growing interest in finance, no dependents and feel like I could be good a business valuation.\\\\nOne random question is about dividends. I\\'d rather chase value than yield, but BTI is on sale and offers a good dividend. Owning a company like this (or any dividend paying company), does the dividend change inversely to the stock price? Is it ever locked in? They\\'ve raised their dividend consistently for I believe 23 years, but I don\\'t understand how that related to the yield changing as the share price changes. I normally wouldn\\'t look for dividend stocks, but I was attracted to BTI because of the potential for great growth.\\\\nWhy does everyone try to predict when a recession is coming? Doesn\\'t Buffet ignore the drama of the economy and stock market? I can\\'t help but get caught up in the drama. My understanding for indexing is that you ignore the drama and keep buying. I think Warren pretty much does the same thing, but with buying businesses. On one hand, the \\\\\"bottom\\\\\" never happens and I end up regretting being out of equities. On the other hand if it is indeed a bearish market, part of me wants to continue my contributions (IRA & brokerage) but put everything into Treasury bill ladders so that money doesn\\'t take a hit.\\\\nIf you have any insight you\\'d care to share about my internal conundrums, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thus, you get the benefits of the stock increasing in value and getting some cash on a regular basis. A lot of brokerages will let you DRIP your dividend back into the stock for free (for most stocks) enabling easy extra growth of your position.\\\\nTo expand on #1, especially for retirees, dividends are a source of income that doesn\\'t require you to sell the underlying asset to earn income.

Please look at my history if you\\'d like to see previous post.\\\\nThe first texts I received from him in September (after our 2 month hiatus), he said we could drop the IUL - great, I thought he got the hint. Set up a meeting last week with which he spent the entire 1.5 hr slot into asking why I didn\\'t want to do the IUL and trying to convince me we should still do it. Again, sounded good and I had a better understanding of the product. He agrees to reduce the initial deposit from 100k to 50-60k and sends me the 52 page application again (with 60k written on the initial contribution line). For a second time, reading the contract made it clear to me that this was not what I wanted in my investing portfolio.\\\\nThe following Monday (after my initial post on this subreddit), I again told him I will not be following through with the IUL with which he asked me to specify why. I said \\\\\"It\\'s 52 pages of stipulations, you want me to specify one?\\\\\" His response: \\\\\"is there something specific or because there\\'s so many pages?\\\\\" I recognized his snarky remarks, but left it alone. I kept it short and sweet because I wasn\\'t in the mood to argue, my answer was still no. His words : \\\\\"I can see we are not ready for this level of investing.\\\\\" I could literally feel the tantrum he was having 13 states away and it did bring me some pleasure.\\\\nHowever, the passive aggressiveness continued. I received an email this morning with an attachment of a page from a book with the headline saying \\\\\"Investing Roadblock: Procrastination\\\\\". Was he seriously insinuating that I was \\\\\"procrastinating\\\\\" because I didn\\'t want to go through with the IUL? I was LIVID. Next reply was me requesting dissolution of the contract and for full refund that the contract CLEARLY STATES I deserve if I am not satisfied with the service or recommendations. He was paid upfront for one year ($1500). Well, this was his response - \\\\\" [...] People hire me to make the best decisions possible and challenge them when making questionable ones. [...]\\\\nAs for a refund, we have spent numerous presentations and hours with you educating on all options and you have chosen to go against the advice without reason so unfortunately, we will not be able to provide a refund. Best of luck in your future endeavors!\\\\\"\\\\nI won\\'t go off on here like I did in my email to the firm\\'s CFO, but how DARE he, the self-entitled prick! I got into contact with the firm and received the refund in full, an apology from the administration (they were good people), and a promise that he will be dealt with.\\\\nYou try to break a legally binding contract and I\\'ll come after you. I am thinking of reporting him to FINRA and SEC, but am unsure if these are the correct institutions for a formal complaint? I\\'ll reiterate that the firm he works for has good people in it.\\\\nThanks for the help on my last post - I\\'m still not super literate with finances, but I\\'m in a better understanding now then I was when I signed with my ex FA.

I\\'m a true fiduciary advisor and here\\'s what\\'s going on. The term fiduciary use to be more definitive but now being loosely used by people like the guy you met with. Someone like me is truly fiduciary because I own a registered investment adviser firm, not licensed as commissioned broker, and not insurance licensed. But some people are triple registered, so they can wear 3 hats. They\\'re suppose to differentiate which hat they\\'re wearing when they talk to you. So they can sell managed accounts that would fall under fiduciary care, sell you loaded mutual funds which would be commission compensation, or sell you IUL and also get a commission there from the insurance company.\\\\nTo me, it\\'s like someone who\\'s a professional MMA fighter, father of 2 children, and a church pastor on the weekends. They can be all 3 things, but they need to clearly separate and differentiate in what capacity they\\'re acting. They can legally choke out a dude at work, but can\\'t do that at home or church. The guy basically told you he\\'s a pastor while leading you into the octagon to punch you in the face.\\\\nBut anyway, good on you for trusting your gut instinct and pushing back. Advisors are trained salespeople and have ways to get people to do things, sometimes it\\'s aggressive sales tactics. The more you talk, the more you\\'ll lose because they can counter any objection you have.

However, in recent history gold was undervalued until in the late 70s when gold shot up in value. It is mean-reverting and a good inflation hedge for multi-century estates. Do not use gold in your portfolio as an inflation hedge if you have a normal time horizon like three to four decades.\\\\nUpvote\\\\n9\\\\nDownvote\\\\nReply\\\\nreply\\\\nShare\\\\nShare\\\\nsexlexia_survivor\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n2 days ago\\\\nI would echo this for most commodities.\\\\nUpvote\\\\n1\\\\nDownvote\\\\nReply\\\\nreply\\\\nShare\\\\nShare\", \"sexlexia_survivor\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n2 days ago\\\\nI would echo this for most commodities.\\\\nUpvote\\\\n1\\\\nDownvote\\\\nReply\\\\nreply\\\\nShare\\\\nShare\", \"AutisticBeachBear\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n2 days ago\\\\nGold market is one of the most manipulated markets in the world.

It is possible the ultra low rates from 2008 to 2020 are simply atypical.\\\\nFor some argument that the long term treasuries are so high due to the high FED funds rate,\\\\nAnyone making this argument does not understand the Fed or the Fed Funds rate. The Fed Funds rate changes the cost of borrowing overnight for banks that drives a change in short term interest rates. There is no correlation between fed funds rate and 30 year bond. The yield curve is currently inverted with short term rates higher than long term rates.\\\\nThe Fed has no good levers for influencing long term interest rates and even if they could it wouldn\\'t do them much good. Inflation is based on demand vs money supply today not 30 years from now. For the Fed to break the back of inflation requires changing short term behavior and that requires changes in short term interest rates.\\\\nUpvote\\\\n2\\\\nDownvote\\\\nReply\\\\nreply\\\\nShare\\\\nShare\\\\nAutoModerator\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n2 days ago\\\\nThe Fed is short for \\\\\"Federal Reserve\\\\\", not an acronym, and doesn\\'t need to be set in all-caps.

However even if you own individual bonds they will fall in value too. You can choose not to sell them when they have lost value but they have lost value. The difference between individual bonds and an ETF/MF is you can have a fixed maturity with individual bonds. This bond will mature on this day. Short of a default it will return back to par by that date.\\\\nAn ETF/MF will have a floating constant maturity. This means it can take up to a number of years equal to the fund duration to recover loss of principal from the point rates moved against you. With a ETF/MF with a 7 year maturity you are constantly 7 years from maturity.\\\\nHonestly in the long run it all comes out in the wash but individual bonds are bit more transparent/obvious.

Maybe giving an example will help make things clear to you.\\\\nFor the sake of argument let\\'s say I have a lump sum of $100k that I intend to use for retirement in 20 years. My strategy will be simple (if somewhat inadvisable), I\\'ll invest 100% in an S&P500 tracking fund for 20 years then switch 100% to bonds. Let\\'s assume a constant 10% return on the S&P500 for that time period (again, all made up numbers for demonstration). After 20 years my $100k is now $670k. If this was in a taxable account I have to pay capital gains tax on that $570k profit when I sell it all and buy up bonds. In a tax advantage account I don\\'t pay anything when selling the stocks and buying bonds. Then for the rest of my life I\\'ll be living off this sum, either selling bonds or waiting for them to mature and then making regular withdrawals from the account to pay for things. In a taxable account I\\'m paying taxes every time I sell a bond for more than I payed for it (mostly regular income tax since it\\'s a bond) or everytime a bond matures or makes a coupon payment, but I don\\'t pay any taxes when I withdraw. In a tax advantaged account I\\'m only paying taxes on the money I withdraw, the money the bonds pay me aren\\'t taxed directly.\\\\nSo in summary in a tax advantaged account I\\'m paying $85.5k when I move from stocks to bonds, and then I\\'m paying income tax on each bond payment I receive even if I\\'m not immediately going to be withdrawing and using that money. In a tax advantaged account my money grows tax free, and I only pay taxes on the money I take out of the account.\\\\nDoes that make sense? The government views each transaction in a taxable account as something that immediately gets taxed, but the advantage of a tax advantaged account (pun very much intended) is that those individual transactions aren\\'t taxable, just the money you pull out to use is taxed the gains aren\\'t directly taxed. Of course things are more complicated, Roth accounts are initially funded with post-tax money so you don\\'t get taxed a second time on withdrawal, and there are often minimum required distributions on tax advantaged accounts so you can\\'t play the system, and 401k/IRA contributions are made with pre-tax dollars so just contributing can lower your tax bill.

But the most difficult thing about timing the longer duration bonds is that there are other important factors to consider besides Fed rate. Generally, the 2 year bonds try to predict the Fed rate, so they may be a little higher or lower. But the long-duration products consider inflation expectations, currency strength, and lots of chart analysis.\\\\nBased on fundamentals and macro data, I think inflation will fall eventually, I think the Fed is doveish and will drop rates as soon as they possibly can, and I think a recession is very likely. Therefore, I think long-duration bonds are a screaming buy right now. Technically, however, I think we will likely have longer duration yields continue rising to 5%, so I will probably wait to buy. This would be about 86 on TLT, the most liquid bond ETF. I think the highest we go on the long-duration yields is to a level yield curve on the 20-2 year, which would be a tad over 5% for now.\\\\nKeep in mind, the change in bond price is roughly (yield change) x (duration). So, a 25-year duration product will fall roughly 12.5% if we miss time by 0.5%.

The bears have very good arguments (term premium, long-term inflation may not go below 3%, etc.) where as the bulls have questionable arguments: 1. if 10yr rate is higher than 4.2%, something like bank or fund will break and the fed will buyback the long-duration treasury. 2. recession may happen.
