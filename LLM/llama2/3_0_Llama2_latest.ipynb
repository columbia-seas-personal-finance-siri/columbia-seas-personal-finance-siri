So, it\\'s not surprising that many investors don\\'t know where to begin. And although the market is well above its recent bear market lows, plenty of stocks are trading for significantly less than they were a year or two ago.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBut what are the best stocks to buy in 2023? Although I don\\'t have a crystal ball that tells me what stocks will deliver the best returns, I\\'ve tried to do the next best thing. In this article, I\\'ll discuss 10 stocks that I think could be great buys in 2023 for long-term investors looking to put their money to work.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhy these 10?Why these 10?Before we get to the stocks, let\\'s acknowledge three caveats:Choosing the best stocks to buy today depends on your personal financial situation. To get a feel for where you stand, read our guide on how to invest in stocks. It walks you through topics such as establishing an emergency fund, allocating assets, and choosing the right stocks for you.I like these stocks as long-term investments, even in a bear market. I have absolutely no idea what they\\'ll do over the next few weeks or months. In fact, if inflation stays elevated longer than expected, interest rates climb higher than investors believe they will, or the U.S. falls into a deep recession, it\\'s entirely possible that most or all of these could decline in the near term.Although I ensured some variety, the list below isn\\'t meant to be a fully diversified portfolio. Instead, they\\'re my highest-conviction long-term stocks to invest in for 2023 and beyond. The best one-step way to diversify your holdings is to build the core of your portfolio around something like the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (VT  -1.36%).Now let\\'s get to my list of the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for the long term -- from smallest market cap to largest -- followed by the summarized buy thesis for each.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPublicly Traded Company\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA company that issues shares that are publicly traded, meaning the shares are available for anyone to buy and sell on the stock market.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe top 10 stocksThe top 10 stocks to buy in October 2023Etsy (ETSY  -3.65%), $8 billionPinterest (PINS  -4.03%), $18 billionRealty Income (O  -0.2%), $38 billionMercadoLibre (MELI  -2.47%), $67 billionPayPal (PYPL  -2.15%), $68 billionShopify (SHOP  -4.85%), $75 billionIntuitive Surgical (ISRG  -2.35%), $105 billionWalt Disney (DIS  -2.61%), $150 billionBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A  -1.14%)(BRK.B  -1.45%), $815 billionAmazon (AMZN  -3.66%), $1.42 trillion\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nElevator pitches for each stockNow that you\\'ve seen my top 10 best stocks to buy now, you may be wondering why I picked each company. Here\\'s a quick rundown of why I\\'m such a fan of each as a long-term stock to invest in.1 - 31. Etsy\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, Etsy was growing nicely by connecting craft makers with customers looking for something a bit more out of the ordinary than mainstream e-commerce fare. During the pandemic, e-commerce got a huge boost. But Etsy absolutely skyrocketed, growing at more than twice the rate of overall e-commerce.As the pandemic and its accompanying e-commerce surge have cooled off, so has Etsy\\'s momentum. However, its growth has been strong across all product categories and continues to be impressive despite the tough economic climate. In fact, in the second quarter of 2023, Etsy\\'s marketplace sales volume was up 175% over comparable pre-pandemic (2019) levels.As you may notice throughout this list, powerful platforms get my attention. Make no mistake: Etsy is one of them. Few e-commerce companies go head-to-head with Amazon and survive. Etsy not only survived when Amazon rolled out its own handmade items platform -- it won. But this could still be the early days of an excellent long-term growth story.Because of its platform and brand strength, Etsy\\'s market opportunity is in the hundreds of billions -- if not trillions -- of dollars. With about $13 billion in sales on its platform in 2022, it has just started to scratch the surface. And with the stock falling significantly in the recent growth stock downturn, now could be a great time for patient long-term investors to take a closer look.2. Pinterest\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPinterest is an oasis of positivity in a social media landscape that\\'s grown increasingly depressing and divisive. That partially flows from what Pinterest is about -- ideas.People go to Pinterest to focus on things, not on other people. Whether building a dream deck, baking a kid\\'s birthday cake, or updating your wardrobe, Pinterest gives people visual inspiration for the things they want to get done.Recent results show that Pinterest\\'s growth has resumed, with the user base growing by 8% year over year to 465 million in the second quarter of 2023. There\\'s still lots of long-term user growth potential, and management recently said that growth is re-accelerating.The most exciting thing from a long-term investor\\'s perspective is that Pinterest has a massive opportunity when it comes to the monetization of its users. This is especially true internationally, where the bulk of Pinterest users are located but where the least monetization has occurred.There\\'s also a big monetization opportunity as the company pivots away from its traditional ad-focused model and tries to find ways to incorporate e-commerce into its platform. And the pivot certainly makes sense.Pinterest is a place where people go to find things they might want to buy, and it hired e-commerce veteran Bill Ready as its CEO in 2022 to accelerate its pivot. It could take a while for the company to truly realize its e-commerce potential, but it is making impressive progress, and long-term investors could be handsomely rewarded.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Realty Income\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to value, growth, and income, it\\'s tough to find a more well-rounded stock for long-term investors than Realty Income.If you aren\\'t familiar with it, Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and primarily invests in freestanding, single-tenant retail properties. Walgreens (WBA  0.58%), Dollar General (DG  1.74%), and FedEx (FDX  -1.86%) are just a few examples of its top tenants.Realty Income owns about 13,100 properties in the U.S. and Europe, most of which are rather recession-resistant and less vulnerable to e-commerce disruption than many other retail businesses. Plus, the company\\'s triple-net lease structure helps create a steady, predictable income stream.The proof is in the performance. Since its 1994 listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Realty Income has produced 14.2% annualized total returns, handily outperforming the S&P 500. It has paid 639 consecutive monthly dividends, and as of September 2023, its yield is about 5.7%. The company has increased its payout for more than 100 consecutive quarters, and there\\'s no reason to think this pattern will end anytime soon.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4 - 64. MercadoLibre\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs one of my favorite long-term stock investments in the market, MercadoLibre is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, and for good reason. The company operates an e-commerce marketplace with a dominant presence in some of the region\\'s most populous nations, including Brazil and Argentina.However, there\\'s a lot more to MercadoLibre. It operates a fast-growing payments platform called Mercado Pago, a logistics service known as Mercado Envios, a business lending platform, and more.The marketplace saw $10.5 billion in merchandise volume in the second quarter of 2023, 47% higher than the same quarter in 2022. Mercado Pago processes almost $170 billion in annualized volume, with almost three-fourths coming from outside the company\\'s e-commerce platform.Both main parts of the business are growing rapidly. And don\\'t overlook Mercado Credito, the company\\'s young but fast-growing (and highly profitable) lending business. Mercado Credito has $3.3 billion of outstanding loan balances and has grown rapidly so far.The best part is that all these businesses are in the relatively early stages. MercadoLibre\\'s merchandise volume is roughly 8% of Amazon\\'s, and its Mercado Pago payment volume is about 12% of the amount that PayPal (PYPL  -2.15%) processes. So, there\\'s a ton of runway ahead.MercadoLibre isn\\'t just the Amazon of Latin America -- it\\'s the Amazon, PayPal, Square, Shopify, and more, all rolled into one. And it\\'s in a much earlier stage of growth. As the e-commerce and fintech landscapes in Latin America evolve over the coming years, MercadoLibre could be a major long-term beneficiary.5. PayPal\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPayPal is an absolute cash machine that has been beaten down by about 75% from its highs.The main reason is that investors were disappointed when PayPal\\'s growth abruptly slowed down in 2022, and management conceded that its previous user growth targets were unrealistic. Plus, with fears of a recession, we could certainly see lower consumer spending in the near term -- which would mean lower fee income for PayPal.However, it\\'s important for investors to realize that this is still a strong and highly profitable business. The company has about 430 million active users between PayPal and Venmo and processes about $1.3 trillion in annualized payment volume. The company expects about $5 billion in free cash flow for 2023 and has been aggressively buying back its own stock.It\\'s not hard to see why PayPal\\'s management is choosing to use its capital this way. The stock is trading at its lowest price-to-sales ratio ever and trades for just 12 times forward earnings.6. Shopify\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShopify operates a platform designed to allow businesses of all sizes to sell their products online, with a particular focus on empowering smaller businesses and growing with them by establishing long-term relationships.Shopify offers a subscription plan starting at $39 per month for businesses and many adjacent services that help businesses operate smoothly, such as payment processing solutions and logistics.Shopify\\'s \\\\\"one-stop shop\\\\\" approach to enabling e-commerce has turned it into a powerhouse. It now has more e-commerce sales flowing through its ecosystem than any other company besides Amazon. However, Shopify could be just getting started.The platform has generated $6.3 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. However, this is just a fraction of its estimated $153 billion (and growing) market opportunity as more retailers shift their focus to online sales.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRevenue\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRevenue is a business\\\\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nE-commerce is still in the relatively early stages, making up slightly more than 15% of retail sales in the United States. Shopify has the No. 2 share, giving it a powerful ecosystem with network effect advantages over competitors.The stock\\'s price is still well below the highs in the recent market downturn due to recession fears and signs of a slowdown in consumer spending, and Shopify looks like a great long-term opportunity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n7 - 107. Intuitive Surgical\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRobot-assisted surgery beats shaky human hands. That general thesis hasn\\'t changed much from when I first noticed Intuitive Surgical stock in 2005. The da Vinci surgical system is the clear market leader, and the \\\\\"razors and blades\\\\\" model helps it generate a recurring stream of revenue as its systems are used to perform procedures.Intuitive Surgical is dominant in its space, with a market share of about 80% worldwide. And it has lots of room to grow as the adoption of its surgical systems and the number of supported procedures increase over time. This is particularly true in many international markets, where the implementation of robot-assisted surgery could be a long-tailed growth catalyst for this excellent business for decades to come.8. Disney\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe House of Mouse is like the all-weather tires of a portfolio. The pandemic hurt its theme park and movie businesses but helped the Disney+ streaming service, which has grown into a powerhouse years earlier than Disney expected.In fact, Disney+ now has about 146 million subscribers fewer than four years after launching, while the company\\'s initial five-year goal called for 60 million to 90 million. To be sure, Disney is still trying to figure out the best ways to make Disney+ a profitable business, but it\\'s clearly progressing in the right direction. The market is absorbing price increases with little impact on the subscriber count.In 2023, demand for Disney\\'s theme parks, movies, and cruise line has been very strong despite inflation pressures and recession fears. In fact, revenue is far greater than in comparable pre-pandemic times in Disney\\'s parks due to initiatives that have driven higher per-guest spending. Plus, the company recently announced it will invest $60 billion over the next 10 years in its theme parks and cruise lines to make sure they stay full for the foreseeable future.With Disney also laser-focused on the profitability of Disney+ and its other streaming platforms, Hulu and ESPN+, this could be a powerful combination of profitable all-weather revenue streams. In a nutshell, Disney might be the ultimate combination of an in-person experiential play and a tech-focused growth business.Its amazing stable of intellectual property (Marvel Cinematic Universe\\\\/Star Wars\\\\/ESPN\\\\/Pixar\\\\/Disney) and cash-machine theme park business gives it a margin of safety that makes it perhaps the safest stock on this list. And it still has tremendous profit growth potential as the newer areas of its business evolve.9. Berkshire Hathaway\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlthough most of this list is made up of growth stocks, or at least stocks that have some exciting growth drivers, this is the relatively boring value pick of the bunch (but in the best possible way).Berkshire Hathaway owns a collection of about 60 subsidiary businesses, including household names such as GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, just to name a few. Berkshire also owns a portfolio of common stocks worth about $355 billion that includes massive stakes in Apple (AAPL  -0.78%), Bank of America (BAC  -2.96%), Chevron (CVX  0.23%), American Express (AXP  -2.96%), and Coca-Cola (KO  -1.08%), as well as positions in dozens of other companies.Most of the larger positions were personally handpicked by legendary investor Warren Buffett, who still manages the bulk of Berkshire\\'s investments. In fact, If Berkshire were a mutual fund, it would be the world\\'s largest actively managed mutual fund.The Buffett bears will say he has lost his fastball, but Berkshire continues to produce market-beating returns in most years despite its massive size. And while Berkshire certainly won\\'t produce the 3,787,464% return (not a typo) it has produced from the time Buffett took the helm through the end of 2022, there\\'s no reason to believe it won\\'t continue to outpace the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future.Buffett won\\'t be in charge forever. But Berkshire is his legacy, and he\\'s been stress-proofing it for years to ensure it\\'s in solid shape long after he\\'s no longer running things. Showing his faith, he and longtime business partner Charlie Munger have been buying back shares regularly. That\\'s a good sign for patient long-term investors like us.10. Amazon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAmazon doesn\\'t really need much of an elevator pitch for most people. The company has a dominant lead in the U.S. e-commerce market. And its Amazon Web Services cloud platform is also a market leader, with a significant lead over the other two large players in the space, Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -1.3%)(GOOG  -1.38%).However, more growth potential exists than you might think. We\\'re a long way from maximizing e-commerce adoption; it still accounts for a little more than 15% of all U.S. retail sales. The cloud industry is relatively young and expected to roughly quadruple in size to a $2.3 trillion market by 2032. Amazon also has a ton of potential in other areas, such as healthcare, grocery stores, neighborhood markets, and more.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelated investing topics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat to Invest In: Use Your Money to Make Money\\\\n\\\\nSo where should you invest?

It then uses the trained system to make inferences about new data it\\\\u2019s never seen.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images with those objects are provided to the system, which \\\\u201clearns\\\\u201d how to detect those objects in other images. The more objects in images it detects, the more accurate the detection system becomes.Companies employ artificial intelligence in two main ways. Many tech companies use AI to make their existing operations more powerful such as through high-profile applications, including robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL  -1.3%), (GOOG  -1.38%), uses AI to filter out spam for Gmail users. Amazon (AMZN  -3.66%) uses AI to recommend products to customers, while Netflix (NFLX  -0.94%) uses AI to guide content creation and recommendations.More recently, OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT has shown how far \\\\\"generative AI\\\\\" a division of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas, has come. The potential of such large language models is enormous.Some companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology needs.

Nvidia1. Nvidia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLeading graphics chip company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its graphics cards becoming the de facto standard in data centers around the world. Machine learning\\\\u2019s training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, requires less. Graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well.Nvidia\\\\u2019s data center business represents a steadily increasing share of the company\\\\u2019s total revenue and topped its gaming segment in revenue in fiscal 2022. This segment isn\\\\u2019t all AI-related -- Nvidia\\\\u2019s graphics cards are used to accelerate a wide variety of data center applications. But AI is one of the driving forces behind the company\\\\u2019s growth.Its chips are popular for demanding workloads that applications like large language models require, and the company just launched a new set of inference platforms specifically designed for generative AI.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenerative AI\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) where computer systems create new content.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSelf-driving cars are another area of focus. Nvidia develops platforms, including hardware and software, that can power driver-assistance features, as well as fully autonomous driving.A self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require a tremendous amount of computing power, and that\\\\u2019s exactly what Nvidia\\\\u2019s platform delivers.Its professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has a lot of potential in AI.Nvidia\\\\u2019s graphics cards could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but for now, the company is in an enviable position.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. IBM2. IBM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis legacy tech company is an integrated provider of hardware, software, and services to large enterprise customers. Its mainframe computer systems are still ubiquitous in certain industries, and it regularly signs multi-year technology deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.IBM\\\\u2019s strategy with AI is to apply the technology in ways that augment human intelligence, increase efficiency, or lower costs. In the healthcare industry, IBM\\\\u2019s AI technology is being used to create individualized care plans, accelerate the process of bringing new drugs to market, and improve the quality of care, though it sold off its Watson Health business in early 2022. In the financial services industry, via the company\\\\u2019s 2016 acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, IBM is using AI to help clients with the daunting task of financial regulatory compliance.While the market for AI products and services is fragmented, IBM is leading the industry. Market research firm IDC ranked IBM as the leader in AI software platforms with a 13.7% market share in 2020, up 46% from the prior year.IBM is a complicated company undergoing transformation, and AI is far from its only growth opportunity. But if you\\\\u2019re looking to invest in a company that is well-positioned to benefit from the AI boom, IBM is a good choice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Microsoft3. Microsoft\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft has gotten a lot of buzz of late thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft began investing in the tech start-up in 2019, and recently put another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine, powered by ChatGPT, and the company is racing to incorporate GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Bing.CEO Satya Nadella has said repeatedly that he sees AI as the next major computing platform, and the $10 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of its conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition in order or get left behind as it did with mobile.Microsoft is also harnessing the power of AI in other ways, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs, and using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools.4. Amazon4. Amazon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps no company is using AI more widely than Amazon. Founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos has been an evangelist for AI and machine learning. Although Amazon started as an online retailer, technology has always been at the company\\\\u2019s core.Today, Amazon uses artificial intelligence for everything from Alexa, its industry-leading voice-activated technology, to its Amazon Go cashierless grocery stores, to Amazon Web Services Sagemaker, the cloud infrastructure tool that deploys high-quality machine learning models for data scientists and developers.Amazon\\\\u2019s e-commerce business is also built on AI since algorithms run its top-flight recommendation engines for e-commerce and video and music streaming. In addition, Amazon uses AI to determine product rankings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAmazon Bedrock\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAmazon Bedrock is a service for building generative AI applications on Amazon\\\\u2019s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEven Amazon\\\\u2019s logistics operations benefit from its AI prowess, which helps with scheduling, rerouting, and other ways to improve delivery accuracy and efficiency. Drone delivery, which the company has long sought to implement, would be yet another AI application for the tech giant.It\\\\u2019s difficult to quantify the impact of AI on Amazon\\\\u2019s business, but it\\\\u2019s clearly a key component of the company\\\\u2019s competitive advantage. Throughout its history, Amazon has been at the forefront of emerging technologies such as e-commerce, e-books, cloud computing, video streaming, and voice-activated technology. AI provides much of the infrastructure that helps the company move into new businesses quickly and effectively.5. C3.ai5. C3.ai\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nC3.ai may be the closest thing on the stock market to a pure-play AI stock, as the \\\\u201cai\\\\u201d in the company\\\\u2019s name and its ticker might indicate. While the companies on the list above are diversified tech giants or chip makers that have some businesses involved with AI, artificial intelligence is the entire focus of C3.ai.C3.ai is a SaaS company whose software allows companies to deploy large AI applications. The company\\\\u2019s tools help its customers accelerate software development and reduce cost and risk, and they have a wide variety of applications. For example, the U.S. Air Force uses C3 AI Readiness to predict aircraft systems failures, identify spare parts, and find new ways to increase mission capability. European utility company Engie (ENGIY  -1.81%) is using C3 AI to analyze energy consumption and reduce energy expenditures.It\\'s also launching its own generative AI suite with enterprise search as the first product. Enterprise search allows customers to use a natural language interface to locate and retrieve relevant data across all of the enterprise\\'s information systems.C3.ai is the first mover in its industry and says it isn\\\\u2019t aware of an end-to-end enterprise AI development platform in direct competition with it. That unique positioning could make the company a big winner over the long term, although the AI SaaS market is evolving and could attract competition from big cloud infrastructure such as Amazon or Microsoft.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMachine Learning\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMachine learning is a technique by which artificial intelligence programs are trained.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMachine learning stocksMachine learning stocksAll of the stocks above use machine learning technologies, but if you\\\\u2019re looking for more options, here are two others worth considering:Alteryx (AYX  -2.04%) is a provider of data analytics software that empowers data workers to solve problems with a wide range of analytics and data science tools. Its Alteryx Intelligence Suite, one of several products, offers machine learning capabilities, including automated modeling and natural language processing to build models.DocuSign (DOCU  -0.5%), an AI-powered leader in digital signature software, has made significant inroads into machine learning in recent years. In 2020, the company acquired Seal Software, an enterprise contract analytics company that uses machine learning for organizing and identifying risks and opportunities in contracts. For years, DocuSign has been building machine learning tools such as DocuSign Insight to help with contract analysis through natural language processing.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDeep Learning\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDeep learning, an advanced branch of AI, finds patterns in data, aiding predictions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDeep learning stocksDeep learning stocksDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It\\\\u2019s the most advanced kind of artificial intelligence and is crucial in technologies such as self-driving cars. Deep learning is making advances in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary, and it differs from machine learning in that it doesn\\\\u2019t require human inputs.Among the companies closely associated with deep learning are Nvidia, whose GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.Alphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAI is a growth businessAI is a growth businessTotal spending on AI systems is forecast to reach $97.9 billion in 2023, up from $37.5 billion in 2019. For the five-year period ending in 2023, the AI sector is predicted to grow at an annualized rate of 28.4%.With the AI market already large and still growing quickly, plenty of companies can profit from AI.

It\\'s also passed high-level exams for law school, medical licensing, and MBA programs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArtificial Intelligence\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArtificial intelligence is the use of machines to mimic human intelligence.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nImage source: Getty images\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUsing a simple chat interface, ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, is able to answer questions directly and is as easy to use as Google Search. The free AI chat interface signed up 100 million users in just two months after its launch on Nov. 30, 2022, and has the potential to disrupt industries from internet search to content creation.In this article, we\\'ll discuss the implications for ChatGPT and robot chat more generally, how you can get exposure to it as an investor, and whether you should invest in ChatGPT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to invest in ChatGPTHow to invest in ChatGPT\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChatGPT isn\\'t publicly traded, and OpenAI, the company that built it, isn\\'t either. However, there are a number of ways to get exposure to ChatGPT.The most direct one is through Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%). Microsoft has had a strategic partnership with OpenAI since 2019, and has invested billions of dollars into the AI start-up over its history. After ChatGPT was unveiled in early 2023, Microsoft invested $10 billion into OpenAI, showing both the company\\'s confidence in OpenAI\\'s potential and its belief that artificial intelligence is the next major computing platform.Another way to get exposure to ChatGPT is through NVIDIA (NVDA  -2.83%). NVIDIA is one of the world\\'s most valuable semiconductor companies, and the leading producer of graphics processing units. Its GPUs are often used for artificial intelligence purposes, training large language models like ChatGPT and processing large amounts of data. They are a key component in many machine learning models.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinally, Perion Network (PERI  -3.4%) is another potential winner from the ChatGPT rollout. Perion is a small-cap ad tech stock, but it has a strategic partnership with Microsoft\\'s Bing search engine, and Microsoft is rolling out a new version of Bing, powered by ChatGPT. If Bing gains market share on Google with the help of ChatGPT, Perion is likely to be a big winner.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData source: Company websites and YCharts.

Microsoft1. Microsoft\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft is best known as a diversified global tech giant. It makes money from everything from its Windows operating systems, to its Azure cloud infrastructure service, to subscription software products like its Office software suite, as well as hardware like Surface, gaming products under Xbox, and the LinkedIn professional social network.However, more recently, Microsoft has been getting attention for its strategic partnership with OpenAI. The company has bet big on OpenAI and ChatGPT. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called AI the next major computing platform, and has already leveraged the power of ChatGPT and OpenAI\\'s tools in a number of products, including Azure.Microsoft\\'s biggest bet with ChatGPT is on Bing, and Nadella has said that a new search engine race is happening. He\\'s also eager to take the fight to Alphabet\\'s Google (GOOGL  -1.3%)(GOOG  -1.38%). Nadella views the landscape in search as asymmetric, with Alphabet unable to afford losing market share in search, and any gain being a win for Bing.If you\\'re looking for the company that\\'s most closely connected with OpenAI and ChatGPT, Microsoft is your best choice. However, the company is so big that only a small amount of the business is exposed to ChatGPT.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. NVIDIA2. NVIDIA\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNVIDIA stock has taken off over the last decade as its graphics processing chips have become a vital part of everything from gaming to self-driving cars to artificial intelligence.AI comes with extraordinary computing demands, and NVIDIA\\'s chips are able to handle the workload better than its competitors.For example, UBS (UBS  -2.09%) estimates that 10,000 NVIDIA graphics processing units were used to train ChatGPT, and some analysts estimate that 30,000 of its GPUs are now being used to run OpenAI\\'s chatbot.NVIDIA has also teamed up with Microsoft to build a massive cloud AI computer using tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs and other NVIDIA AI software tools.Given NVIDIA\\'s strength in AI computing power, including products like the Omniverse, NVIDIA looks like a good AI stock to own if you\\'re looking for an investment poised to make gains from the growth in artificial intelligence.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Perion Network3. Perion Network\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnother way to get exposure to ChatGPT is through Perion Network (PERI  -3.4%), a small-cap ad tech firm. Perion is best known for its intelligent hub, which connects advertisers and publishers to optimize ad placement and inventory for both parties.However, the company also brings in almost half of its revenue through search, largely through its partnership with Bing. Perion is one of the ad tech companies the Microsoft search engine uses to help to optimize ads and conversions. Perion gets revenue share through Bing when a user click on an ad leads to a sale.In its recent earnings presentation, Perion shared a quote from Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, who said that each additional percentage of market share that Bing gets translates to almost $2 billion in annual revenue, meaning that it wouldn\\'t take much to move the needle for Perion.Considering the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17, the stock could soar if the new Bing begins to gain traction.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelated investing topics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in Quantum Computing Stocks\\\\n\\\\nAn in-depth look at the best quantum computing stocks in the U.S stock market this year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in Cloud Computing Stocks\\\\n\\\\nMoving operations to the cloud is the way of the future for many companies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in a Quantum Computing ETF\\\\n\\\\nQuantum computing is becoming increasingly affordable and effective to the point that there\\'s now a quantum computing ETF.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now\\\\n\\\\nChips are the building blocks of the technology we use every day.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShould you invest in ChatGPT?Should you invest in ChatGPT?ChatGPT and generative AI have the potential to change everything from the way we work to the way we learn and are entertained.It\\'s still very early for ChatGPT and the next iteration of AI, and some are even asking if ChatGPT is safe to use since the product is new and has only just started to be monetized. Additionally, the hype around AI stocks has surged in recent months, leading shares of AI stocks like C3.ai (AI  -2.96%) and anything else connected to artificial intelligence to soar.However, for risk-seeking investors, it\\'s not a bad idea to invest some of these ChatGPT stocks. Microsoft seems like the most stable bet of the bunch; the company has a wide range of products to make use of the AI chatbot and its partnership with OpenAI will help it benefit from future advances in generative AI technology.NVIDIA should also be a winner since it\\'s likely to benefit from increased demand for computing power, and Perion Network stock has a lot of upside potential if the new Bing begins to catch on.Although the tech stock crash in 2022 may have chastened tech investors, ChatGPT has crystallized the potential of AI and is likely to kick off a new race in artificial intelligence.To hedge your bets, investing in all three of these stocks and holding them for the long term may be the best way to get exposure to ChatGPT. You can also invest in an AI ETF for broad exposure to the sector.Any new technology comes with risk for investors, but the upside potential from the new generative AI technology could be enormous.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\\\\u2019s board of directors.

But how do you actually purchase those shares?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nImage source: The Motley Fool\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do you actually buy shares of stock?How do you actually buy shares of stock?\\\\u00a0Fortunately, the process of buying your first shares of stock online is relatively quick and easy. Here\\'s a step-by-step guide to start your stock investing journey.1. Open a brokerage account1. Open a brokerage accountFirst, you\\'ll need a brokerage account to buy stock. Consider two main factors when selecting an online stock brokerage:What the brokerage offers: Does the brokerage firm offer every product and service you need? Some brokerages publish excellent educational resources for new investors. Others provide access to stock research and analytical tools. Some online brokerages maintain branches where you can receive guidance in person. Perhaps other features, such as the ability to trade international stocks or buy fractional shares, are important to you.The user-friendliness of the brokerage platform: Is the brokerage\\'s platform easy to navigate? If you want to trade using your mobile device, then the brokerage\\'s mobile interface needs to be easy to use. Many of the largest brokerages allow you to use play money to experience their trading platforms before you invest, so try a few to decide which platform you like the most.Most major online brokerages, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW  -4.2%), Fidelity, and others, have eliminated trading commissions. For most investors, this largely takes cost out of the equation when choosing a brokerage platform.Once you\\'ve chosen a brokerage, you\\'ll need to complete a new account application. This is typically quick and easy, but you\\'ll need to have photo identification handy, such as a driver\\'s license and your Social Security number.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSocial Security Number (SSN)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA nine-digit identification number issued to United States citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents originally meant to be used exclusively to track earnings and benefits.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'ll also need your bank account information if you want to fund your new brokerage account using your checking or savings account. You can choose to open a standard brokerage account. Or, you can choose to establish an individual retirement account (IRA), which comes with some pretty nice tax advantages.Another decision you may face is whether to establish margin privilege for your new brokerage account. Having margin privilege enables you to buy stocks with money borrowed from your brokerage.To be clear, investing on margin is generally not a good idea for most investors. However, establishing margin privilege can confer some other benefits. For example, you may begin trading in your brokerage account before your deposited funds have cleared if you have margin privileges.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. Decide which stocks to buy2. Decide which stocks you want to buyIn this article, we won\\'t go to deep into the many possible methods of analyzing and selecting individual stocks to buy. However, the next step is to determine which stocks you\\'d like to purchase.A couple of pointers:Follow a \\\\\"buy and hold\\\\\" strategy: Only buy stocks that you want to own for many years. Don\\'t buy a stock just because you think it will perform well over the next few weeks or months.Diversify your holdings: Don\\'t put all of your money into just one or two stocks. Even if you\\'re investing only a relatively small amount of money to start, diversify your portfolio by buying a few shares of several different stocks. With the advent of commission-free trading, owning the stocks of many different companies does not incur any additional expense.Learn more about how to choose which stocks to buy by checking out our comprehensive guide to investing in the stock market.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Decide how much to buy3. Decide how many shares to buyTo determine how many shares you should buy, first decide how much money you want to invest in each stock that interests you and then divide this amount by the stock\\'s current share price. You can find stock prices on your brokerage\\'s platform by searching for either the stock\\'s ticker symbol or the name of the company.If your brokerage trades fractional shares, you can purchase any dollar amount of a stock regardless of its share price. Only some brokerages allow you to buy or sell fractional shares. If your broker doesn\\'t, you\\'d need to round down to the nearest whole number of shares to determine how many you can buy.As an example, let\\'s say you want to invest $1,000 in Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%). You check Microsoft\\'s share price and find that it\\'s $330. Dividing $1,000 by this share price indicates that you can buy up to 3.03 shares. Assuming your brokerage doesn\\'t trade fractional shares, you would purchase three shares of Microsoft stock.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4. Choose an order type4. Choose an order typeDifferent order types exist for stock purchases. The type of order you place to buy stock specifies the conditions under which you want your broker to transact on your behalf. Placing a market order, which instructs your broker to buy the stock immediately and at the best available price, is typically the best order type for buy-and-hold investors.However, you may instead want to place a limit order. This indicates to your broker the maximum price for a stock that you\\'re willing to pay. For example, let\\'s say that a stock is currently trading for $20.50 per share. You want to buy it only when the price is less than $20, so you would place a limit order. Your broker would only buy shares on your behalf if the stock\\'s price dips below $20.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBuy Limit Order\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAn order that instructs your broker to buy a stock or other security only at or less than a specific maximum price.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5. Place the stock order5. Place the stock order with your brokerageTo place a stock order, access the appropriate section of your brokerage\\'s platform. Then and enter the required information.Your brokerage will typically ask for the company or stock ticker name, whether you want to buy or sell shares. You\\'ll also enter either the dollar amount or how many shares you want.After you tap the \\\\\"place order\\\\\" button, your stock purchase should be executed in a matter of seconds (if the order type is a market order). Your portfolio should immediately update to reflect your ownership of the newly purchased shares.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelated investing topics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAverage Stock Market Return\\\\n\\\\nStock market results can vary wildly from year to year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat to Invest In: Use Your Money to Make Money\\\\n\\\\nSo where should you invest? We\\'ve got the options covered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to Invest $100 in Stocks & More\\\\n\\\\nYou can start your investment journey with a small sum of money. Here\\'s what to do with it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShould I Buy Stock Now or Wait?\\\\n\\\\nThe best time to buy a stock is usually yesterday, but think about the long term.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n6. Build your portfolio6. Build your portfolioThe final step in this process is to build out your investment portfolio. Now that you have a brokerage account and know the basics of how to buy and sell stocks, you can keep adding money to your brokerage account and investing in stocks you\\'d like to own for years to come.As a final thought, it can be tempting to monitor the performance of your stocks every day (especially at first). However, it\\'s important to maintain a long-term mindset.Certainly, you can and should read quarterly reports and subscribe to news alerts. But if your stocks\\' prices decline somewhat, don\\'t sell in a panic. And, if your stocks\\' prices rise by a few dollars, resist the urge to cash out. The best and easiest way to build wealth over time is to buy shares of great companies and hold them for as long as the companies remain great.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCharles Schwab is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Green Thumb Industries1. Green Thumb Industries\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGreen Thumb Industries ranks as one of the largest U.S. multi-state cannabis operators. It owns over 80 retail cannabis stores in 15 states across the U.S. and operates 18 manufacturing facilities. Green Thumb also holds enough additional licenses to roughly double the number of its retail locations.The company has been profitable on an annual basis since 2020. It continues to deliver revenue growth and maintains a strong balance sheet even with macroeconomic and cannabis industry headwinds. Green Thumb should have plenty of growth potential over the long term as the U.S. cannabis market expands.For now, Green Thumb\\'s shares can only be bought and sold on over-the-counter (OTC) markets in the U.S. But if federal cannabis restrictions are lifted, the stock could be listed on major U.S. stock exchanges. This would almost certainly be a huge catalyst for Green Thumb.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOver-the-Counter (OTC)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOTC is short for \\\\u201cover the counter.\\\\u201d OTC securities trade through decentralized networks instead of a major exchange.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. Cresco Labs2. Cresco Labs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCresco Labs, like Green Thumb, is based in Illinois. It operates retail cannabis stores in 10 states, including six of the most populated states in the U.S. Cresco is the top wholesaler of branded cannabis products in the U.S.The company is growing rapidly through acquisitions and opening new retail locations. Cresco\\'s pending acquisition of Columbia Care (CCHWF  -4.76%) will make it the largest multi-state operator based on revenue. The acquisition is moving forward with overwhelming approval by Columbia Care shareholders and a thumbs-up from the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Cresco and Columbia Care are divesting some operations to satisfy regulators. Once the deal closes, Cresco will operate in 18 U.S. markets, including 12 states with annual cannabis sales of more than $1 billion.Like Green Thumb, Cresco Labs\\' shares can currently only be traded on OTC markets in the U.S. The stock will likely be a big winner if the Biden administration moves forward with federal marijuana reforms that allow U.S. stock exchanges to list the shares of cannabis companies that operate in the U.S.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Innovative Industrial Properties3. Innovative Industrial Properties\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. cannabis companies can\\'t easily secure capital from banks or financial institutions since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIP) helps to solve the cash shortage for growing marijuana companies. It buys properties owned by U.S. medical cannabis operators and leases the properties back to them. The sale to IIP provides the cannabis operator with much-needed cash, and the lease agreements create a steady revenue stream for IIP.Innovative Industrial Properties has grown significantly in recent years and now owns properties in 19 states. The company continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth even with some of its tenants facing financial challenges. Because IIP is organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT), it returns at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders.In some ways, IIP wouldn\\'t be helped as much by federal cannabis reform as other companies. Its shares already trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). If traditional banking services were available to U.S. cannabis operators, IIP could face increased competition. However, federal reforms would likely cause the U.S. cannabis market to expand -- which should work in IIP\\'s favor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRevenue\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRevenue is a business\\\\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4. GrowGeneration4. GrowGeneration\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGrowGeneration is another ancillary provider, and the largest specialty retail chain focused on the cannabis market. It operates over 60 stores in 18 states. Because the company\\'s business doesn\\'t violate any existing federal marijuana laws, its stock can trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange without any issues.Demand for the company\\'s hydroponics products has fallen due to an oversupply of cannabis in the U.S. This has caused short-term headwinds for GrowGeneration that are likely to continue in 2023. However, the company\\'s long-term prospects remain bright, and GrowGeneration should be in a position to significantly rebound when market conditions improve.5. Scotts Miracle-Gro5. Scotts Miracle-Gro\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScotts Miracle-Gro is facing the same supply-and-demand market dynamics as GrowGeneration. Like GrowGeneration, its shares can be traded on a major stock exchange (in this case, the NYSE) since Scotts doesn\\'t violate any federal marijuana laws.The company\\'s Hawthorne Gardening subsidiary ranks as a leading supplier of hydroponic gardening products to the cannabis industry. Hawthorne should have a significant growth runway over the long term despite some near-term challenges.Although Hawthorne Gardening has been a primary growth driver for Scotts, the company still generates the majority of its total revenue from consumer lawn and garden products. Higher commodity prices are currently squeezing margins for the business. However, the company\\'s consumer lawn and garden products provide a relatively steady counterbalance to its cannabis supply unit.6. Jazz Pharmaceuticals6. Jazz Pharmaceuticals\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIreland-based Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired the cannabis-focused biotech company GW Pharmaceuticals in May 2021. GW\\'s drug Epidiolex is the first cannabis-based medicine to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Epidiolex, which treats two forms of childhood epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex (a rare disease where benign tumors grow on organs), has been a big commercial success, with sales of $736.4 million in 2022.Jazz is currently evaluating Epidiolex in a late-stage clinical study as a treatment for patients with epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures. Its pipeline also features other cannabis drugs in phase 2 testing, targeting autism spectrum disorders and related issues. In addition to its cannabis products, Jazz markets sleep-disorder and cancer drugs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA brief overview of the marijuana industryLet\\\\u2019s cover some of the basics you need to know before investing in marijuana stocks.The marijuana industry is divided into three broad categories. Marijuana growers and retailers cultivate and package cannabis products and sell them to consumers. Biotechnology companies develop and market cannabis-based pharmaceutical drugs. Ancillary marijuana businesses provide products and services to cannabis companies without touching the plant.Cannabis can be medical or recreational. Medical cannabis patients use cannabis or cannabis extracts to treat health conditions and have recommendations or cannabis prescriptions from physicians. Recreational cannabis users purchase marijuana or cannabis extracts purely for enjoyment and must be 18 and older and living in a jurisdiction where recreational use of the plant is legal.Geography matters. Medical cannabis is legal in many more countries than recreational cannabis. In the U.S., cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. However, a growing number of states have legalized medical and\\\\/or recreational cannabis. And -- as mentioned earlier -- the Biden administration is taking some steps that could lead to federal decriminalization of marijuana. The rapid growth of the U.S. cannabis market is translating into impressive growth by U.S.-based cannabis companies, while marijuana companies in Canada -- where the plant is already fully legal nationwide -- are expanding more slowly. Canada is one of the global legal markets where supply is outpacing demand and leading to falling cannabis prices.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nImpact of COVID-19 on marijuana stocksThe COVID-19 pandemic affected nearly every part of the global economy, including the cannabis industry. In many U.S. states, cannabis dispensaries were designated as essential businesses. Cannabis sales boomed in some states during the first few months of the coronavirus outbreak, driven in part by more time spent at home and increased anxiety. Marijuana growers and retailers benefited, as did ancillary providers selling gardening supplies and other products to these companies.However, not all cannabis companies fared well in the pandemic. Recreational cannabis retailers in tourist destinations such as Las Vegas saw their customer traffic dwindle, causing some of these dispensaries to start focusing on home delivery. In the medical segment, people delayed doctor visits, causing new patient starts to drop. Biotech companies experienced logistical challenges that affected sales and research progress.To a large extent, the worst appears to be over for the cannabis market with respect to COVID-19, but some effects are still being felt.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelated investing topics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in Pharmaceutical Stocks\\\\n\\\\nThe makers of the medicines that keep us happy and healthy can be great places to invest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in Genomics Stocks\\\\n\\\\nThese companies study genes and their functions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in the Best Healthcare Stocks\\\\n\\\\nHealthcare is a universal need.

If you buy broad-based index funds, you\\'re covered no matter which sectors of the stock market do well. Conservative investors who prefer lower risk are likely better off avoiding investing in marijuana stocks.Most of the marijuana stocks mentioned above have fallen significantly over the past 12 months. This pattern underscores the risks that investors face and highlights why using margin to buy these stocks should be avoided. However, the factors causing poor performance (especially a supply-demand imbalance) should be resolved over time.Aggressive investors with high risk tolerances, though, will probably find a lot to like about marijuana stocks. The cannabis industry is still in its early stages. The market opportunities are enormous, especially as more U.S. states legalize cannabis. Investing in these stocks is a high-risk but potentially high-reward proposition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKeith Speights has positions in Innovative Industrial Properties.

Vanguard 500 Index Fund1. Vanguard 500 Index Fund\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVanguard created the index fund. If you\\'re looking for an S&P 500 index fund, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is hard to beat.It offers a dirt-cheap expense ratio of just 0.03%. That compares to a 0.78% average expense ratio for similar funds. This lower expense ratio means investors will pay just $3 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested with the fund, versus $78 in a typical competing fund.The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs (third in assets under management, or AUM). The ETF\\'s low-cost and large-size combination makes it a great choice if you\\'re looking to invest in the broader market. Because of its history, diversification, and exposure to blue chip stocks, many investors consider it one of the best ETFs to buy and hold.The S&P 500 has an excellent track record of delivering returns for investors. Over the last 50 years, the average stock market return as measured by the S&P 500 is 9.4%, with dividends reinvested. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a low-cost way to capture the market\\'s returns.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. Invesco QQQ Trust2. Invesco QQQ Trust\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re looking for exposure to big tech stocks, Invesco QQQ Trust is an excellent choice. The ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes 100 of the Nasdaq\\'s largest non-financial companies.The top stocks in the ETF are Apple (AAPL  -0.78%), Microsoft (MSFT  -2.61%), and Amazon (AMZN  -3.66%). It also boasts an affordable expense ratio of 0.2%. It\\'s one of the best-performing ETFs over the past decade. The Invesco QQQ Trust has generated a total return of more than 450% (17.6% annually), easily outpacing the S&P 500 at 220% (12.6% annually).The Nasdaq 100 suffered from a challenging bear market for most of 2022 but rallied sharply through mid-2023. Growth stocks tend to rise faster than the overall market in the early stages of a bull market.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Vanguard Growth ETF3. Vanguard Growth ETF\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGrowth stock investors had been licking their wounds for much of 2022. That\\\\u2019s because rising interest rates pressure growth stocks since they make the discount rate rise in financial models.If that downturn made you tired of trying to pick a growth stock winner when so few were delivering gains, you might want to invest in the Vanguard Growth ETF. The ETF holds large-cap growth stocks and tracks the CRSP US Large-Cap Growth Index. Like the Invesco QQQ Trust and the Vanguard 500 Index, the Vanguard Growth ETF\\'s biggest holdings are Apple and Microsoft. In addition, the growth-focused ETF holds many other growth stocks among its roughly 240 holdings.The Vanguard Growth ETF offers a rock-bottom expense ratio of just 0.04%. Its low cost makes it a good deal for anyone looking for a growth stock ETF.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4. iShares Core SP Small-Cap ETF4. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF provides broad exposure to small-cap stocks. Small caps tend to be more volatile than the broader market since they may not be profitable or as well-capitalized as their large-cap counterparts. As a result, small caps tend to be more at risk during a downturn because they may not have the same access to capital.The ETF helps mute some of that risk by owning a large basket of small caps. It held more than 600 stocks as of mid-2023. It has a fairly low concentration of holdings. Its top 10 holdings made up about 7.2% of the total.The ETF has a very low expense ratio, making it a low-cost way to add some small-cap exposure to your portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF5. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDividend stocks are great long-term investments. Over the last 50 years, dividend-paying companies have outperformed the broader market (9.2% average annual total return versus 7.7% for an equal-weighed S&P 500 Index). The best performance came from dividend growers and initiators (10.2% versus 6.6% for companies with no change in their dividend policy).The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF provides exposure to U.S. stocks with a history of growing their dividends. It held almost 450 dividend stocks as of mid-2023.The ETF offers a relatively attractive dividend yield. As of mid-2023, it had a trailing 12-month yield of 2.6%, more than the 1.5% dividend yield of an S&P 500 Index Fund. Thanks to its low expense ratio of 0.08%, investors get to keep more of the dividend income that the ETF produces. In addition, the fund should deliver price appreciation as the underlying companies grow their earnings and increase their dividends.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n6. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF6. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlthough the S&P 500 is considered a broad-market index, it only gives you exposure to 500 large-cap U.S. stocks. If you want to own all of the stocks on the U.S. market, the best way to do it is with a total stock market fund such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF. The fund holds roughly 4,000 stocks, including large caps, mid caps, and small caps. Because its holdings encompass the S&P 500, its largest holdings are the same as the broad market index.Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF aims to track the CRSP US Total Stock Market Index. Like other Vanguard funds, it has a low expense ratio of 0.03%, making it an affordable way to invest in the entire U.S. stock market through one ETF.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n7. iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF7. iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf it\\'s international markets you want, the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF is a good way to go. The fund derives its holdings from an MSCI global index and then subtracts the U.S. listings. It has roughly 4,300 stocks, including large caps, mid caps, and small caps from around the world.The ETF offers diversified international exposure. The fund\\'s top five holdings as of mid-2023 were:Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -2.56%): The Taiwanese information technology company makes up 1.6% of the fund\\'s holdings.Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY): The Swiss consumer staples company comprises 1.2% of the ETF\\'s holdings.ASML Holdings (ASML  -1.99%): The Netherlands-based semiconductor company makes up 1.1% of the fund\\'s holdings.Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF): The Korean electronics company makes up 1% of the fund\\'s holdings.Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY): The Chinese communications company makes up 1% of the ETF\\'s holdings.The fund allows investors to invest globally at an affordable expense ratio of 0.07%. It also had an attractive dividend yield of 2.3% as of mid-2023, based on dividend payments over the last 12 months.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSemiconductor\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA semiconductor is a basic element or compound substance that conducts electricity in certain situations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelated investing topics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to Invest in ETFs for Beginners\\\\n\\\\nExchange-traded funds let an investor buy lots of stocks and bonds at once.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nETF vs. Index Fund: What Are the Differences?\\\\n\\\\nYour investment style can dictate which kind of fund is best for your portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTop 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) ETFs in 2023\\\\n\\\\nIt may be smart to consider investing in one of these artificial intelligence-oriented ETFs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in Electric Vehicle ETFs\\\\n\\\\nWith the auto world switching to EVs, these exchange-traded funds can drive value.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre ETFs right for you?Are ETFs right for you?Exchange-traded funds can work for almost any kind of investor regardless of your investing style or the type of stocks you\\'re looking to invest in.There are hundreds of ETFs available that offer exposure to a wide range of sectors, as well as different kinds of investing goals such as dividends or growth. These funds can avoid some of the risk and volatility of investing in individual stocks at a very low cost. They\\'re also a good idea if there\\'s a sector you want to invest in but don\\'t know well enough to pick individual stocks.For most investors, holding at least one or two ETFs makes sense, especially if you want to eliminate some of the work of picking individual stocks.

Meanwhile, Vanguard has a relatively low minimum investment of $3,000.Vanguard also offers an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on investing in the 500 companies that comprise the S&P 500 index. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO  -1.34%) has a low minimum investment of one share ($415 as of March 14, 2023) and a low expense ratio of 0.3%.

The S&P 500 outperformed each fund slightly, as would be expected when accounting for each fund\\'s expense ratio.At the S&P 500\\'s rate of return, a $10,000 investment made five years ago would have grown into $17,866 by mid-2023. For comparison, a $10,000 investment in the Fidelity 500 Index Fund would have grown to $17,855 over the same five-year period, with that slight variation due to fees.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReturns\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReturns are the difference between the initial price of an asset and the dollar value that has been generated after ownership has ended.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith any of these three funds, you can expect your investment to deliver a performance that\\'s virtually identical to the S&P 500, less fees. Given its lower expense ratio, Fidelity\\'s S&P 500 index fund will likely continue to slightly outperform the funds from Schwab and Vanguard over the longer term.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhy are SP 500 index funds popular?Why are S&P 500 index funds popular?An index fund is designed to mirror the performance of a stock index. An S&P 500 index fund invests in each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC). It doesn\\'t try to outperform the index. Instead, it uses the index as its benchmark and aims to replicate its performance as closely as possible.S&P 500 funds are by far the most popular type of index fund. But index funds can be based on practically any financial market, investing strategy, or stock market sector.\\\\u00a0Index funds are popular with investors for a number of reasons. They offer easy portfolio diversification, with some funds providing broad exposure to hundreds or even thousands of stocks and bonds. You don\\'t risk losing all your money if one company collapses like you could with individual investments. However, you also don\\'t have as much upside potential to the astronomical returns that can result from picking a single huge winner.Index funds are passively managed, which means you\\'re not paying for someone to actively pick and choose investments. Passively managed funds result in a lower expense ratio from lower investment management fees compared to actively managed funds.Your money will track the market\\'s performance. Historically, the S&P 500\\'s annual returns have been in the 9% to 10% range. In some years, the index will lose value. For example, during the Great Recession, the S&P 500 lost about half of its value. Meanwhile, the index experienced a bear market starting in early 2022, declining by more than 20% from its peak by the fall. But over the long term, it\\'s always recovered. A 20-year investment has never resulted in a loss in the S&P 500\\'s history.You keep more of your investment profits in your pocket. S&P 500 index funds are low-cost investments. While active managers are likely to match or even beat the market\\'s performance over time, their fees eat away at your returns. Because they\\'re passive investments with low fees, S&P 500 index funds deliver returns that mirror the index\\'s returns over the long term.You\\'re investing in 500 of the most profitable companies in the U.S. The corporations represented in the S&P 500 are subject to stringent listing criteria. To join the index, a company must have a $14.6 billion market capitalization, and the sum of its past four quarters\\' earnings must be positive. Each company must also get approval from an index committee. The S&P 500\\'s largest holdings include Apple (AAPL  -0.78%), Amazon (AMZN  -3.66%), Microsoft(MSFT  -2.61%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  0.12%).You can put your investment decisions on autopilot. The S&P 500 has a flawless track record of delivering profits over long holding periods, allowing you to invest without worrying as much about stock market fluctuations. You also don\\'t have to research or follow individual companies. You can simply budget a certain amount and automatically invest it on a regular schedule. This practice is known as dollar-cost averaging. Even if you do pick individual stocks, S&P 500 funds are a good foundation for your investment portfolio since you\\'re guaranteed the returns of the stock market.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndex Funds vs Mutual Funds: What are the Differences?\\\\n\\\\nIndex funds and mutual funds both pool investors\\\\u2019 money to buy many different securities.

Leveraged ETFs use borrowed money and\\\\/or derivative securities to amplify investment returns or to bet against the index. For example, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF aims to return twice the index\\'s performance each day. So if the index rises by 2%, the ETF\\'s value rises by 4%. If the index falls by 3%, the ETF loses 6%.These leveraged products are intended to be day-trading instruments and have an inherent downside bias over the long term. In other words, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF over the long term will not return twice the index\\'s performance.Investing in S&P 500 index funds is one of the safest ways to build wealth over time. But leveraged ETFs -- even those that track the S&P 500 -- are highly risky and don\\'t belong in a long-term portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs on S&P 500 index funds\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the best S&P 500 index fund?\\\\n\\\\nangle-down\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nangle-up\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAll S&P 500 index funds strive to match the returns of the S&P 500 index less fees. Since fees are the difference-maker in returns, the Fidelity 500 Index Fund stands out as the best S&P 500 index fund because it has the lowest expense ratio of the top funds.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I buy an S&P 500 index fund?\\\\n\\\\nangle-down\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nangle-up\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can buy an S&P 500 index fund (or a similar exchange-traded fund on the S&P 500) at most brokerage accounts.

The only waste product is water vapor, making it a cleaner energy source than fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nImage source: Getty Images\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe drawback to hydrogen as a fuel source is that it\\\\u2019s rarely found in an easily extractable form like natural gas. And although hydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, most methods emit greenhouse gases. On top of that, it\\\\u2019s not yet made at the scale needed to be economically competitive with fossil fuels.However, that could change in the coming years. Several companies are working hard to tap into the enormous promise of this potentially emission-free fuel.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in hydrogenWhat to know about investing in hydrogenThere are several ways to produce hydrogen. Some methods result in the production of carbon dioxide as a byproduct. For example, the industry describes hydrogen obtained from burning natural gas as \\\\\"blue hydrogen.\\\\\" Using this form of hydrogen would require carbon capture and storage to trap and store the associated carbon dioxide underground to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.Another method uses renewable energy to power an electrolyzer that splits hydrogen from water molecules. This process produces \\\\\"green hydrogen,\\\\\" which results in no carbon emissions. Green and blue are two of the many colors used to classify hydrogen by its production method and emissions profile.Hydrogen fuel cells work much like batteries by generating electricity from an electrochemical reaction. Instead of being recharged like a traditional battery, hydrogen fuel cells are refueled with more hydrogen. We can use hydrogen fuel cells to motorize vehicles (cars, trains, buses, maritime vessels, and trucks) and as a stationary power source.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition Icon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCarbon Credits\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCarbon credits are tradeable permits that grant permission to emit a specific quantity of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSome advocates contend that hydrogen might eventually replace natural gas in the pipeline system with some modifications. It could then be used in power plants to generate electricity and as a fuel source for our homes. Because of its potential, some forecasts peg the future value of the clean hydrogen market to be as much as $10 trillion.\\\\u00a0Although clean hydrogen holds great promise as a potential emissions-free fuel source, it\\'s costly to produce. It costs about $1.50 per kilogram to produce hydrogen from natural gas and $5 per kilogram to produce clean hydrogen. The U.S. Department of Energy wants to get the cost of clean hydrogen down to $1.00 per kilogram over the next decade to make it a more competitive fuel source.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest hydrogen stocks to buyBest hydrogen stocks to buy in 2023Given the potential of clean hydrogen, a growing number of companies are getting into the sector. Many energy and industrial companies are in the early stages of exploring the possibility of hydrogen energy.However, a handful of companies are already starting to emerge as early leaders in the sector. Here are five leading hydrogen companies to keep an eye on as the industry matures:\\\\u00a0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData source: YCharts.

Air Products1. Air Products\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAir Products is one of the world leaders in supplying industrial gases. It\\'s a global leader in\\\\u00a0liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing technology and equipment. It\\'s also one of the world\\'s largest suppliers of merchant hydrogen and a leader in hydrogen fuel infrastructure. It has more than 100 hydrogen plants with the capacity to produce 7 million kilograms of the fuel each day.Air Products aspires to be a leader in providing solutions to the world\\'s energy and environmental challenges through gasification, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen. It has several major hydrogen projects underway that it expects to complete in the coming years. Its $7 billion carbon-free hydrogen joint venture in Saudi Arabia is the biggest. The project would use renewable energy to produce 650 tons per day when completed in 2025. The project and others under development position Air Products to remain a leading global hydrogen energy company.2. BP2. BP\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBP is a global oil and gas producer with grand lower-carbon energy ambitions. It set a goal to be a net-zero company by 2050 or earlier.Hydrogen is a crucial aspect of its strategy. BP intends to capture a 10% share of the hydrogen market in its core operating areas. That\\'s driving it to advance hydrogen projects across the U.K., Europe, the U.S., and Australia.For example, in the U.K., it\\'s developing plans to build that country\\'s largest blue hydrogen production plant (H2Tesside). It\\'s also developing HyGreen Tesside, a large-scale green hydrogen production facility. The projects could deliver 15% of the U.K.\\'s 2030 target for low-carbon hydrogen production.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3. Plug Power3. Plug Power\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPlug Power is a pioneer in the hydrogen fuel cell industry. It created the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cell technology. It has deployed an industry-leading 60,000 fuel cell systems for the e-mobility market (using electric powertrain technologies to power vehicles and fleets). It\\'s one of the world\\'s largest hydrogen buyers and operates a leading hydrogen refueling network in North America with over 180 fueling stations.Plug Power is building an end-to-end green hydrogen network to produce, store, and deliver the fuel across North America and Europe. It expects to produce 2,000 tons of green hydrogen per day by 2030. The company\\'s strategy of building the world\\'s first green hydrogen ecosystem positions Plug Power as a potential category leader in this massive market opportunity.4. Bloom Energy4. Bloom Energy\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBloom Energy\\'s mission is to make clean, reliable, and affordable energy. The company has developed the Bloom Energy Server, an electric power generation platform. It also created the Bloom Electrolyzer, using the same solid oxide technology as its Bloom Energy Server. This product can produce clean hydrogen 15% to 45% more efficiently than others on the market.Bloom Energy believes the Bloom Electrolyzer is a major leap forward for hydrogen. It hopes the technology will enable heavy industries such as steel, chemicals, cement, and glass manufacturing to decarbonize. Bloom Energy can pair its Bloom Electrolyzer with solar energy and\\\\u00a0wind energy\\\\u00a0to generate green hydrogen, which it can store and eventually turn back into electricity for future use.\\\\u00a05. Linde5. Linde\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLinde has developed several technologies to efficiently compress and safely refuel hydrogen. It also offers technologies to lower the carbon emissions of hydrogen through carbon capture and storage.In 2023, the company agreed to invest $1.8 billion to supply clean energy to a large-scale blue ammonia plant in Texas. Linde plans to build the carbon capture infrastructure needed to sequester more than 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, offsetting the emissions of the hydrogen supplied to the plant. It signed a deal with oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM  0.17%) to transport and permanently store the captured carbon dioxide. The company expects the project to start in 2025.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelated investing topics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in Energy Stocks\\\\n\\\\nThe economy needs energy across sectors to run smoothly, making these companies potential buys.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRenewable Energy Dividend Stocks\\\\n\\\\nGoing green is the future of energy.

AbbVie\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDrugmaker AbbVie\\\\u00a0has had an excellent dividend track record since its spinoff from\\\\u00a0Abbott Labs (ABT  0.06%) in 2013. From its inception through early 2023, AbbVie has increased its payout by a whopping 270%. AbbVie has carried on the dividend growth legacy inherited from Abbott by boosting its payout every year.Although AbbVie will lose its patent-protected exclusivity for the top-selling drug Humira in 2023, newer products like\\\\u00a0Rinvoq and Skyrizi should help cushion the blow. Because of that, it\\'s in excellent shape to keep the dividend income flowing and growing.\\\\u00a02. AvalonBay Communities\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs one of the largest apartment owners in the country, AvalonBay benefits from collecting steady rental income to support its high-yielding payout. The real estate investment trust (REIT) also boasts a top-tier financial profile. The company\\'s financial strength allows it to expand its apartment portfolio by developing and acquiring new communities.While the company hasn\\'t increased its payout every year, AvalonBay has grown its dividend at a 5% annual rate since its 1994 initial public offering (IPO), including by 3.8% in early 2023. With demand for apartments continuing to grow, the REIT should be able to keep increasing its dividend in the coming years.3. Brookfield Infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBrookfield Infrastructure\\\\u00a0operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure businesses focused on\\\\u00a0utilities, transportation,\\\\u00a0energy midstream, and data. The businesses generate relatively stable cash flow to support its growing dividend. The infrastructure stock delivered its 14th straight year of increasing its payout in early 2023.Brookfield envisions increasing its dividend at a 5% to 9% annual rate over the long term, powered by the organic growth of its existing businesses and acquisitions. The company\\'s organic growth drivers of inflation-linked rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects should grow its funds from operations (FFO) by 6% to 9% per share over the long term. Meanwhile, future acquisitions will further pad its bottom line. The company acquired a European data center platform and a global container leasing company in 2023.4. Brookfield Renewable\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBrookfield Renewable\\\\u00a0is a sibling company of Brookfield Infrastructure. Brookfield Corporation\\\\u00a0(BN  -0.03%) controls both companies. This Brookfield entity focuses on\\\\u00a0renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind, solar, and energy storage facilities. The assets generate steady cash flow backed by long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and other end users, supporting Brookfield\\'s high-yield dividend.The company also expects to increase its payout at a 5% to 9% annual pace over the long term. Powering that forecast is its organic growth drivers \\\\u2014 including an extensive pipeline of new renewable energy projects \\\\u2014 plus additional acquisitions. Brookfield Renewable has already secured and funded at least 8% annual funds from operations (FFO) per share growth through 2027.5. Duke Energy\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDuke Energy is a leading utility. The company\\'s electric utilities serve 8.2 million customers across six states, while its natural gas utilities provide gas to 1.6 million customers across five states. Its businesses generate very stable cash flows backed by government-regulated rate structures.Duke has a large-scale investment program underway to expand its transformation and distribution network. These investments should grow its earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually through 2027. The earnings growth should enable the utility to continue growing its dividend.Dividend Stocks 6-106. Crown Castle International\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCrown Castle is a REIT focused on owning communications infrastructure in the U.S., including cell towers, small cells, and fiber optic networks. Its infrastructure is crucial to supporting the mobile industry\\'s next-generation network: 5G. Crown Castle sees a decades-long opportunity to invest in new 5G-related infrastructure. That should drive 7% to 8% annual dividend growth over the long term. It has grown its dividend payment at a 9% compound annual rate since 2016.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n7. ChevronThe big oil giant\\'s top financial priority is to sustain and grow its dividend. The company delivered its 36th consecutive annual dividend increase in 2023, one of the longest streaks among oil stocks. Chevron has grown its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate over the last 15 years. Chevron\\'s integrated operations, low-cost oil business, and lower-carbon energy investments position it to sustain and grow its dividend in future years.8. Enbridge\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCanadian oil pipeline giant Enbridge has been an outstanding dividend stock over the years. It has paid dividends for more than 68 years, including expanding its payout in each of the past 28 years.While the world is transitioning its fuel supply from oil to cleaner alternatives, Enbridge is adapting by investing in infrastructure to support natural gas projects and offshore wind farms. The investments have the company on track to increase its cash flow per share by a mid-single-digit annual rate for the next several years, which should support continued dividend growth.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n9. Enterprise Products Partners\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEnterprise Products Partners\\\\u00a0ranks as one of the top players in the\\\\u00a0midstream oil and gas market. The master limited partnership (MLP) has increased its payout for almost a quarter century.While the company currently focuses on fossil fuels, it formed an evolutionary technology group in 2021 to pursue opportunities in the energy transition. The future investments should give Enterprise the fuel to continue increasing its dividend.10. Gilead Sciences\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGilead Sciences\\\\u00a0pays one of the most attractive dividends in the biotechnology sector. The company has a solid dividend track record, increasing its payout every year since it initiated one in 2015. Its strong HIV franchise is the biotech\\'s anchor.However, Gilead has also been able to cash in on its antiviral treatment Remdesivir, one of the few approved treatments for COVID-19. It has several other promising drugs in the pipeline that should drive continued sales growth in the future.Dividend Stocks 11-1511. Blackstone\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLeading alternative asset manager Blackstone has a unique dividend policy. The company returns almost all of its earnings to investors via dividends and share repurchases. Because of that, its dividend payment changes each quarter as its earnings fluctuate. However, the overall payment has steadily risen over the years, along with Blackstone\\'s earnings.12. Regions Financial\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRegions Financial is one of the country\\'s largest banks, focusing on the South and Midwest. Regions Financial has a long history of paying dividends. While the company reset its payment level during the 2008-09 financial crisis, it has increased the dividend 20-fold since that time. \\\\u00a013. Extra Space Storage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExtra Space Storage is a REIT focused on owning, operating, and managing self-storage facilities. The company has been one of the best-performing stocks in the REIT sector over the past decade. A big driver is its rapidly rising dividend. Extra Space Storage has increased its payout by almost 550% over the last 10 years.14. 3M\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3M has been a phenomenal dividend stock. The industrial conglomerate has paid dividends for more than a century, including increasing its payout in each of the past 65 straight years. As such, it\\'s a Dividend King, a company with 50 or more years of consecutive dividend increases. The company\\'s strategy of investing in new products has driven that steady growth. It has expanded its sales and enabled 3M to keep increasing its dividend.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n15. PfizerPfizer\\\\u00a0has paid dividends for roughly 340 consecutive quarters. The pharmaceutical giant\\'s investments in research and development are paying off. The company developed one of the first vaccines against COVID-19 and followed that up with a successful oral treatment. The commercial successes have enabled Pfizer to continue making research and development (R&D) investments and strategic acquisitions that should increase its cash flow in the future. Pfizer should continue to generate plenty of cash to fund future dividends.Dividend Stocks 16-2016. VICI Properties\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVICI Properties is a REIT focusing on owning experiential real estate like casinos. The company leases those properties back to operating companies under long-term triple net leases (NNN). The agreements supply it with steadily rising rental income from annual rate increases. The company also steadily invests in new gaming and non-gaming real estate. VICI Properties\\' growing income has enabled it to increase its dividend in all five years since its formation.17. Realty Income\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRealty Income lives up to its name. The REIT, which pays a monthly dividend, has made more than 635 consecutive payments. Even better, it has increased its payout more than 100 times since its initial public offering in 1994, expanding it at a 4.4% compound annual rate. That adds up to more than 25 consecutive years.Driving that growth has been a steady diet of acquisitions. Realty Income purchases single-tenant properties in sale-leaseback transactions, acquires larger property portfolios, and merges with other REITs to grow its portfolio, rental income, and dividend.\\\\u00a018. Verizon Communications\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTelecommunications giant Verizon has been a great income stock over the years. The company delivered its 16th consecutive annual dividend increase in 2022, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. Verizon should be able to continue increasing its dividend as it invests to transition its mobile network to 5G, bringing faster data speeds to its customers.19. Walgreens Boots Alliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPharmacy giant Walgreens has paid dividends for more than 90 years, expanding its payout in each of the past 47. The company expects the streak to continue. It\\'s steadily transforming into a consumer-centric healthcare company that should accelerate its earnings growth. The strategy should enable the company to continue increasing its payout.20. W.P. Carey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nW.P. Carey is a REIT that owns a diversified real estate portfolio. The company has an excellent dividend track record and has increased its payout each year since its IPO in 1998. Behind that steady growth has been W.P. Carey\\'s ability to steadily expand its portfolio of cash-flowing commercial real estate. With a solid financial profile, the REIT has the flexibility to keep growing in the coming years.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRelated investing topics\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInvesting in Dividend Stocks\\\\n\\\\nThese companies pay their shareholders regularly, making them good sources of income.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDividend Achievers List\\\\n\\\\nThese companies have at least 10 years of dividend growth.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDividend Kings of 2023\\\\n\\\\nThese companies have increased their dividends every year for 50+ years.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow Often Are Dividends Paid on Stocks?\\\\n\\\\nHow often can you expect to be paid a dividend on stocks?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGreat income now, more laterAll 20 of these dividend stocks offer an above-average yield, making them stand out in a time when many companies don\\'t pay very high dividends.

You\\'ve come to the right place.Our experts have compared hundreds of credit cards (216 at last count) to bring you the handful that we think are the best credit cards.And unlike other sites, we\\'re not just putting cards in front of you that we\\'ve been paid to put on our page. We recommend these cards because these are the cards we would (and do!) recommend to our friends and family, and many are the credit cards we use ourselves -- as you\\'ll see in our first-hand reviews below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Best Credit CardsIf you\\'re short on time, here\\'s a list of 5 of our top-rated credit card picks:Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card (see rates and fees): Our experts\\' top overall pick. We love the unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases, which is an industry-leading rewards rate for uncomplicated flat-rate rewards. It also currently has a $200 cash rewards offer. And there\\'s no annual fee.Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back (see rates and fees): We think this has the highest cash back potential for cards with no annual fee. The key is the Cashback Match -- Discover will match new cardholders\\' cash back earned in the first year -- plus the 5% cash back on quarterly rotating categories (up to the quarterly maximum when you activate) and 1% on other purchases.Wells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card (see rates and fees): If you need a long period of 0% introductory interest for both purchases and balance transfers, this is our favorite. This card has no annual fee and offers 0% intro APR, 21 months from account opening and 0% intro APR, 21 months from account opening on qualifying balance transfers. The balance transfer fee here is 5%; min: $5. (After the intro 0% period, the go-to rate of 18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR applies).Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (see rates and fees): This card is our pick for its generous welcome bonus and premium rewards. New card members earn 75,000 miles once you spend $4,000 in the first 3 months. That\\'s $750 when traveling! There is an annual fee of $95 but the many redemption options, plus no foreign transaction fees, make this card worth it.Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card: Our top pick for travel rewards with no annual fee. It\\'s simply a card that packs in a lot. You get 1.5 points per dollar, plus a welcome offer of 25,000 points. And again, that\\'s with no annual fee. This can be a fantastic card if you\\'re looking for a 0% interest offer, but don\\'t need the absolute longest on the market. (After the intro 0% period, the go-to rate of 18.24% - 28.24% (Variable) applies).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJump to more of our expert picks:\\\\n\\\\nOur pick for best credit card overallBest credit cards for 0% intro balance transfersBest credit card for rewards with 0% interestBest credit cards for cash backBest credit cards for travelBest credit cards for building credit (including a student credit card)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest credit cards of October 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow The List [+]\\\\nHide The List [-]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRotating high cash back categories plus first-year cash back match:\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOverall top credit card with simple cash rewards:\\\\n\\\\nWells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlat-rate cash back:\\\\n\\\\nCiti\\\\u00ae Double Cash Card \\\\u2013 18 month BT offer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong matching 0% introductory offers:\\\\n\\\\nWells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong 0% introductory offers and no late fees or penalty rates:\\\\n\\\\nCiti Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% offer plus rotating bonus category cash back:\\\\n\\\\nChase Freedom Flex\\\\u2120\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoints on your everyday spend:\\\\n\\\\nCapital One Venture Rewards Credit Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTravel rewards with no annual fee:\\\\n\\\\nBank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEarning high cash back while building credit:\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Student Cash Back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEarning cash back while rebuilding credit:\\\\n\\\\nBank of America\\\\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Secured credit card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRatings Methodology\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApply Now  for Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back\\\\n\\\\nOn\\\\nDiscover\\'s\\\\nSecure Website.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates & Fees \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare This Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back\\\\n\\\\nGreat for: Rotating high cash back categories plus first-year cash back match\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApply Now  for Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back\\\\n\\\\nOn\\\\nDiscover\\'s\\\\nSecure Website.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates & Fees \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5.00 stars\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

At The Motley Fool Ascent, we do the same for credit cards and your personal finances.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve been part of The Motley Fool since 2006, helping our readers make more and save more through investing and their personal finances. I get excited about what most others find dreadfully boring. Specifically, when a credit card says \\\\\"terms apply,\\\\\" I\\'m actually reading those terms. All of them. I\\'ve been juggling multiple credit cards for decades to maximize rewards, and I\\'ve held credit cards on multiple continents.Of the cards we list on this page, I personally currently use or have in the past used some of them (many of my teammates at The Ascent use the others we list).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur pick for best overall credit cardChoosing a great credit card being easier than you think -- and the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card is proof of that.Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae CardFlat-rate 2% cash rewards on spending$200 welcome offer (after spending $500 in first three months)No annual feeWith the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card you earn 2% cash rewards on your spending. No juggling cards, no figuring out rewards systems. You spend at the grocery store: 2%. At the vet: 2%. Paying for Netflix: 2%. It\\\\u2019s really that easy.Better still, this card has a welcome offer of $200 after you spend $500 in the first three months of card ownership.And that\\'s all for a card with no annual fee, meaning that as long as you pay your credit card statements in full and on time (and we suggest that you do), you\\'ll pay no ongoing fee for owning this card and earning cash rewards with it.The perks on the card aren\\\\u2019t as extensive as a card that carries an annual fee, but hey, we like no annual fee. Still, you do get cell phone protection of up to $600 covering damage or theft (terms apply here) and Wells Fargo\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cCredit Close-Up\\\\u201d that provides your FICO score monthly (enrollment required for this one).In all, this card is proof that it doesn\\\\u2019t need to be complicated to find a great credit card.Apply for the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card (on Wells Fargo\\'s website)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur first-hand experience\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I got this card originally for the 0% introductory APR offer and the cash-back rewards and bonus. (Editor\\'s note: The Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card card offers 0% APR for 15 months on purchases and qualifying balance transfers; after that, the go-to 20.24%, 25.24%, or 29.99% variable APR applies.) I was taking on a home renovation project and thought that both the 0% APR period and cash rewards could help with our costs. I ended up keeping it for the cell phone protection feature.\\\\\"Rachel Zinanti, team member at The Motley Fool Ascent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe 2 best credit cards for balance transfers with a long 0% introductory offerIf you have credit card debt and are currently paying interest on that debt, getting a credit card with a 0% introductory balance transfer offer \\\\u2013 or, better still, a paired 0% purchases and balance transfer offer \\\\u2013 can give you some space from paying interest while you work down that credit card debt.Our top pick: Wells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card0% introductory APR for 21 months on balance transfers (after that, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR rate applies)0% introductory APR for 21 months on purchases (after that, the go-to 18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR rate applies)No annual feeThe Wells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card also makes this list because of its matching 0% introductory offers for 21 months on balance transfers and purchases. This is another card with no annual fee, which is ideal when you\\\\u2019re trying to pay down credit card debt or generally avoid interest. But if you are thinking specifically about a balance transfer, this card does have a balance transfer fee of 5%; min: $5.One thing I do like about a lot of the Wells Fargo cards, and Wells Fargo Reflect Card has this feature as well, is the $600 in cell phone protection against damage or theft (terms apply here). It\\\\u2019s a perk that you don\\\\u2019t see on most cards.Apply for the Wells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card (on Wells Fargo\\'s website)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nMatching 0% offers\\\\n\\\\nMatching 0% offers may seem nice to have, but they\\'re more advantageous than you might guess. If you carry a balance on a credit card, you lose your grace period. The grace period is that wonderful feature that if you pay your balance in full every month, you don\\\\u2019t accrue any interest on new purchases until after your due date. But, if you carry a balance, you lose that grace period, and new purchases begin accruing interest immediately. If you have matching 0% intro offers on balance transfers and purchases, you don\\\\u2019t have to worry about that, because your new purchases will be interest-free thanks to the 0% offer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlternative to this cardAlso good: Citi Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card0% introductory APR for 21 months on balance transfers (after which the go-to regular APR applies)0% introductory APR for 12 months on purchases (followed by the same go-to rate)Balance transfer fee: 3% ($5 min) for first 4 months, then 5% ($5 min.)The Citi Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card also offers 21 months of 0% introductory interest on balance transfers, is also a no-annual-fee card, and does not apply penalty rates for missed payments. The balance transfer fee here also gives you a bit of a break for the first four months, after which it rises. What\\\\u2019s nice about the Citi Simplicity Card is that there is that there\\\\u2019s also no fee for late payments \\\\u2013 a nice complement to the no penalty rate feature. That said, we strongly recommend that you make payments on time, even with these features.Where the Citi Simplicity Card lags is the intro 0% purchase offer. That\\\\u2019s at 12 months, which is considerably shorter than the 21 months of the balance transfer offer (again, the go-to regular APR applies to purchases after the introductory offer). Maybe not that big of a deal, especially if you\\\\u2019re just focused on the balance transfer offer, but it\\\\u2019s worth noting.Apply for the Citi Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card (on Citi\\'s website)Who shouldn\\\\u2019t get these cardsIf you don\\\\u2019t have credit card debt and you\\\\u2019re not in a position where you need a period of 0% interest on new purchases, then these aren\\\\u2019t the cards for you. Many top cards also include 0% introductory offers, which is fine. But if you don\\\\u2019t need a 0% offer, focus on other card categories instead.Additionally, if you could benefit from a 0% interest offer, but don\\\\u2019t need the absolute longest period of 0%, then you can typically get a better all-around card by using a shorter 0% introductory offer. And if this sounds like you, just read on \\\\u2013 those cards are next.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe best 0% credit card with rewardsI tend to be strict when thinking about 0% credit cards. If you have credit card debt, focus on paying that down, worry about rewards later.You\\\\u2019re going to save so much in interest and make your financial life so much easier by not having credit card debt hanging over you. It just makes sense to make eliminating that debt a priority.But, is there a world where you can have both? Actually, there is. If you don\\\\u2019t have an overwhelming amount of credit card debt, then the best credit cards for rewards also offer solid 0% term lengths and welcome offers.Our top pick: Chase Freedom Flex\\\\u21200% introductory APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers (after which the go-to variable rate applies)5% cash back rewards on rotating bonus categories (activation required)$200 welcome offer (after spending $500 in the first 3 months )The Chase Freedom Flex\\\\u2120 is a very close second. There are similar things to like: it has matching 0% intro APR offers for 15 months, a balance transfer fee of Either $5 or 5% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater. , no annual fee, a $200 welcome offer, and an attractive rewards program.The Chase Freedom Flex rewards program isn\\\\u2019t as simple as the flat cash rewards, but some people may actually like it more. There are rotating categories each quarter like gas, grocery stores (excluding Walmart and Target), and Amazon and Lowe\\'s. If you activate the category for your card, you earn 5% back on purchases in that category for the period that it\\\\u2019s active. But on a regular basis, you\\\\u2019re also earning 3% on dining at restaurants, takeout, eligible delivery services, and drugstores. And then it\\\\u2019s 1% back on everything else.Apply for the Chase Freedom Flex\\\\u2120 (on Chase\\'s website)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nHow do you know if a shorter 0% offer is right for you?\\\\n\\\\nI obviously don\\\\u2019t know you so I can\\\\u2019t tell you for sure. But, you can do some simple math to help figure out whether you can use a shorter 0% period and still get out of credit card debt. Just take the amount of debt you have and divide by the amount you can realistically pay towards that debt every month. That\\\\u2019ll give the you the least number of months you\\\\u2019ll need in the 0% offer. For example, if you have $3,000 in credit card debt and can pay $200 per month, then you would need a 0% balance transfer offer of at least 15 months (and it\\\\u2019s even better to give yourself two to three months of cushion). The same math works if you are using a 0% on purchases offer to make a big purchase. If it\\'s a $3,000 purchase and you can pay $200 month, then you need at least 15 months of 0% interest on purchases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWho shouldn\\\\u2019t get these cardsIf you don\\\\u2019t have credit card debt, these could still be great cards for you. However, if you don\\\\u2019t have a need for a 0% introductory offer, you are probably well served to look at other card categories, rather than being limited to cards that have a 0% intro offer.And if you have significant credit card debt or you just don\\\\u2019t think that you can realistically pay down your debt in the length of time offered by these cards, then you may be better off opting for the cards with the longest 0% intro offers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe 2 best credit cards for cash back rewardsOur pick for simple cash back: Citi\\\\u00ae Double Cash Card \\\\u2013 18 month BT offerFlat-rate 2% cash back on spending (1% when you make a purchase and 1% when you pay your bill)No cap on the amount of cash back you can earnNo annual feeThe Citi\\\\u00ae Double Cash Card \\\\u2013 18 month BT offer card is nearly as simple and worth checking out. The rewards program is just a wee bit more complicated \\\\u2013 you get 1% cash back when you make a purchase and 1% when you pay your bill, rather than just getting the 2% all at once. But that isn\\\\u2019t a big deal. More notable is that there\\\\u2019s currently no welcome bonus on the card.Apply for the Citi\\\\u00ae Double Cash Card \\\\u2013 18 month BT offer (on Citi\\'s website)These cards live somewhere in the Goldilocks zone between flat-rate cash back cards and travel rewards cards. They aren\\\\u2019t as simple as flat-rate cards, nor are they as complicated as travel rewards cards. At the same time, they\\\\u2019re potentially more rewarding than flat-rate cards, but typically a bit less so than travel cards.Before we compare credit cards, I think it\\\\u2019s also worth noting that, like travel rewards cards, these cards will generally serve you the best when you pair them with other cards to get the most cash back across the most categories.Our top pick for tiered and bonus category cash back: Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back5% cash back on rotating categories like grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations (up to quarterly maximum of $1,500; activation required)Unlimited cash back match at the end of the first yearNo annual feeLeading the pack for these cards is the Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back. This card has a rotating bonus category, which means that it has a different category each quarter that earns a high 5% cash back rate on spending (up to $1,500 in purchases, and note that you have to activate the bonus category). These categories include grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations.But as good as that 5% is on its own, at the end of your first year of card ownership Discover matches all of the cash back that you\\'ve earned in that time. So after the first year of owning the card, you\\'ll essentially have earned double that first year\\'s rate of cash back.Spending outside of the bonus category is just 1% cash back (though remember, that gets matched 1-for-1 at the end of the first year, too), but the fact that this is a no-annual-fee card makes it pretty valuable overall, especially in year one.Apply for the Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back (on Discover\\'s website)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur first-hand experience\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"I\\'ve had the Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back card for three years, and give it top scores across the board. Beyond the 1% cash back on every purchase, I\\'ve found the quarterly 5% cash-back offers are set up really well to help me max out the cash back benefits. The app and website are easy to use, the fraud protection is helpful, and I\\'ve only had a few merchants over these three years not accept Discover.\\\\\"Allyson Wines, Head of Marketing at The Motley Fool\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe 2 best credit cards for racking up big travel rewardsYou can\\\\u2019t have a list of the best credit cards of 2023 without featuring cards that can be used to rack up serious points and access quality perks. These cards take a bit of work to get the most value, but if you\\\\u2019re willing to do that work, it can really pay off.I will note that while you can certainly use a single card from this list, if you\\\\u2019re going the direction of rewards maximization, the best credit cards for travel typically work well when paired with other cards to get the most rewards across the most categories.Our top pick: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit CardUnlimited 2 miles per $1 spent5 miles per $1 spent on hotels and rental cars through Capital One Travel75,000 miles bonus offer (after spending $4,000 within the first 3 months)The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is our top pick and was the anchor card in my wallet for a long time. (See rates and fees.) It\\\\u2019s simply a great card that allows you to earn a solid 2 miles per $1 spent across all of your spending, plus 5 miles per $1 on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Miles can be used to reimburse yourself for travel you\\\\u2019ve paid for and is on your card statement. You can also use them to book travel through Capital One Travel. Or you can transfer them to Capital One travel partners like Air France KLM, British Airways, and Virgin Red.There\\\\u2019s a $95 annual fee, but there\\\\u2019s also an impressive 75,000 miles offer when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months of having the account. There are a number of nice perks like Capital One lounge visits, a $100 credit for TSA PreCheck, no foreign transaction fees, rental car coverage, and extended warranty coverage.I mentioned above that this used to be in my wallet. Why not anymore? It was a lifestyle change. We had kiddos enter the picture, which meant less travel, which meant less utility from the card. But this will be top of my list when that changes again, especially if it has a welcome bonus like the current one.Apply for the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (on Capital One\\'s website)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur first-hand experience\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"At the time I used the Capital One Venture Card I was busy, but also traveling a lot. So it was really the perfect card because it has great travel-focused rewards and perks, but also is easy to get value from the card. We were also doing a lot of international travel at the time, and the no foreign transaction fee was crucial -- credit card was time and again the easiest way to pay in countries around the world, and getting solid exchange rates without the extra fee on top made it practical to use this card from Casablanca to Kyoto.\\\\\"Matt Koppenheffer, General Manager, The Motley Fool Ascent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlso good: Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card1.5 points per dollar 25,000 points (that\\'s 25,000 online bonus points after you make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening - that can be a $250 statement credit toward travel purchases)No annual feeThe Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card is proof that you can have a great travel rewards card with no annual fee.Yes, when you pay an annual fee for a travel rewards card (like the ones above) you can expect somewhat higher everyday rewards rates and certain extra perks. There\\'s also generally a beefy welcome bonus.But with the Bank of America Travel Rewards you get a very solid 1.5 points per dollar on your everyday spending. Plus, there\\'s a current welcome bonus of 25,000 points.And remember, if you are a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member, the rewards rate bumps up between 25% and 75%.There\\'s also no foreign transaction fee. Which may seem obvious for a travel credit card, but some travel cards do have a foreign transaction fee (so pay attention!).Finally, though it\\'s not the focus of this section, there is an offer of 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases and 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days. So you can not only get travel rewards with no annual fee, but secure a 0% interest offer at the same time. (Note that after the 0% introductory period, the go-to rate, currently 18.24% - 28.24% (Variable), applies).I don\\'t use this card specifically, but have a very similar Bank of America card and wouldn\\'t give it up. Especially for those that already bank with Bank of America and qualify for Preferred Rewards, these cards have to make the list to consider.Apply for the Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card (on Bank of America\\'s website)Who shouldn\\\\u2019t get these cardsTravel cards typically aren\\\\u2019t set-it-and-forget-it credit cards. Many have annual fees, so you should make sure you\\\\u2019re actually making the most of them if you\\\\u2019re paying that fee. If you want a simple credit card experience, it\\\\u2019s hard to say that these would be the best credit cards for you.If you want a simpler rewards experience, consider cards with simple cash-back rewards.These also tend to be heavily geared towards people who travel and dine out a lot. When I had babies enter the picture, I found that my travel cards were suddenly less valuable. They\\\\u2019re still solid credit cards even if you\\\\u2019re not a big traveler, but you\\\\u2019re just not going to get as much value as someone who\\\\u2019s traveling and eating out a lot.If you want higher rewards without less travel focus, consider tiered or bonus-category cash back cards.If you don\\\\u2019t think you\\\\u2019ll consistently be able to pay your credit card in full and on time every month, I wouldn\\\\u2019t suggest focusing on this category. Paying off your credit card in full every month is always a good idea, but even more so when you\\\\u2019re paying an annual fee and trying to maximize the value of earning rewards. Paying interest on card balances eats away very quickly at any value these cards bring.If you could benefit from 0% interest for a big purchase or to help pay down credit card debt, consider cards with long 0% APR introductory offers or cards with 0% APR intro offers and rewards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe 2 best cards for building and rebuilding creditIf you have a poor credit history or have little or no credit history at all (for example, if you\\\\u2019re still a student), qualifying for a lot of the cards on this page can be difficult, if not impossible. The good news is that there are cards that will help you build your credit and offer some nice features as well.Our top pick: Bank of America\\\\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Secured credit card3% cash back on a category of your choice and 2% on grocery stores and wholesale clubs (up to $2,500 in combined spend per quarter)Unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchasesNo annual feeClose on the heels of that card is the Bank of America\\\\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Secured credit card. Here\\\\u2019s another secured credit card that can help you build credit, but also lets you earn cash-back rewards. And the rates of cash back are generous at 3% for your choice of a category like gas, dining, or online shopping; 2% for grocery stores and wholesale clubs; and 1% everywhere else. There is a limit on the amount of spend for the 2% and 3% rewards rates, but it\\\\u2019s a relatively high max of $2,500 per quarter.The card has no annual fee, and you get free access to your FICO score. Bank of America will periodically review accounts to see if they qualify to be bumped up out of a secured card, but they don\\\\u2019t define specifically when that review happens. A security deposit of at least $200 is required here.Apply for the Bank of America\\\\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards Secured credit card (on Bank of America\\'s website)Student cardsThough they also serve people without top-notch credit, the best student credit cards tend to be a bit of a step up from secured cards. Likely because card issuers are aiming for a good first impression to try to win lasting customers.In any case, rewards are often a bit better, there may be welcome bonuses, there\\\\u2019s rarely a security deposit of any sort, and you might even find a 0% introductory offer.It\\\\u2019s once again Discover and Bank of America that lead the way in this category. And once again, Discover gets our top marks.Our top pick for students: Discover it\\\\u00ae Student Cash Back5% cash back on rotating categories like grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations (up to quarterly maximum of $1,500, activation required)Unlimited cash back match at the end of the first yearNo annual feeThe Discover it\\\\u00ae Student Cash Back is a wonderful card in large part because it looks so much like the Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back. There\\\\u2019s no annual fee, and users earn 5% cash back in rotating categories like Amazon.com, grocery stores, and restaurants (up to the quarterly maximum of $1,500).But the best part is that Discover matches all of the cash back you\\'ve earned at the end of the first year. That effectively makes the base 1% cash back rate 2% during that first year. And the higher 5% bonus rate becomes a whopping 10%.We\\\\u2019re financially focused, so we\\\\u2019re not the place that\\\\u2019s going to tell you to pick a financial product based on style. That said, the Discover it\\\\u00ae Student Cash Back does offer a selection of nice designs, so students are not carrying something that\\\\u2019s the same old boring blue or silver of most standard cards.Apply for the Discover it\\\\u00ae Student Cash Back (on Discover\\'s website)Who shouldn\\\\u2019t get these cardsWell, this is pretty simple. If you have fair, good, or excellent credit, you will qualify for cards that are better than the secured cards and you won\\\\u2019t have to pay a security deposit. So if that\\'s you, you should probably check out our other categories.And, if you\\\\u2019re not a student, well \\\\u2026 you\\\\u2019re not going to qualify for the best student credit cards with most issuers. Plus, again, if you have good credit, you\\\\u2019ll likely be able to find a better card than a student card anyway.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFind the best credit card for your needs\\\\n\\\\nCompare credit card bonuses, rewards, fees, and more using our side-by-side comparison tool.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStart comparing cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow we picked these cards (Methodology)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCredit cards don\\'t end up on our list of the best credit cards by luck.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s not a single methodology that we use to pick cards for this page. Just as the different types of cards are good fits for different types of people, a one-sized-fits-all methodology doesn\\'t work for all of these types of cards.We break up the large field of credit cards into three main groups for the purposes of analysis and ratings:Rewards-type cards: These are standard cards (i.e. not for credit-building or students) whose primary value is in the rewards they provide. Travel rewards cards, flat-rate cash back cards, tiered cash-back cards, store credit cards, airline credit cards, and hotel credit cards are a few of the sub-types that fall into this group.0% APR introductory offer cards: These are cards where the most valuable feature is the 0% APR introductory offer. The primary groups that fall under this heading are 0% balance transfer cards and 0% purchases cards.Credit-building cards: These are cards whose main feature is that they\\'re accessible to people who have a poor credit history or little or no credit history.We have slightly different methodologies to determine how cards get rated across each of these categories.Rewards cardsWith rewards cards we are focused on rewards (naturally). Cards score points for the overall value of their rewards program as well as the value of their welcome offer, if they have one. We ding cards for having an annual fee, and ding them more for a higher annual fee (though we\\'ll readily note that sometimes fee-bearing cards have perks or rewards that easily make the annual fee worth it). We add more points if the card has perks that many people will get value from -- and the more valuable perks, the more we bump the score.0% APR introductory offer cardsWith these cards, the main value to users is the length of the 0% intro APR period, so we give points for longer 0% periods (both purchases and balance transfers). We also give points for matching 0% periods -- when the 0% lengths match it typically gives the user most flexibility and value. We also award cards for lower balance transfer fees, since this lowers the total cost to users who do transfer a balance. And though we don\\'t focus on rewards or other perks when it comes to 0% cards -- the focus is using them to help avoid expensive credit card debt -- we do give cards points for good rewards programs, welcome offers, and valuable perks. Users that can pay down their debt with shorter 0% periods often do have the opportunity to choose from cards that have both the 0% introductory offer and rewards, welcome offers, and perks.Credit-building cardsThese cards also have specific usage, and that\\'s to help the users build or re-build their credit. The main benefit off the top with these cards is that they do accept users with limited credit history or a poor credit history (though they do sometimes require a security deposit). This group includes student cards, since students often have a limited credit history, or no credit history at all. These cards are typically more stripped down, but we score these cards based on the perks and features that they do offer, which may include limited rewards systems, providing FICO credit scores, or even in some cases (mostly student cards as opposed to secured cards) 0% introductory offers.The most important part is youA five star card is only as good as how it fits into your life, financial picture and needs though.

Go to AnnualCreditReport.com to request it.Once you have your credit reports, review them for errors that could be damaging your credit score. If you find any errors, visit the website of the credit bureau that issued the report to file a dispute.Get a credit cardThe easiest way to improve your credit is by using a credit card and paying the bill on time.

While this isn\\'t necessary for your credit score, it\\'s a way to avoid interest charges on your credit card purchases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Picks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCard\\\\nRating\\\\nGreat For\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5.00 stars\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

With credit cards, the APR is the same as the interest rate.Balance: The amount owed on a credit card, including all unpaid transactions and fees. The balance at the end of a statement period is called the statement balance.Balance transfer: Moving a balance from one credit card to another. This is usually done when the new card offers a lower APR. Not every credit card offers balance transfers, and many of the cards with this feature charge a balance transfer fee.Cash advance: Withdrawing cash from a credit card, most often through cash advance checks, using the card at an ATM, or by wiring money with the card. Cash advances usually have a higher APR and start accruing interest immediately, so it\\'s a poor way to use a credit card.Credit card: A credit card is a revolving line of credit issued by a bank and connected to a revolving line of credit. The cardholder can use their credit card for purchases and possibly other types of transactions, although this depends on the card.Credit limit: The credit card\\'s spending limit. This can vary based on the type of transaction. On credit cards that offer cash advances, there is typically a lower credit limit for cash advances than for purchases. A transaction that would exceed a card\\'s credit limit will be declined unless the cardholder has opted to allow over-the-limit transactions (and any potential fees that come with them).Credit score: A credit score is a rating of a consumer\\'s creditworthiness. The score indicates how likely it is that they will make bill payments on time and repay what they borrow. Credit scores are calculated based on the consumer\\'s financial history.Interest: A fee charged for borrowing money. The APR determines how much interest a credit card company can charge on balances. Use our interest rate calculator to get a sense of how much interest adds to your monthly bill.Minimum payment: The minimum amount a cardholder can pay by the due date to remain current on their credit card bill and avoid a late fee.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the best credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe best credit card for many people is the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card. It will get you a 2% cash rewards rate on purchases, making it one of the most lucrative and flexible credit cards. The $0 annual fee and lengthy 0% intro APR offer are also a big draw.While this is an easy pick to recommend for many people, it\\'s important to know that the market is packed with plenty of the best credit cards of 2023 (included on this shortlist and not). The best credit card to have will depend on your unique situation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow does a credit card work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA credit card allows you to pay for purchases by borrowing money. The maximum amount you can borrow at one time is called your credit limit. The money you\\'ve already borrowed is your balance, and the amount you have left to borrow is your available credit.At the end of each billing cycle, the card issuer will send you a statement listing the transactions you made. It will list your total balance, as well as the minimum payment due during that billing cycle. You must pay at least the minimum amount by the due date to avoid a late fee -- although it\\'s a good idea to pay more than the minimum if you can afford it.Credit cards are most often used for purchases, but many of them can also be used for other types of transactions, such as cash advances and balance transfers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow many credit cards should I have?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe right number of credit cards for most people is one. That\\'s particularly important for cardholders using credit cards for rewards, since the juice may not always be worth the squeeze when carrying multiple cards and using each to optimize rewards for each spending category.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow should I use a credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhether your credit card helps or hurts you all depends on how you use it. To ensure that your credit card provides value and doesn\\'t get you in debt, here are a few key guidelines:Use your credit card regularlyOnly charge what you can affordPay on time and in fullTake advantage of your card\\'s perks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow does credit card interest work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCredit card interest is the fee a card issuer can charge when you borrow money with your credit card. The amount of interest charged depends on the card\\'s annual percentage rate (APR). Many credit cards have different APRs for purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances. Most credit cards have a variable APR. A variable APR is an interest rate that can change over time.The type of transaction also determines when your card issuer starts charging you interest. For example, cash advances almost always start racking up interest immediately. Purchases are different. Just about any top-rated credit card will only charge interest for purchases that aren\\'t paid off by the payment due date. Savvy consumers take advantage of this, pay in full, and never have to deal with credit card interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to apply for a credit card online\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChoose a credit card and click \\\\\"Apply Now\\\\\": You\\'ll find this link on the credit card page.Fill out the required information: Card applications ask for your personal information, including your name, mailing address, date of birth, and Social Security number. They also ask for financial information, including your income.

The U.S. Bank Cash+\\\\u00ae Visa Signature\\\\u00ae Card can give you the flexibility you\\'re looking for.

Before you pick the best credit card with cash back, compare these three important features.Cash back rate: This is the most important feature. Higher cash back rates save you more money, especially if you have a high flat rate on purchases or choose bonus categories that match your spending habits.Annual fee: Cash back cards with annual fees tend to have higher cash back rates. These higher rates can make up for the annual fee if you spend enough, but you\\'ll need to do the math on the rewards you\\'ll earn to make sure.Bonus rewards: Many include an introductory bonus reward, making it an easy way to collect cash back. You could also look for credit cards that give cash back with 0% intro APR offers, free credit score monitoring, or many other perks.If you\\'re looking for a feature-by-feature comparison our credit card comparison tool can help.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare cash back credit cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Picks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCard\\\\nRating\\\\nGreat For\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5.00 stars\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

If you have good or excellent credit and can qualify for the best cash back cards, then they\\'re definitely worth checking out. But this type of credit card has its perks and its drawbacks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProsCash back on purchasesEasy to useMost cash back cards don\\'t charge an annual fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsUsually have smaller sign-up bonusesFewer travel perks and other extrasCan\\'t get any extra value on rewards redemptions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe great thing about cash back cards is how simple and affordable they are. Anyone can benefit from cash back, and there\\'s no learning curve involved like there can be with travel credit cards. You can find plenty of the best cash back credit cards with no annual fee. Even the ones with annual fees usually cost less than $100 per year.There is a tradeoff to those benefits. Cash back cards are affordable, but they also generally have smaller bonuses and fewer features than you could get from a higher-priced travel rewards card. And while cash back means rewards redemptions are a breeze, there\\'s no way to get more value out of cash back. With rewards credit cards that earn points, it\\'s sometimes possible to extract more value from those points if you know how to use them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to maximize your cash back rewardsUsing the best money back credit cards is a great way to save more every month. Here are the best tips to help you maximize cash back rewards:Always pay with your cash back credit card. Since you\\'re earning cash back on purchases, take full advantage. Put as much of your spending as you can on your cash back card. There\\'s no reason to pay with cash or a debit card and leave cash back on the table.Don\\'t carry a balance. The key to saving money with a cash back card is to pay your credit card bill in full by the due date. If not, the card issuer can charge you credit card interest. That will likely cost you as much or more as the cash back you earned.Get multiple cash back cards to earn more bonus rewards. Instead of using a single cash back card, open a few different cards that earn bonus cash back in separate categories. That way, you could have your gas and groceries card, your restaurant card, your Amazon card, and a card with a high flat rate for all those other expenses.Complete the welcome bonus requirements. Welcome bonuses are some of the biggest cash back offers you can find, so it\\'s important not to miss out. Whenever you get a new card with a welcome bonus, check how much you need to spend and how long you have.Check your credit card\\'s online shopping portal for special offers. Many credit card companies have online shopping portals where you can earn up to 10% back with some retailers. Make sure to check if your card issuer offers one and, if so, what type of bonuses are available.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCash back vs. points\\\\n\\\\nCash back and points are two types of credit card rewards. Cash back is only for cash. Meanwhile, points tend to offer more redemption options than cash back does, including points for travel, a gift card, cash, or merchandise. The exact options depend on the rewards credit card you have. The advantage of points is that there are more ways to use them, but this also makes them more complicated.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre cash back credit cards taxable?In most cases, cash back credit cards aren\\'t taxable. If you earn the cash back by using your card for purchases, then it\\'s not taxable, because the IRS considers it a rebate on those purchases and not income.That means any type of cash back credit card that requires spending money is treated as a rebate and isn\\'t taxable. For example, if your card earns 4% on dining or an unlimited 2% cash back on purchases, you wouldn\\'t need to pay taxes on that. This also includes welcome bonuses you need to spend money to earn, such as a bonus of $200 if you spend $500 in the first three months.While cash back usually isn\\'t taxable, it could be treated as income if it doesn\\'t require any spending on your part. Common examples include welcome bonuses that don\\'t have a spending requirement and referral bonuses.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDifferent types of cash back credit cardsThere are three basic types of cash back credit cards: Flat-rate cash back cards, bonus category cash back cards, and rotating bonus category cash back cards. By understanding how each type works, you\\'ll be able to figure out how to maximize some of the best cash rewards credit cards.Flat-rate cash back cardsFlat-rate cash back cards earn the same rate on purchases, typically 1.5% or 2%. This type of cash rewards credit card is ideal if your spending is fairly balanced and you don\\'t have any particular big spending categories among your everyday purchases.Consumers who do the math often find that they\\'ll earn the most with a flat-rate cash back card. If you\\'re interested in getting one, the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card is hard to beat. It can get you 2% cash rewards on purchases.Bonus category cash back cardsA bonus category cash back card offers a higher cash back rate in one or more categories, such as groceries, dining, or gas.Those who spend a lot in certain categories could collect more cash back with the right bonus category card. For example, the Blue Cash Preferred\\\\u00ae Card from American Express earns an industry-leading 6% back at U.S. supermarkets for up to $6,000 per calendar year. Terms apply. That\\'s an extremely valuable offer, even with the card\\'s annual fee (see rates and fees). There are bonus category cards to fit just about everyone, whether you need the best credit cards for gas, dining, or a different category.On eligible purchases outside of bonus categories, these cards have traditionally earned 1% back. But not all bonus category cards are like this anymore.Rotating bonus category cash back cardsA rotating bonus category cash back card offers a higher cash back rate in a changing mix of categories. You typically get new bonus categories every quarter with this type of card. In most cases, cardholders must activate their bonus categories before or during the quarter to earn the bonus rate.The advantages with these cash back credit cards are a very high cash back rate in bonus categories and the fact that you get new bonus categories regularly. But the latter can also be a downside, because you may occasionally get stuck with bonus categories that you won\\'t spend much money in.Two of the most popular rotating bonus category cards are the Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back and the Chase Freedom Flex\\\\u2120. Each offers 5% back on your first $1,500 spent in rotating bonus categories you activate every quarter. The Chase Freedom Flex\\\\u2120 is unique in that it also offers several fixed bonus categories.Highest cash back credit cardsBonus categories are a popular feature with cash back credit cards. To provide more info on them, we\\'re going to explain how some of the most common bonus categories work and the highest cash back credit card rates you\\'ll find in each one.Groceries: These cash back cards earn higher rates in merchants classified as grocery stores or supermarkets. This is a good time to clarify that bonus categories are based on the retailer, not the exact product you\\'re buying. If you go to the grocery store and buy shampoo, paper towels, or any non-food items, it still counts as a grocery store purchase.The best credit card for groceries offer cash back rates of up to 6% on supermarket purchases. Since this is one of the biggest spending categories for many consumers, a grocery cash back card can be a great choice.Gas: These cash back cards earn higher rates at gas stations. They usually only offer bonus cash back at traditional gas stations, not gas stations tied to supermarkets or warehouse clubs.Gas credit cards offer up to 4% on gas station purchases. Although they can be a good fit if you have a lengthy commute or a driving job, the typical consumer spends more in other areas, like groceries.Dining: These credit cards earn higher rates at any type of restaurant, including fast food, sit-down dining establishments, and everything in between. That also covers deliveries and carryout orders with restaurants. Food delivery apps, such as DoorDash and Grubhub, may or may not qualify, so you\\'ll need to check each card\\'s terms to see.Dining credit cards offer up to 4% on restaurant purchases. They work well if you\\'re the type who prefers going out to eat and placing delivery orders over cooking at home.Travel: These credit cards offer bonus cash back on either certain types of travel purchases or travel as a whole. If it\\'s certain types of purchases, the card issuer will specify what qualifies, such as hotels or air travel. If it\\'s travel as a whole, then anything the card issuer considers a travel category will qualify for bonus cash back.The best credit cards that earn bonus rewards on travel spending are travel credit cards, not cash back cards. Among those travel cards, rewards rates can be as high as 10% on certain types of travel purchases. Some of the best cash back credit cards offer bonus rates as high as 5% on certain types of travel purchases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlternatives to considerCash back cards are great, but they aren\\'t right for everyone. You may find that one of the following alternatives works better for you.Travel rewards credit cards: Frequent travelers usually benefit the most from travel rewards credit cards. If you go on trips multiple times per year, the travel perks and rewards that these cards offer can be big moneysavers. They also almost always have no foreign transaction fee, a benefit many cash back cards lack. And some travel cards have no annual fees.Balance transfer credit cards: You can stop paying interest on credit card debt with balance transfer credit cards. This type of card offers a 0% intro APR on balance transfers. There\\'s almost always a balance transfer fee, but that\\'s well worth it to pay down your debt at zero interest.Student credit cards: If you\\'re attending college, then a student credit card is a good way to get started on building your credit. While some of the best student credit cards offer cash back or other rewards, they\\'re aimed at adults who don\\'t have much credit history yet. You won\\'t need good or excellent credit to get them like you would with many popular cash back cards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan you get cash back with a credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn a way, yes. You\\'ll earn a percentage back on purchases that you make with your credit card. You can then redeem your cash back earnings. Some cardholders choose to receive their cash back as a statement credit on their credit card. Others prefer to have their cash back earnings deposited into their bank account.So, yes -- you can earn real money with a cash back card. You can choose the redemption option that works best for you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a good cash back rate for a credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA rate of 1.5% to 2% cash back is considered good for cash back offers with flat-rate rewards on purchases. Cash back rates vary though, so it\\'s good to shop around.Other cash back cards reward you with bonus cash back for making purchases in specific spending categories. Typically, bonus rates range from 3% to 5%. Keep in mind that some cards with a higher rewards rate may have a monthly or yearly spending cap in place, so you may not be able to earn unlimited bonus rewards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat credit score do you need for a cash back credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCredit score requirements vary from one card to another. The best credit card with cash back, attractive rewards rates, and new cardmember bonuses typically require applicants to have good to excellent credit -- a score of at least 670. However, approval is not guaranteed no matter your credit score. Other factors are considered when determining card approval -- such as income and credit history.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow does a cash back credit card work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen using your cash back credit card to pay for eligible purchases, you earn a percentage of cash back.The card issuer automatically calculates the cash back you\\'ve earned and adds it to your rewards balance. If you make a $100 purchase and your card earns 2% cash back, then the card issuer would give you $2. This usually happens at the end of every statement period, although there are some card issuers that deposit cash back daily.Cash back redemption options depend on the card. You may be able to redeem cash back as a statement credit on your credit card bill, as a deposit to your bank account, or as a check. Some cash back cards have redemption minimums, such as $25, but others have no minimum amount.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat credit card gives the most cash back?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card has the highest cash back credit card with a flat-rate at 2% for purchases.Counting bonus categories, the Blue Cash Preferred\\\\u00ae Card from American Express is the winner. It earns 6% back at U.S. supermarkets, up to a spending cap of $6,000 per calendar year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I maximize my cash back credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe keys to maximizing your cash back credit card are using it for every eligible purchase and always paying off the full balance. By using your card for every eligible purchase, you\\'ll collect the most possible cash back. When you pay off your full statement balance every billing period, you never incur interest charges on your purchases.

I know what to look for in a balance transfer card, including the fees and gotchas that might be hidden in the fine print or behind financial jargon. I also have a ton of experience crunching the numbers, so I can help readers understand the real-life impacts of a balance transfer on their finances.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nComparing balance transfer offersThe three main points you should look at when comparing balance transfer cards are:The intro APR offer: This tells you how long you\\'ll enjoy the 0% APR on your transferred balance. If you know you\\'ll need a long time to pay off your balance, look for the longest introductory term you can find.The go-to or standard APR: Once your introductory rate expires, your remaining balance will start accruing interest at the standard APR. This factor becomes important if you think you won\\'t be able to pay off your entire transferred balance before the intro offer ends.The balance transfer fee: Not only do you have to consider the transfer fee in terms of the fee itself -- lower fees are always better -- but the balance transfer fee will also reduce the total amount you can transfer.One thing you don\\'t need to consider are the rewards. You won\\'t earn rewards on transferred balances, and balance transfers won\\'t count toward any kind of welcome or sign-up bonus requirements.Check out the table below to quickly compare some of our favorite balance transfer cards:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCard\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIntroductory BT Offer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGo-To APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBT Fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCiti Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0%, 21 months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n19.24% - 29.99% (Variable)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3% ($5 min) for first 4 months, then 5% ($5 min.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Balance Transfer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0%, 18 months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms)*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Bank Visa\\\\u00ae Platinum Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0%, 18 billing cycles\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n18.74% - 29.74% (Variable)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEither 3% of the amount of each transfer or $5 minimum, whichever is greater\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare balance transfer credit cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Picks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCard\\\\nRating\\\\nGreat For\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 5.00 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5.00 stars\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

While the best balance transfer credit cards can save you hundreds in interest, they can also end up costing you.A balance transfer credit card is a good idea if:You want a lower interest rate. The biggest perk of 0% APR balance transfer credit cards is how much money they can save you. If you have credit card debt that you\\'ll be paying off over six months or longer, then a balance transfer could lead to big savings.You want to consolidate debt. When you have debt spread out across multiple credit cards, it can be difficult to manage. The best balance transfer cards allow you to consolidate debt so you only need to make one payment per month.You\\'re trying to boost your credit score. Credit card debt often results in a high credit utilization ratio, a factor that has a big impact on your credit score. Since opening a balance transfer card adds to your total credit, it will lower your credit utilization. That balance transfer could save you money and raise your credit score.A balance transfer credit card is not a good idea if:You don\\'t have a plan to pay off your debt. A balance transfer only helps if you take advantage of the opportunity by paying off as much debt as possible before the intro APR period ends, and you don\\'t overspend now that your debt isn\\'t costing you any interest. Otherwise, you could reach the end of the intro period with the same amount of debt or more. Use our balance transfer calculator to see how much you could save with a balance transfer.You have subpar credit. To qualify for the top balance transfer credit cards, you\\'ll typically need good credit. If your credit is bad or average, it\\'s a good idea to focus on building your credit. That way you don\\'t need to settle for a subpar balance transfer card.You could pay off existing credit card debt within a few months. When you\\'re this close to paying off your debt, it\\'s usually better to stick with your current credit card. A balance transfer fee could wipe out anything you\\'d save on interest. Even if it\\'s a balance transfer credit card with no fee, the credit card application will still take time and cause a small dip in your credit score.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to transfer a credit card balance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSavvy consumers use credit card balance transfer offers to refinance or consolidate credit card debt. And when used correctly, the best balance transfer credit cards can save you hundreds of dollars in interest. To get the best credit card balance transfer offers, it helps to understand how balance transfers work.Here are the three steps on how to do balance transfers:Search for one of the best balance transfer credit cards. Try to find a card with a long enough intro period so that you\\'ll be able to pay off your debt within that time frame.Open the card and transfer the balance. You\\'ll need the credit card number of the card with the balance as well as the amount to transfer. Most card issuers let you transfer balances online. So you\\'ll log in to the account for your balance transfer card and look for the balance transfer option. Alternatively, you can call the credit card company and do the balance transfer by phone.Make your payments. You\\'re still required to make payments on the original card until the balance transfer is processed. You\\'ll know that has happened once the original card balance changes. From this point on, you\\'ll make payments on the balance transfer card.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDoes a balance transfer affect your credit score?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBalance transfers can hurt and help your credit. When you use a balance transfer card, it affects three factors used to calculate your credit score:New credit (10% of your FICO\\\\u00ae Score): The credit card application will cause a hard credit inquiry, which negatively affects the new credit category. It\\'s not a serious issue, though, as most consumers only see their FICO\\\\u00ae Scores drop five points or less from a hard inquiry.Length of credit account history (15% of your FICO\\\\u00ae Score): A new credit card causes your average length of credit account history to decrease, and this can hurt your credit.Credit utilization (30% of your FICO\\\\u00ae Score): Your new balance transfer card\\'s credit limit will increase your total credit, causing your credit utilization to go down. That\\'s good for your credit score. But your credit utilization on each individual card is also important. If you end up with high credit utilization on the balance transfer card, then that could have a negative impact.Although your credit score may or may not drop after a balance transfer, it will likely go up as you pay down your credit card debt. After all, building a positive payment history is one of the best ways to rebuild credit. And balance transfer credit cards allow you to do that faster while also saving on interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs there a limit to how much you can transfer?\\\\n\\\\nYou can never transfer a balance that\\'s larger than your credit limit. Some of the best 0 balance transfer credit cards will only let you transfer up to a percentage of your credit limit -- usually 70% to 95% -- while others will let you reach your credit limit. Keep in mind that any balance transfer fees will add to your balance as well. If you\\'re transferring a $1,000 balance to a card with a 3% balance transfer fee, you\\'ll need a credit limit big enough to cover a $1,030 balance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a balance transfer credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA balance transfer credit card moves a balance from one account to another. Once you\\'ve completed a balance transfer, the original account is paid off, and you make payments on the account that received the transfer.You\\'re essentially using the balance transfer card to pay off your debt. The best balance transfer credit cards come with a 0% introductory APR -- similar to 0% intro APR credit cards -- on a qualifying balance transfer. This means that you won\\'t pay credit card interest on the balance transferred for the intro period, which can be anywhere from a few months to 20 or more billing cycles. After the introductory APR ends, the card issuer will start charging the card\\'s regular variable APR on any remaining balance. Paying off your balance quickly will help you avoid getting an interest charge when the intro APR period ends.The type of debt you can transfer depends on your balance transfer card.Sometimes a card issuer only allows a credit card transfer of balances, whereas others let you transfer all kinds of debt. Consumers typically use balance transfer cards for credit card debt.The total amount of the transfer, plus any balance transfer fees, must be less than the balance transfer card\\'s credit limit. If it isn\\'t, you\\'ll find your balance transfer denied. You can\\'t do a credit card transfer between two cards from the same card issuer, either. A balance transfer from a Chase credit card to a Citi credit card is fine, but a transfer between two Chase credit cards wouldn\\'t be allowed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBalance transfer feesA balance transfer fee is an extra fee charged by the receiving credit card -- the card you\\'re transferring to -- to process the balance transfer. Typical balance transfer fees range from 3% to 5% of the total amount transferred.The transfer fee is generally added to your overall credit card balance. For example, if you transfer $1,000 to a credit card with a 3% balance transfer fee, you\\'ll be charged an extra $30. Your new balance on the balance transfer card will be $1,030. In other words, you need to consider the transfer fee when determining how much you can transfer to a new card, since your total balance -- including the fee -- cannot exceed your credit limit.In addition to an introductory 0% APR, many of our favorite balance transfer cards also come with a promotional balance transfer fee. A fee drop from 5% to 3% can save you $20 per $1,000 transferred, so these promotional rates can be a big money saver.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat happens to the old credit card after the balance transfer?\\\\n\\\\nThe credit card that originally had the balance will remain open after the balance transfer. Although you can continue using it, you should strongly consider waiting until you\\'ve paid off all your credit card debt. That way, you don\\'t run the risk of running up a costly balance and ending up in the same position as before.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4 alternatives to balance transfer credit cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re not sure that a 0% APR balance transfer credit card is the best option for you, consider these alternatives:1. Personal loans for debt consolidationBy paying your debts with a personal loan, you\\'ll have a fixed loan term, payment amount, and interest rate. Consolidating debt is a great way to ensure you can afford your monthly payments and get your debt paid off in full. Even though debt consolidation loans don\\'t offer 0% intro APRs, you can find personal loans with low interest rates. You also won\\'t need to worry about the APR going up like it does with balance transfer cards at the end of the intro period.2. Home equity loans\\\\/home equity lines of creditSince a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) uses your home as collateral, they tend to offer some of the lowest interest rates you can find. Either is an affordable way to pay off debt, but you will need equity in your home to qualify. The fact that your home is the collateral also adds to your risk.3. Nonprofit credit counseling agenciesWhen you work with a credit counseling agency, it can give you advice on how to budget and pay back your debts. A credit counseling agency can also negotiate a debt management plan with your creditors. This option can be especially helpful if your credit isn\\'t the best, as it\\'s hard to find balance transfer credit cards for bad credit.4. Negotiating your credit card debtCredit card companies are often willing to negotiate your credit card debt with you if you\\'re having trouble making your monthly payments. Some might even have low interest credit cards you can consider. Many offer hardship plans that can reduce your card\\'s interest rate, fees, or minimum payment amount. Even if your card issuer doesn\\'t, you may still be able to negotiate any of those items.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat credit score do you need for a balance transfer credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou usually need a FICO\\\\u00ae Score of 670 or higher to qualify for a balance transfer credit card. Most balance transfer cards, especially the ones with a 0% intro APR, are intended for consumers who have good or excellent credit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much is a balance transfer fee?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA standard balance transfer fee is 3% or 5% of the transaction amount with a $5 minimum. To find out how much a specific credit card charges, check the fees section in its pricing and terms.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDoes a balance transfer card affect your ability to get a mortgage?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA balance transfer card alone most likely won\\'t affect your ability to get a mortgage, but credit card debt could.Lenders check your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio when you apply for a mortgage. If you have a high DTI ratio due to credit card debt, that could negatively impact your mortgage application. Large amounts of credit card debt can also affect your credit score, which is another item that mortgage lenders consider.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow does a balance transfer credit card work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA balance transfer credit card can accept balance transfers from other cards. When you set up a balance transfer, your balance transfer card is paying off your other credit card(s). The amount you transfer will be taken off the original credit card and put onto the balance transfer card.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow long does a balance transfer take?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA balance transfer can take anywhere from two days to six weeks. It depends on multiple factors, including the card issuers of both cards. Here are the typical balance transfer times for the most popular card issuers:American Express: Usually five to seven days, but can take up to six weeksBank of America: Up to 14 daysCapital One: Generally three to 14 daysChase: Seven to 21 daysCiti: Two to 21 daysDiscover: Most transfers are processed within four days, but new accounts have a 14-day waiting period before balance transfer requests can be processedU.S. Bank: Up to 14 daysWells Fargo: Up to 14 days\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAsk the experts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFrancisca Beer, Ph.D.\\\\n\\\\nProfessor of Finance, California State University, San Bernardino\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDr. Francisca Beer, Professor of Finance at California State University, San Bernardino, is renowned for her expertise in corporate finance, capital markets, and international finance.

Her commitment to financial literacy extends to WalletHub contributions, community workshops, and speaking engagements across the globe.\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWho would be a good candidate for a balance transfer credit card? Meticulous and knowledgeable consumers who are serious about paying down debt. Balance transfers can be problematic for customers for several reasons. Some customers overlook that a transfer means making monthly payments even if the APR is 0%. Others do not account for the transfer fee when evaluating the benefits of a transfer. Yet others do not understand the impact of a transfer on their credit limit when they use an existing card. Some do not understand when penalty rates will be applied. Do you need good credit for a balance transfer credit card? The transfer request will most probably be rejected when a customer has filed for a bankruptcy in the past. Transfers might also be declined for customers with past due payments or a low credit score. In some cases, the credit score is used to calculate the length of the 0% introduction period. What do consumers need to know about 0% intro APR offers? Generally speaking, if the balance transferred can be paid off within the 0% APR intro period, the transfer is probably a good idea. If the balance cannot be paid within that period of time, it\\'s important to know what the APR will be. It\\'s probably better to avoid using the card for anything else than paying the transfer balance. So customers should steer clear of using the card for both transfer and new purchases.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Brittney Myers\\\\nOur Credit Cards Expert\",\"Article Date\":\"September 29, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best Travel Credit Cards of October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/credit-cards\\\\/best-travel-rewards-credit-cards\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

The beauty of this card is in its generous rewards combined with its simplicity.Because the rewards are a flat two miles per dollar spent, there\\'s no need to juggle cards and remember which card to use when. Every purchase, no matter whether at a coffee shop, electronics retailer, or music streaming service \\\\u2013 two miles per dollar.Now this doesn\\'t mean that you can\\'t juggle cards. I did. The two miles per dollar is a great baseline rewards rate, so I would use this as my default card, but then pull out other specific cards only for focused categories, for instance keeping my Amazon spending on my Amazon card. But in my view, you can get away with a single card if you have this one.Rewards redemption is another way this card is extremely easy. There are a wide variety of ways you can use miles, including booking travel on the Capital One travel portal, transferring to one of Capital One\\'s partners, and using miles to cover travel purchases on your card statement. I did mostly the latter \\\\u2013 it\\'s not the highest opportunity redemption, but it was ridiculously easy.I will admit I didn\\'t make the most of the perks on this card, but there are quite a few. Traveling around Europe, the no foreign transaction fees were critical. And I always make use of card protections when available \\\\u2013 like the rental car coverages and extended warranty on this card. And though I\\'m more of a \\\\\"get in and out of the airport fast\\\\\" kind of person, the card does provide limited lounge access for the Capital One lounges and certain partner lounges.There\\'s a $95 annual fee (see rates and fees), which I never balked at because I got so much value out of the card. Right now, with a welcome offer of $750 miles, it\\'s even easier to justify that fee.Apply for the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card on Capital One\\'s website.Pros:Unlimited flat-rate rewards of 2X miles on every purchase$750-mile bonus offerEasy miles redemptionMany useful travel perks, including lounge accessCons:$95 annual feeHigher rewards rate possible with tiered systemsBest no annual fee travel credit card: Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit cardRewards rate: Unlimited 1.5 points per dollar spent on per $1 spent on all purchasesWhy we picked it: Many of the top travel cards come with an annual fee. This card proves that you don\\'t need to pay an annual fee to get solid travel rewards.What we think you need to know about the Bank of America Travel Rewards:I haven\\'t used this card in particular, but I do have and use its sister card \\\\u2013 the Bank of America\\\\u00ae Customized Cash Rewards credit card. The rewards program is different, but the core of these cards, as well as the Bank of America\\\\u00ae Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card, is very similar. Namely, they\\'re all really great rewards cards with no annual fee, and all get a significant bump in rewards if you\\'re a Bank of America Preferred Rewards member (as I am).The rewards here are simple: You get 1.5 points for every dollar spent, no matter the category. Points can be redeemed as a statement credit to pay for travel-related expenses like flights, hotels, rental cars, and restaurants. Each point credits $0.01, so every $1,000 spent on the card gets you 1,000 points, which gets you $10 in potential credits for travel spending.The 25,000 points you can earn via the card\\'s welcome offer (after spending $1,000 in the first 90 days days after account opening) work the same way. So that welcome offer is worth $250 towards travel.You generally can\\'t expect a huge number of extra perks on a card with no annual fee, and that\\'s the case here. However, there is an introductory 0% interest offer, currently at 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases and 0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days (after that, the go-to variable rate applies, which is currently 18.24% - 28.24% (Variable)).I don\\'t always enjoy trying to manage my financial accounts via app, but the Bank of America app is one that I do use regularly. I could quibble a bit about the design, but I think the usability is great. It\\'s easy to navigate between multiple types of Bank of America accounts. I can see card balances, due dates, rewards earned, and easily sign up for partner deals that often feature 10% to 15% savings.Also, Bank of America Preferred Rewards members get a 25% to 75% boost on the rewards that this card earns. That means that they\\'re getting between 1.87 and 2.62 points per dollar spent. That, combined with no annual fee (see rates and fees), makes this card or one of its sister cards basically a no-brainer for Preferred Rewards members.Apply for the Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card on Bank of America\\'s website.Pros:No annual feeUnlimited 1.5 points per dollar spent on every purchase25,000 points bonus offer0% intro APR offer for 15 billing cycles on purchases and balance transfers (after which the go-to rate of 18.24% - 28.24% (Variable) applies)25%-75% rewards boost for Preferred Rewards membersCons:Higher rewards rates available on cards with an annual feeLimited perksBest premium travel credit card: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit CardRewards rate: Earn 10X miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel and 5X miles on flights booked through Capital One Travel. 2X miles on all other purchases.Why we picked it: High rewards rates, hefty welcome bonus offer, travel credit, anniversary miles, and travel perks that you\\'ll actually use. For frequent travelers, the benefits of this card can easily justify the high annual fee.What we think you should know about the Capital One Venture X Card:The first question you should ask with a premium travel card is whether the big annual fee (see rates and fees) is justified. For frequent travelers, we think the answer is most likely yes for the $395 fee on the Capital One Venture X Card.It\\'d be hard to not get more than that value back in the first year, as the card has a welcome offer of 75,000 miles (after spending $4,000 in purchases in the first 3 months). We\\'d say that\\'s conservatively worth $750 in travel, and possibly more if you redeem well.Past the first year though, we still think the value of the card holds up well. For one, you get an annual $300 in statement credits for bookings through Capital One Travel. Plus, you get a 10,000 mile anniversary bonus, worth $100. So right there, you\\'ve got $400 in value to weigh against the $395 annual fee. We could argue that everything else is gravy.In any case, the rest of the features just further bump up the value of the card on an ongoing basis. That includes the high rewards rates you get booking through Capital One Travel \\\\u2013 10X miles for hotels and car rentals and 5X miles for flights. It also includes the solid 2X miles per dollar that you get on the rest of your purchases. And it includes premium travel perks like unlimited access to lounges for you and two guests (there aren\\'t many Capital One lounges, but you also have access to the 1,300+ lounges available in its partner network).There is a longer list of perks for many of the competing premium travel cards. This dings the Capital One Venture X Card a bit, but a lot of those perks get more targeted and won\\'t be a fit for everyone. Plus, many competing premium travel cards have an even higher annual fee.It\\'s also worth pointing out that additional cardholders can be added with no fee. That\\'s not always the case, especially with premium-level cards.And of course rewards points and miles are only as good as your ability to actually use them. In this case, there are multiple options, including the extremely easy option of using miles to cover travel expenses on your statement.Apply for the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card on Capital One\\'s website.Pros:High rewards rate, including strong baseline rate$750-mile welcome offerAnnual $300 travel credit and bonus 10,000 anniversary milesPremium travel perks, including worldwide lounge accessNo fee for additional cardholdersCons:High annual feeHighest rewards rates annual travel credit require using Capital One Travel portalNot as many perks as other premium travel cardsRunner-up: best premium travel card with flexible redemption options: Chase Sapphire Preferred\\\\u00ae CardRewards rate: 5X points on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards\\\\u00ae, 2X points on other travel, 3X points on dining, online grocery orders, and select streaming services, 1 point per $1 on other purchasesWhy we picked it: It earns bonus rewards across a variety of categories and has a welcome offer of 60,000 bonus points. Plus, this card\\'s Ultimate Rewards points give you lots of high-value redemption options.What we think you should know about the Chase Sapphire Preferred\\\\u00ae Card: Both Chase Sapphire cards are loaded with benefits, but there\\'s one in particular that makes them special -- their rewards program. Chase Ultimate Rewards is The Ascent\\'s pick for the best credit card rewards program.I have the Chase Sapphire Reserve\\\\u00ae, and I also had the Chase Sapphire Preferred\\\\u00ae Card, back when you could have one of each. I got both because they each have fantastic welcome offers and rewards rates, so they\\'re great for earning lots of points.With either card, you can transfer your points to many airline and hotel loyalty programs, and there are some incredible savings opportunities this way. For example, I\\'ve transferred Ultimate Rewards points to Hyatt and booked a stay at a four-star hotel in New York, paying in points for what would have been a $5,634 stay. I\\'ve also transferred points to book business-class airfare, once saving $4,142 in the process.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur first-hand review\\\\n\\\\nI initially got this card for the sky high welcome bonus, but have kept it due to several of its unique features and benefits \\\\u2014 which make it well worth the $95 annual fee. One of the highlights is Trip Delay Reimbursement. If your common carrier travel is delayed more than 12 hours or requires an overnight stay, you and your family are covered for unreimbursed expenses, such as meals and lodging, up to $500 per ticket.-Ethan Mellin, team member at The Motley Fool Ascent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApply for the Chase Sapphire Preferred\\\\u00ae Card on Chase\\'s website.Pros:2x to 5x points in bonus categories that include dining, travel, and online grocery ordersWelcome offer of 60,000 bonus pointsTransferable points with over a dozen travel partnersCons:Charges a $95 annual feeNon-bonus purchases earn standard rate of 1x point per $1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlso good for: best premium travel card for dining out: American Express\\\\u00ae Gold CardRewards rate: 4X points at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 per calendar year in purchases) and restaurants, plus takeout and delivery in the U.S., 3X points on flights booked directly with airlines or on amextravel.com, 1x point per $1 on other purchases, terms apply.Why we picked it: There aren\\'t many travel cards that earn high rewards rates on groceries and dining. This American Express card does, offering outstanding rewards on your U.S. supermarket and restaurant spending. Terms apply.What we think you should know about the American Express\\\\u00ae Gold Card: The American Express\\\\u00ae Gold Card seems expensive at first, with a $250 annual fee. (see rates and fees). But if you can take advantage of its benefits, it\\'s practically a steal.Case in point, it offers $10 per month in dining credits at participating restaurants and $10 per month in Uber Cash. That\\'s up to $240 in annual credits. Use those, and this card is only costing you $10. Select enrollment required, terms apply.American Express cards are usually a good fit for big spenders, and this one\\'s no exception. If you have high spending in its bonus categories, you\\'ll earn points quickly. And its bonus categories cover some of the biggest monthly expenses for many households.Many of this card\\'s benefits are designed with U.S. consumers in mind, including the spending credits and bonus rewards at U.S. supermarkets. That\\'s something to keep in mind if you travel often or live abroad.Apply for the American Express\\\\u00ae Gold Card on American Express\\'s website.Pros:4X points at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 per calendar year in purchases) and restaurants, plus takeout and delivery in the U.S.Transferable points with many airline and hotel partnersUp to $120 in annual dining creditsUp to $120 in annual Uber CashCons:Expensive with a $250 annual feeU.S.-centric benefits that may not be as useful for frequent travelersBest Airline Card: Delta SkyMiles\\\\u00ae Gold American Express CardRewards rate: 2X miles on U.S. supermarkets and at restaurants worldwide, including takeout and delivery in the U.S..Why we picked it: 40,000-mile welcome offer, free checked bags, and a variety of useful travel perks make this a top airline-specific credit card. (terms apply).My first-hand review:Choosing an airline credit card is fairly simple: choose the card of the airline you fly a lot. The rewards rates on airline cards are generally not that great, the ones that are even halfway worthwhile have annual fees, and the rewards are focused on that airline\\'s frequent flyer program.So if you don\\'t regularly fly the airline of the card, it\\'s going to be very hard to justify having that card. Past that, there are some airline cards that are just not that good, whether or not you fly that airline.Which brings us to the Amex Delta SkyMiles Gold. This card meets the sweet spot of being an airline that has broad enough route coverage that it\\'s a good option out of many airports, plus the credit card itself is good. Which is why I used to have this card in my own wallet.The welcome bonus offer is a big part of the value here. Currently 40,000, this could be worth significant travel value on Delta flights.For ongoing value though, the free checked bags, the $100 flight credit (after spending $10,000 in a calendar year), and the potential Delta-specific savings are what could easily justify the card staying in your wallet. (Terms apply; enrollment may be required.)Starting with the checked bag fee waiver, this alone can make the card very valuable for a family. We are a family of four, with young kids. It\\'s basically impossible to travel carry-on only like when my wife and I were child-free and globetrotting. The first checked bag on a Delta flight is $30 each way. If you take one flight per year and check two bags round trip, the $120 that you save already more than pays for the annual fee of this card in years 2+.Then we can add on the $100 flight credit. You have to spend $10,000 to earn this, but this isn\\'t points that you have to redeem -- it\\'s a much simpler Delta Flight Credit. And then the card also gives you access to TakeOff 15, which takes 15% off the price when you book Award Travel with Delta points on delta.com or the Delta app.But what about earning rewards? Well, that\\'s not as great. 2X miles per dollar on select categories \\\\u2013 in this case Delta purchases, restaurants, and U.S. supermarkets \\\\u2013 is not all that great, especially for a card that (after the first year) carries an annual fee. (Terms apply; see rates and fees.)That said, it\\'s nice that this card offers higher earning rates on spend other than with the airline, as many airline cards only give elevated rewards rates for spend with that airline.I mentioned above that I \\\\\"used\\\\\" to have this in my wallet. Why don\\'t I have it anymore? We got sick of driving to Atlanta (a Delta hub) for flights, so we don\\'t fly Delta much anymore. Which brings me back to my original point: If you\\'re going to get an airline card, the best one is the one of the airline you fly most (or at least fly a lot).And if you happen to fly Delta a lot? You\\'re in luck, because this is a very good card for Delta fliers.Apply for the Delta SkyMiles\\\\u00ae Gold American Express Card on American Express\\'s website.Pros:First checked bag fee waived for main cardholder and up to eight others (nine waivers total)40,000-mile bonus offer (after spending $2,000 in the first 6 months)15% savings on Delta Award Travel when booked through delta.com or Delta appHigher rewards rate on restaurants and U.S. supermarkets, in addition to Delta spendCons:Uninspiring 2X miles is the higher rewards rate$0 introductory annual fee for the first year, then $99.Best hotel credit card: Hilton Honors American Express CardRewards rate: 7X points on Hilton purchases, 5X on eligible purchases at U.S. restaurants, at U.S. supermarkets, and at U.S. gas stations, 3X for all other purchases.Why we picked it: This is a no annual fee card with decent rewards earning rates and a welcome offer of 80,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points. If you stay at Hilton properties, this card can be a great fit. (Terms apply; see rates and fees.)What we think you need to know about the Amex Hilton Honors Card:As with airline cards, choosing a hotel credit card really comes down to two factors: 1) Which hotels do you usually choose? and 2) Does that hotel group offer a decent card?If you don\\'t stay at a certain hotel group\\'s properties, that hotel-brand card isn\\'t going to make much sense for you. And even if you do stay at the brand\\'s properties, some hotel credit cards just aren\\'t that good.If you do happen to stay at Hilton properties though, this is a quality card that brings some nice perks.Before we talk about rewards, it\\'s important to note that Hilton Honors points don\\'t value out as highly as other points systems (this is true of most hotel points programs). It\\'s basically fair to think of points as worth about half of other non-hotel points, depending on what exactly you\\'re comparing it to.That means that the points-earning on this card isn\\'t as wildly high as it may seem at first glance. However, even after cutting the rates in half \\\\u2013 3.5x on Hilton spend, 2.5x on dining, 2.5x on U.S. supermarkets and gas stations, etc. \\\\u2013 it\\'s still very reasonable for a card that has no annual fee.Right now there\\'s also a welcome offer of 80,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points when you spend $1,000 in the first 3 months.The card also gives holders Hilton Honors Silver Status, which unlocks Hilton property bonuses like a 20% boost on points-earning on stays, free bottled water, and a fifth night free on reward stays.There aren\\'t all that many beyond this, but for those that stay more often at Hilton properties and are willing to pay an annual fee, the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass\\\\u00ae Card and the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire Card offer higher earn rates, bigger welcome bonuses, a higher status boost, and more perks.Apply for the Hilton Honors American Express Card on American Express\\'s website.Pros:No annual feeWelcome offer of 80,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points (after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months)Hilton Honors Silver Status boost7X points on purchases at hotels and resorts in the Hilton portfolioCons:Limited perksLower comparative rewards value after adjusting against other (mainly non-hotel) points systems\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMore of our top travel credit card picksThough these cards didn\\\\u2019t make our top picks list above, they are still high-quality travel cards in our view.

Make sure the card you choose works for your budget or stick to the best travel credit card with no annual fee if you\\'d prefer.Sign-up bonus: Many travel cards offer some of the biggest sign-up bonuses on the market. Compare both the bonuses that your chosen cards offer and the amount you\\'d need to spend on eligible purchases to receive each bonus.Rewards rate: The best credit cards for travel rewards often have bonus categories where they earn more rewards, such as 3 points per $1 on dining. Others earn the same rate on purchases, such as 2 points per $1 on all eligible purchases no matter the category. See which travel credit cards have rewards rates fit for your spending habits.Additional benefits: There are all kinds of features available with credit card travel rewards, from complimentary elite status with airlines and hotels to travel insurance policies. Review each card\\'s extras to figure out how much value it would offer you.Choose some of the top travel credit cards that stand out to you. If you\\'re looking for the best travel credit cards for beginners, the simplest way to evaluate them is to use The Ascent\\'s tool to compare credit card offers for a feature-by-feature review.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs a credit card with travel rewards right for me?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe more that you travel, the better a travel points credit card will work for you. If you go on two or three trips per year, you should be able to make the most of the benefits that the best travel card offers. If you\\'re traveling even more frequently than that, then the best travel rewards card will likely be extremely valuable to you. If you don\\'t travel that much, other rewards credit cards would be a better option.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoints vs. miles: what\\'s the difference?\\\\n\\\\nPoints and miles are two ways of referring to travel rewards. The term that\\'s used depends on the credit card issuer, and neither has a set definition. In general, credit card points is the more common term. Credit card miles is a term used primarily by airlines. However, neither is set in stone. There are other types of travel cards that refer to their rewards as miles, and there are credit cards with airline miles that refer to their rewards as points.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much are travel rewards worth?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere are a lot of different loyalty programs, and they all have their own travel rewards. The tricky part is figuring out how these travel rewards compare to each other. For example, are miles with Delta and Southwest worth the same amount, or is one more valuable?Although airline and hotel rewards don\\'t have a fixed value, we\\'ve calculated approximate values based on what they\\'re usually worth. You may get more or less depending on how you redeem them, but these are the usual values with the major airline and hotel loyalty programs.Airline rewards values\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAirline\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nValue per mile\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska Airlines\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.016\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Airlines\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.014\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelta Air Lines\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.014\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFrontier Airlines\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.010\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJetBlue Airways\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.014\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouthwest Airlines\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.014\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSpirit Airlines\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.011\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUnited Airlines\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.013\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBased on The Ascent\\'s valuation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHotel rewards values\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHotel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nValue per point\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest Western\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.007\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChoice Hotels\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.006\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHilton\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.005\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHyatt\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.016\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIHG\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.006\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarriott\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.007\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRadisson\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.004\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyndham\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$0.009\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBased on The Ascent\\'s valuation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLove Rewards?

Below are the types of benefits available with travel cards. Once you know which benefits you want, you can look for cards that have those features.Purchase rewards: The best travel credit cards earn rewards on purchases, and you can redeem them for free travel. Many of the most popular travel cards also have bonus categories in which you earn more rewards than the standard rate. If you find a card with bonus categories that match your spending habits, you can maximize your rewards.Sign-up bonus: Most travel cards include a sign-up bonus offer, which is a big chunk of rewards you can earn as a new cardholder. To get the bonus, you need to complete the terms. This usually requires spending a certain amount on the card within a timeframe, such as $3,000 in the first three months.Airport lounge access: Airline credit cards and premium travel credit cards often include complimentary access to airport lounge programs. If you spend a lot of time at the airport, this perk can make waiting for your flight more comfortable.Free checked luggage: Many airline credit cards allow you to check one or more bags for free. Depending on the card, companions traveling on the same itinerary may get to share in this benefit.Free night certificate: A common feature of hotel credit cards is a yearly free night certificate. Terms apply on when and where you can use these certificates, and they usually don\\'t work at the most expensive properties. However, they can still save you $100 or more.Travel protections: Many of the best travel credit cards often include complimentary protections on eligible purchases such as:Car rental loss and damage insuranceTrip cancellation and interruption insuranceTrip delay insuranceLost luggage reimbursementSpending credits: Premium travel credit cards with high annual fees typically have spending credits to balance out their fees. These credits automatically apply on eligible purchases. Here are a few examples:A membership fee credit for TSA PreCheck, Global Entry, or CLEARAn annual credit covering travel purchasesA monthly credit for Uber, DoorDash, or other popular appsElite loyalty program status: Gaining elite status in airline and hotel loyalty programs normally requires that you make quite a few bookings. Some of the top travel credit cards let you cut the line by offering cardholders complimentary elite status with one or more loyalty programs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTypes of travel rewards credit cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere are four types of travel rewards credit cards. You\\'ll find a description of each type below.Airline credit cardsAn airline credit card is tied to an airline loyalty program, also known as a frequent flyer program. When you use the best credit card for frequent flyers, it earns miles in that program. You can redeem your miles for award airfare. Instead of paying $250 for a ticket, you may be able to buy it for 25,000 miles. The best credit card for airline miles often include additional perks with the airline, such as free checked luggage or airport lounge access.Hotel credit cardsA hotel credit card is tied to a hotel loyalty program. When you use a hotel credit card, it earns rewards points in that program. You can redeem your points for award hotel stays, such as paying 30,000 points per night instead of $150 per night. Hotel credit cards also frequently offer extra perks with the hotel chain. These could include a complimentary late checkout, elite status in the hotel\\'s loyalty program, or a free night award every year.Travel credit cards with fixed-rate rewardsA travel credit card with fixed-rate rewards lets you redeem your rewards for cash travel purchases. Rewards are always worth the same amount toward travel this way. For example, if your card offers $0.01 per point, then 10,000 points will always be worth $100 in travel. Depending on the card, you can either use your rewards as a statement credit toward previous travel purchases, use them in the card issuer\\'s travel portal to book travel, or both.Travel credit cards with transferable rewardsA travel credit card with transferable rewards lets you send your rewards to other loyalty programs. For example, if your travel card has rewards you can transfer to Hyatt Hotels, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines, then you could send your points to any of those programs. You would then be able to book travel through that loyalty program using your points.They\\'re great if you don\\'t have any specific airlines or hotels you like more than the rest. Specifically, look for travel cards in a major credit card rewards program:Chase Ultimate RewardsAmerican Express Membership RewardsCapital One Venture RewardsCiti ThankYou RewardsSince these card issuers have large rosters of airline and hotel partners, they offer the best international travel credit cards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlternatives to travel credit cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNot sure if a credit card with travel points is what you need? Here are the most popular alternatives.Cash back credit cardsA cash back credit card earns rewards on purchases. The difference is that instead of rewards you can use for travel, it earns cash rewards. You can typically redeem your cash back as a statement credit on your credit card bill, a deposit to your bank account, or a check. Cash back cards are great for consumers who want to earn credit card rewards but aren\\'t big travelers. The reward can also be much easier to use, and many cash back credit cards don\\'t have annual fees.Credit cards for bad creditA credit card for bad credit is one that you can get even if you have a low credit score or no credit history. In that situation, it\\'s unlikely you\\'ll qualify for a travel card.

The Wells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card is built for this job, offering a long intro period that eclipses our other top picks.The main thing to consider here is how long you need to pay off your purchase. If you need as long as you can get, then you may have to sacrifice rewards for a longer introductory period. However, if you can pay off your purchase in 15 months or less, there are a lot of rewards cards worth considering.Sometimes, you know going into it that you\\'ll need as long as possible to pay off a particularly large purchase (such as a car repair or medical bill). These cards are all built for long-term financing, offering at least 18 months of 0% APR on new purchases.Compare the best no interest credit cards on purchases\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCard\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% Intro APR Offer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRegular APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% intro APR, 21 months from account opening\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\/A\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Bank Visa\\\\u00ae Platinum Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0%, 18 billing cycles on purchases\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n18.74% - 29.74% (Variable)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nN\\\\/A\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see, while these cards all have fantastic intro APR offers -- that\\'s about all you get. These cards don\\'t come with purchase rewards or other perks that will make you want to keep them for the long haul.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 0% APR cards for balance transfersOur top pick here is the Citi Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card (see rates and fees) thanks to its long zero interest 21 months introductory period and a low introductory balance transfer fee. If you want to compare your other options, those are the two main features to consider.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBalance transfers are used to move debt from one credit card to another card. When you transfer a balance to a card with a 0% intro APR offer for balance transfers, that balance won\\'t accrue interest until the end of the intro period. Once that ends, the balance will start accruing interest at the go-to APR.Learn more: Balance transfer guideMany folks will have been dealing with their debt for a while before they transfer it, so it\\'s likely you\\'ll be looking to get as much time as possible to pay it off. The cards below have the longest no-interest introductory periods of our top picks.Although these offers mean you won\\'t accrue interest for up to 21 months, you don\\'t have the whole intro period to transfer your balance. Instead, each card has its own time limit on when you need to transfer your balance for it to be eligible for the 0% intro rate. Any balance transferred after this time limit won\\'t qualify for the zero interest offer.Balance transfer fees for 0% intro APR cardsBalance transfers can be excellent ways to reduce your interest fees, but they\\'re generally not free. Nearly all credit cards charge a balance transfer fee. That said, some of our top picks have lower fees than their competitors. Others offer lower fees as part of the welcome offer for new cardholders.The balance transfer fee is charged by the card you move the balance to, not the one you move the balance from, so you only need to pay it once per transfer.Keep in mind that the balance transfer fee counts against your balance transfer limit. In other words, it reduces the total amount you can transfer to that card, so be sure to include it in your calculations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare the best 0% APR balance transfer credit cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCard\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBalance Transfer Intro APR Offer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRegular APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBalance Transfer Fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWells Fargo Reflect\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% intro APR, 21 months from account opening on qualifying balance transfers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n18.24%, 24.74%, 29.99% variable APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n5%; min: $5\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCiti Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIntro APR of 0%, 21 months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n19.24% - 29.99% (Variable)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3% ($5 min) for first 4 months, then 5% ($5 min.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Balance Transfer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIntro APR of 0%, 18 months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms)*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 0% APR credit cards with rewardsA good pick for most folks will be the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card, which pairs a high flat rewards rate with a competitive introductory term. Many rewards credit cards also offer intro APR deals, so you can earn rewards and still save money on interest fees. Remember that you only earn rewards on new purchases. You won\\'t earn cash back rewards on any transferred balances.Compare our other top cards with both rewards and intro APR offers below.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSome zero-interest cards are one-trick ponies that are only really good for saving on interest fees. However, many cards offer not only solid 0% intro APR offers, but also come with great purchase rewards, too. Even better, you can earn rewards on your new purchases while still enjoying the 0% interest rate during your introductory period.See more: Best rewards credit cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare the best 0% APR cards with rewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCard\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIntro APR Purchase Offer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRegular APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% intro APR, 15 months from account opening\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n20.24%, 25.24%, or 29.99% variable APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2% cash rewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChase Freedom Flex\\\\u2120\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% Intro APR on Purchases, 15 months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n20.49%-29.24% Variable\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1% - 5% cash back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCiti Custom Cash\\\\u00ae Card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIntro APR of 0%, 15 months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n19.24% - 29.24% (Variable)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1% - 5% cash back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover it\\\\u00ae Balance Transfer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIntro APR of 0%, 6 months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1% - 5% Cashback\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre 0% APR credit cards worth it?Ideally, we\\'d all pay our credit card balances in full each month. But sometimes you just need a little more time. You can get that time -- without the high interest fees with a top 0% APR credit card. But make note, once the intro period ends, you\\'ll start accruing interest at the go-to rate.Credit cards with a 0% intro APR are useful if you want to avoid interest charges, either on purchases or balance transfers. Make sure to consider how long of a 0% APR period you need. Cards with the longest 0% introductory periods often offer just that -- long 0% APR periods -- but nothing else.If your specific needs are met with a somewhat shorter introductory APR period, you may be able to find a card that meets that need and provides rewards or cash back, for instance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ntip_light_bulb\\\\nexported from figma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen to get a 0% APR credit card\\\\n\\\\nIf you have any costly purchases coming up that you can\\'t pay for in full, a credit card with 0% intro APR could be the solution. You can stretch your payments out over the card\\'s introductory period, and you\\'ll avoid paying interest as long as you pay off your balance before it ends. But you do need to understand how zero interest credit cards work first, to avoid making any costly mistakes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do credit cards with 0% APR work?On intro 0% APR credit cards, the intro APR on purchases is set to 0% for a limited period of time. That means you don\\'t need to pay off your full credit card balance every month to avoid interest during the intro period, as you would with other credit cards.As an example, imagine you get the best 0% APR credit card with an intro 0% APR on purchases for 15 months. You use it to buy a new computer for $1,500. All you need to do is make the minimum payment every month. If you make payments of at least $100 per month toward that purchase, then you\\'ll pay it off interest free.There are situations where you can be charged interest by your credit card company, even with a 0% credit card APR:You don\\'t make your minimum monthly payment. You\\'re still required to make minimum payments on time. If you don\\'t, the card issuer could cancel the intro 0% APR offer.You use your credit card for other types of transactions. Most cards\\' 0% intro APR offers don\\'t apply to cash advances.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nOpt for 0% APR credit cards with a lengthy intro period\\\\n\\\\nLessen your monthly payments with a lengthy intro period, like a 21 month no interest credit card. Make sure it doesn\\'t charge an annual fee as that will eat into what you\\'re saving on interest. Make it even better with the best credit card offers that have cash rewards or a welcome bonus.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlternatives to no interest credit cardsDepending on your financial needs, interest free credit cards with 0% intro APR may not be the right choice. Here are the top alternatives to credit cards with a 0% intro APR.Balance transfer credit cardsIf you have credit card debt to refinance, then a zero interest credit card balance transfer is the way to go. A balance transfer is when you move existing credit card balances onto a new card. The top 0 balance transfer credit cards have 0% intro APR periods on any balances you transfer over. In most cases, you\\'ll have to pay a balance transfer fee. Head to our balance transfer calculator to find out whether the interest you\\'d save with a balance transfer credit card is worth its balance transfer fee.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent\\'s best balance transfer credit cardsCredit cards with low interestIf you expect it to take you more than a couple years to pay off your balance, and if you have excellent credit, you might be better off with a low interest credit card. These credit cards have a low ongoing APR on all purchases, so they\\'re good to keep on hand in case you ever need to carry a balance. Sometimes these cards will also let you earn cash rewards. Some credit unions even offer low interest credit cards with rates lower than many personal loans.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent\\'s best low interest credit cardsPersonal loansWith a personal loan, you\\'ll have a fixed payment amount and loan term, which gives you more structure than a credit card. Personal loans are also better for when you will take two years or longer to pay off a purchase because they have lower interest rates than credit cards. But if you are confident you can pay off a purchase within the intro period of an intro 0% credit card, then the card would save you money. The better your credit score, the better your chances are of securing a personal loan with a low interest rate.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent\\'s best personal loansDebt consolidation loansYou can get a debt consolidation loan for any type of debt. It can be more versatile than a balance transfer card, because some balance transfer cards (but not all) can only be used for credit card debt. Debt consolidation loans are also a good choice when you need more time to pay off your debt than the intro period a balance transfer card gives you.Compare our picks: Check out The Ascent\\'s best debt consolidation loans\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do credit card interest rates work?Credit card interest is the fee you pay when you borrow money using your credit card. Every billing cycle, the card issuer will apply the credit card APR to any transactions eligible for interest charges.APR stands for annual percentage rate, and on credit cards, it serves as the interest rate. Most credit cards have a variable APR. With a variable APR, your interest rate can change over time. Most credit cards have a predetermined APR range, and your actual APR is determined in part by your credit score.Many credit cards also charge a different variable APR for each type of transaction (purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances). If you get behind on your payments, some credit cards may start charging a higher penalty APR.Not all transactions incur interest. Credit cards, including interest free credit cards, typically have a grace period between the date your statement is sent to you and its due date. If you pay off the full statement balance, you won\\'t be charged interest on your purchases. And of course, you also won\\'t be charged the interest rate if your card has a 0% intro APR offer in effect.Learn more: How to Lower Your Credit Card Interest Rate\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow More [ + ]\\\\nShow Less [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a 0% APR credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA 0% APR credit card doesn\\'t charge interest on purchases for an introductory period. If you carry a balance from purchases during that time, you won\\'t incur any interest charges. You are required to make minimum payments because if you don\\'t, the card issuer may cancel the zero-interest offer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat happens after the 0% APR ends?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnce the 0% APR offer ends, the credit card APR standard will apply to the current balance and new charges. This means you\\'ll start paying the regular interest rate on any remaining balance you couldn\\'t pay off before the end of the intro period. That\\'s why it\\'s highly recommended you pay off your entire balance before the end of the intro 0% APR offer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow long is the intro period for 0% APR credit cards?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe length of the intro period varies by card. Some credit cards offer a 0% intro APR for six months or less, but there are also intro 0% APR credit cards offering 18 months or longer without interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I avoid paying credit card interest?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou can avoid paying credit card interest on the best 0% APR credit cards by paying off your entire balance before the introductory period ends. This can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars compared to what standard credit card interest rates would cost you.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Lyle Daly\\\\n and\\\\u00a0Brittney Myers\\\\nOur Credit Cards Experts\",\"Article Date\":\"September 27, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best Rewards Credit Cards for October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/credit-cards\\\\/best-rewards-credit-cards\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

I\\'ve got the spreadsheets as evidence! Above all, I have a passion for helping others find great credit cards that will improve their financial lives.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest rewards card overallWells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae CardRewards rate: Unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchasesWhy we picked it: It has the highest flat-rate, unlimited cash rewards that we\\'ve seen, plus a $200 welcome offer to add to its value.What we think you should know about the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card: If you strive for simplicity with your finances, this Wells Fargo card does the trick. You don\\'t need to worry about activating bonus categories, or what purchases qualify for those categories. You earn 2% cash rewards for any type of purchase you put on this card.It\\'s one of a few 2% back cards, but I think it\\'s the best of the bunch. Other options dish out your cash back as 1% when you make a purchase and 1% when you pay it off, or restrict how you can use your rewards. This Wells Fargo card doesn\\'t do either of those, so it\\'s the easiest to use.Unlike those competitors, this card also has a welcome offer. You can earn $200 cash rewards bonus after spending $500 in purchases in the first three months. Once again, it\\'s a straightforward, high value benefit.Apply for the Wells Fargo Active Cash\\\\u00ae Card on Wells Fargo\\'s website.Pros:Earn 2% cash rewards in all spending categories$200 cash rewards welcome offer0% intro APR, 15 months from account opening on purchases and balance transfersCons:Charges a 3% foreign transaction feeWells Fargo has a below average customer satisfaction rating (based on J.D. Power survey)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest rewards credit card for travelBank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit cardRewards rate: Unlimited 1.5x points per $1 on purchasesWhy we picked it: It\\'s one of few travel credit cards with no annual fee, and you can boost its rewards rate if you\\'re in the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program.What we think you should know about the Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card: This is a solid rewards card that gets significantly better for Bank of America Preferred Rewards clients. If you have enough in qualifying assets with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch to qualify, you can join that program and get access to many benefits, including a higher rewards rate with Bank of America cards.The base rate for this card is 1.5 points per dollar, which is reasonable, although not spectacular. Bank of America Preferred Rewards clients get a rewards boost of 25% to 75%. That takes the rewards rate up to between 1.875 points and 2.625 points per $1.If you\\'re a Preferred Rewards client, a Bank of America card is probably the right choice. It could be this one, or another one of the bank\\'s rewards cards. If not, it\\'s still a good card, but not necessarily a slam dunk.Apply for Bank of America\\\\u00ae Travel Rewards credit card on Bank of America\\'s website.Pros:Rewards boost of 25% to 75% for Preferred Rewards clients25,000 points welcome offer (worth $250 toward travel)0% Intro APR for 15 billing cycles for purchases and balance transfersCons:Doesn\\'t offer many travel benefits, which limits the value for frequent travelersRewards rate is average without rewards boost\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest cashback credit card for bonus categoriesDiscover it\\\\u00ae Cash BackRewards rate: 5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categories when you activate (up to $1,500 spending cap), 1% cash back on other purchases.Why we picked it: This Discover card is a great blend of high value and a user-friendly experience. It has a robust rewards program, earning 1% - 5% Cashback, plus Discover\\'s innovative Cashback Match.What we think you should know about the Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back: You really can\\'t go wrong with a Discover card. They all keep fees to a minimum, with no annual fee or foreign transaction fee, and Discover even automatically waives your first late fee.The Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back is my pick for the card issuer\\'s best points card. It\\'s one of few no annual fee cards to earn 5% back, in everyday spending categories that change every quarter. To make it even better, Discover automatically matches all the cash back you\\'ve earned at the end of your first year.I got this card last year, and what I love is that it can benefit just about anyone. With its rewards rate, it works well in a one-card wallet where you always pay with the same credit card. But if you have other rewards cards, like I do, it slots in seamlessly. Just find out where it\\'s earning 5% each quarter, activate, and use it in those bonus categories.Apply for Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back on the Discover website.Pros:5% cash back in rotating quarterly bonus categoriesUnlimited Cashback Match welcome offer0%, 15 months intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months, after which a go-to 17.24% - 28.24% Variable APR applies.No annual fee or foreign transaction feeCons:Standard cash back rate of 1% on non-bonus purchasesNot as widely accepted internationally as Visa or Mastercard\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlso good cashback credit card: Citi Custom Cash\\\\u00ae CardRewards rate: 5% cash back in top eligible spending category (up to $500 spending cap), 1% on other purchasesWhy we picked it: With most rewards cards, the card issuer picks the bonus categories. With this Citi card, you earn big bonus cash back in whichever eligible category you spend the most.What we think you should know about the Citi Custom Cash\\\\u00ae Card: There aren\\'t too many cash back cards that earn 5% back in any spending category. This Citi card does, for no annual fee, and that cash back rate is customized to fit your spending habits (hence the card name).Here\\'s how it works -- every billing cycle, you earn 5% in your top eligible spending category, up to a maximum of $500 in purchases. There\\'s a list of 10 eligible categories, including grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, home improvement stores, and live entertainment.If you go out to a few concerts one month, you can earn 5% back on your tickets. Have some projects around the house over the summer? You can earn 5% back on supplies at home improvement stores. It\\'s a card that makes it easy to maximize your rewards.Apply for Citi Custom Cash\\\\u00ae Card on the Citi website.Pros:5% cash back based on where you spend the mostWelcome offer of 20,000 ThankYou\\\\u00ae Points (worth $200)0%, 15 months intro APR on purchases and balance transfersCons:Only one bonus category per billing cycle -- other purchases earn standard 1% cash back rateCharges a foreign transaction fee of 3%\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest flat rate cash back credit cardCapital One Venture Rewards Credit CardRewards rate: Earn unlimited 2X miles on every purchase, every day. Earn 5X miles on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel.Why we picked it: You can earn big with this card, courtesy of the 2x miles per $1 and a welcome offer of 75,000 miles. Capital One Venture miles are also easy to use.What we think you should know about the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card: I used to have this card, and now use the premium version, the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. Both are top-flight travel cards with a lot of benefits in common, and a couple of standout perks.For starters, you can earn miles very quickly with this card. It has a $750-mile welcome offer and earns 2 miles per $1 on purchases. Most travel cards have bonus categories, but earn 1% on non-bonus spending. Personally, I love having a travel card that I can rely on to get 2 miles per $1 everywhere.Another nice thing about Capital One Venture cards is the reward redemption options. Venture miles are redeemable for any type of travel purchase at $0.01 per mile. Or, you can transfer miles to Capital One\\'s partners and potentially get much more value. I regularly save thousands on business-class airfare by transferring my Venture miles.Apply for Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card on Capital One\\'s website.Pros:Earn an unlimited 2x miles per $1 on purchases$750-mile welcome offerMiles are redeemable for any type of travel purchase or transferable to Capital One\\'s travel partnersTwo complimentary airport lounge visits per yearCons:Very limited bonus categoriesCapital One doesn\\'t have as many travel partners as some other card issuers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMore of our best credit cards for points:Though these cards didn\\\\u2019t make our list above, they are still excellent rewards cards in our view.

But if you\\'re going to trust our ratings, it\\'s helpful to understand how we rate rewards cards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s a quick look at what our ratings mean.5 Stars: This is a top notch card that offers a combination of rewards rates, sign-up bonus, and perks that deliver lots of value for cardholders. If these cards have an annual fee, the value offered is typically much greater than the fee.4 Stars: These are solid credit cards. They don\\\\u2019t offer quite as much value as five-star cards and annual fees may eat into more of the value than we\\\\u2019d like. But these are still generally good cards to hold and specific features may make them great choices for certain users.3 Stars: This is typically the lowest rating you might see for a card on our site. This means that a card doesn\\\\u2019t offer much value to users compared to other rewards cards. There\\\\u2019s likely not a sign-up bonus and perks are probably very mediocre. There still could be a specific feature or element of the card that might make them worthwhile to certain users.We basically never have one- or two-star credit card ratings. It\\\\u2019s not because we\\\\u2019re trying to be kind to the credit card companies. It\\\\u2019s because when a bank launches a credit card, it knows what\\\\u2019s on the market and what a card will need to be competitive. So it\\\\u2019s extremely rare to see a credit card launched that is just plain terrible.In other words, the worst credit cards we typically see are those we\\\\u2019d call \\\\u201cmediocre\\\\u201d rather than \\\\u201cbad\\\\u2019.Creating rewards card ratingsWhen actually creating our star ratings for rewards cards, our aim is to focus on elements that will really matter to typical users. This means that our ratings will reflect how well these cards work out for many people, but not all. This makes those star ratings a good element to include in your research, but you still need to consider whether a particular card offer is a good fit for you.Here\\\\u2019s a look at the specific elements we weigh when calculating our ratings.Rewards earning potentialThis is the most critical element of a rewards card, so we put a lot of focus here. To compare rewards cards that have varying rewards systems, we first consider whether the card provides flat-rate rewards or has a tiered system.For flat-rate rewards programs, we give our highest marks to cards with 2% cash back or the equivalent in points value. In tiered-rewards programs -- in which you earn different rates for varying spending categories -- our highest marks go to cards with 5 points or more on a key category like groceries, travel, or gas.Sign-up bonusSome rewards cards offer a welcome bonus to new cardholders. These chunks of cash back or points can amount to quite a bit and can drastically raise the value you can get from the credit card.Many cards with no annual fee offer sign-up bonuses with values in the $100 to $200 range. This is fairly average. Our top scores go to cards with sign-up bonuses that top $1,000. But be aware, you\\'ll almost surely need to pay an annual fee for a bonus in that range.Annual feeMany consumers assume that no annual fee is always better. There are definitely big advantages to not paying an annual fee. However, cards with annual fees sometimes have rewards rates, sign-up bonuses or perks that make the fee well worth it.In our ratings, we give top marks to cards with no annual fee. And although premium credit cards with annual fees exceeding $500 can be a great choice for some cardholders, these cards get our lowest marks here.PerksPlacing a numerical rating on a credit card\\'s perks is challenging. For one, the value of these features can be hard to calculate. And unlike cash back and points, the value of the perks can vary a lot from one cardholder to the next.So instead of trying to calculate specific values here, we put cards and their perks into buckets. Rewards cards with a wide variety of perks that are valuable to a broad number of cardholders get our top marks. Card offers with a nice selection of perks, but that are more focused -- imagine a travel credit card with free checked baggage and lounge access -- get somewhat lower scores. And those cards with a minimum number of perks score at the bottom.A few things we don\\\\u2019t add directly to our calculationsHere are a few things that don\\\\u2019t go directly in to our ratings calculation:Regular APR: We strongly believe that borrowing on credit cards at the standard APR is not a good idea. This doesn\\\\u2019t apply at all times and for all people. But credit cards tend to have high standard APRs that don\\\\u2019t make them good for borrowing. Therefore we don\\\\u2019t include regular APR as a factor in our rating.Introductory APR offers: Some rewards cards also have introductory APR offers, such as a period of 0% interest on new purchases or a period of 0% on balance transfers. This can be a great benefit. However, if you\\\\u2019re in need of a 0% period on purchases or a balance transfer, we suggest focusing on getting a 0% card that matches your needs, paying down your credit card debt, and then focusing on credit card rewards. That said, we do factor this into how we rate a card\\'s overall perks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaximizing your cash back card rewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGetting the most out of a cash back card with a tiered rewards program or bonus categories system is a bit more straightforward than their travel-card cousins. Yes, you can typically squeeze more value out of the travel card programs, but for many people, the comparative simplicity of the cash back rewards is worth it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere are some ways to make the most of a cash back credit card with rewards tiers, rotating categories, or bonus categories.Understand the higher-rate categories and whether they are right for youMaybe this goes without saying, but start by making sure you understand which categories offer higher-rate rewards. Depending on the card, the categories that could offer higher rewards rates might include:Travel spendingGasGrocery shoppingDining out \\\\/ takeoutStreaming servicesDrugstoresOnline shoppingWhen you are clear on which categories offer higher rewards, you then need to consider whether those categories actually fit your typical spending.For instance, I do a lot of grocery shopping for my family, but much of it happens at Costco and Walmart. So if I want to earn higher rewards for that spending, I have to match it up to a card that has higher rewards for groceries, but doesn\\\\u2019t exclude retailers like Walmart and Target or club retailers like Costco (as some grocery rewards programs do).When considering what this means for the card or cards you\\\\u2019ll carry, you need to figure out what actually fits your lifestyle. I ended up with cards that specifically reward Costco and Walmart spending. This works well for me in my mix of cards, but the total number of cards you\\\\u2019re juggling does increase complexity and the number of bills you need to manage. If you want to keep it simpler, sticking with a fewer number of cards that reward your very highest spend categories can work well.Know the terms of your rewards programRewards programs do have rules, so it\\\\u2019s important that you understand those rules. Here are a few that are critical to keep an eye on:Bonus category caps: In some cases, high rewards rates in bonus or high-rate categories are capped. This might mean, for example, that the first $1,000 in a quarter can earn at the higher rate, but everything after that bumps down to a lower rate.Bonus category enrollment: Some cards, especially when it\\\\u2019s a rotating bonus category, require that you enroll to actually get the higher bonus-category rates.Bonus category definitions: This may fall into the \\\\u201cunderstand the rewards program\\\\u201d bit, but it bears repeating. You will only get the higher rewards rates on spending that actually qualifies, so it\\\\u2019s important to really understand what qualifies for certain bonus categories. If the bonus category is \\\\u201ctravel\\\\u201d it may or may not include flights, so you need to know that. If the category is \\\\u201cgroceries\\\\u201d it may or may not include big-box retailers like Target that also sell groceries, so it\\\\u2019s important to know this as well.Planning big or non-urgent purchasesDon\\\\u2019t spend money that you don\\\\u2019t need to in order to earn rewards. That\\\\u2019s an important one. But, when you do need (or want) to spend on something that isn\\\\u2019t urgent, a little planning can make a big difference in your card rewards.If you have a cash back card with a tiered rewards program and no caps on earning rewards, this shouldn\\\\u2019t be an issue \\\\u2013 if the spending fits into a high-rate category, you should be good to go.On the other hand, if you have rotating bonus categories or a choice of bonus categories, larger, non-urgent purchases, you could delay those until you are in a window where those purchases would qualify for a higher rewards rate. Likewise, if the higher-rate category where your planned purchases fall has a monthly or quarterly cap, you could spread out the purchases so that you earn the higher rate for all of the spending, rather than getting capped after some and earning a lower rate on the rest.(As an added advantage of doing this, I\\\\u2019ve often found that when I put off any spending, I tend to find that some of it wasn\\\\u2019t as necessary as I thought it was. Extra savings win!)Using multiple cash back cardsOne other great way to maximize your rewards when using cash back systems is to use multiple cards. What this allows you to do is overlap cards so that you earn higher rates on more categories than any single card offers. This works a lot better for cash back cards than travel cards because you don\\\\u2019t have to worry about sticking within points systems.The way I think about this is to start with a card with a solid everyday rate of cash back. This is the card I can pull out whenever my spending doesn\\\\u2019t fit a high-rate category. Then I put together cards with higher-rate categories that fit my biggest spending categories. In my case, I have cards that offer higher rates on travel spending, gas, Costco shopping, Walmart shopping, Amazon.com shopping, non-Amazon online shopping, and dining out. One of my bonus category cards has a good enough baseline rate that I use it for the spending that doesn\\\\u2019t fit these categories.Note that while many programs have high-rate categories that are chosen for you or pre-defined, some allow you to choose. This can be particularly helpful when trying to put together multiple cards that work together because you can use the choice-category card to fill in a gap from the other cards\\\\u2019 programs.If you want to learn more about all of the ins and outs of cash back cards as well as all of our picks across the category, check out our page specifically on the best cash back credit cards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to choose the rewards credit card that\\'s best for you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou don\\\\u2019t want just any rewards card. You want the rewards card that\\\\u2019s going to work well for you.Fortunately, there\\\\u2019s one simple thing to consider that will help you make the best choice: How much effort will you put into your credit card?Rewards credit cards can be a very simple way to earn rewards and cash back for your spending. Or they can be a fun game of maximizing points and optimizing the use of perks.Here\\\\u2019s a breakdown of the choices to make based on whether you want to keep it simple or get more involved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKeep it simple\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOptimize\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRewards credit card type\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCash back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoints \\\\/ Travel Rewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoints program\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlat-rate\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTiered\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnnual fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNo\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaybe (value dependent)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPerks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLess focus\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCarefully consider perks that give you value\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou don\\\\u2019t have to choose everything from one column. But the more you just want to sit back while your credit card earns rewards, the more you should choose from the \\\\u201ckeep it simple\\\\u201d column. And the more you want to earn the most rewards and get the biggest benefits from card perks, the more the \\\\u201coptimize\\\\u201d column may be right for you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCredit card rewards comparison\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow that you know where you fall on the simple\\\\/complicated spectrum, let\\\\u2019s compare the four main types of rewards credit cards: cash back credit cards, travel rewards credit cards, points credit cards, and retail rewards credit cards.Travel rewards credit cardsIf traveling is one of your favorite things, travel credit cards are basically made for you. These cards earn rewards that you can use to cover travel purchases like airfare or hotel stays.These fall into the more complicated group of rewards credit cards, but can also be some of the most lucrative cards.There are two main sub-types of travel reward credit cards: general (or issuer branded) cards and co-branded cards.General travel rewards credit cards are great because they\\\\u2019re more flexible. This type of travel card will allow you to rack up points on your travel even if you don\\\\u2019t have a preferred airline or hotel. Points can often be used to book travel through issuer travel portals, converted into points in airline or hotel rewards systems, or even converted into gift cards or statement credits (though you won\\\\u2019t get the best value this way).Co-branded travel rewards cards are the opposite. They are best when you do have a preferred airline or hotel. These cards are issued via partnerships between an issuing bank and an airline or hotel. These credit cards typically offer big points for booking with the co-branded airline or hotel and usually pay out in the form of that company\\\\u2019s loyalty points system. They also often have perks directly related to the travel company \\\\u2013 for instance, free checked bags for an airline card or room upgrades for a hotel card.Travel Rewards at a Glance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoints\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRedemption options\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan be very flexible, usually most value from travel purchases\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPerks and benefits\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan include free checked baggage, airport lounge access, upgraded status, various types of travel insurance, rebates for travel-related fees\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSign-up bonuses\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOften included, typically an amount of points earned after spending a certain amount in the first few months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnnual fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere are cards with no fee, the best rewards and perks are with cards that carry a fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCOMPARE MORE TOP PICKS: Best Travel Rewards Credit CardsCash back credit cardsCash back credit cards are generally as easy as it gets in the world of rewards cards. These cards typically give users a percentage of their spending back in the form of cash or something very similar to cash, like a statement credit.The two main types of cash back credit cards are flat-rate cash back cards and tiered or bonus category cards.If cash back cards are simple, flat-rate cash back cards are the simplest of simple. These credit cards pay a fixed rate of cash back on all purchases, regardless of the category. There\\\\u2019s no need to track bonus categories or tiers, so this can be a great choice for those that want to earn rewards without having to do a lot of extra work.On the other hand, tiered or bonus category cash back cards offer different percentage payouts depending on the spending category. Cardholders may get a low flat rate percentage on most spending, for instance 1%, but then get a higher rate of 3% or even 5% on certain categories such as groceries, gas, or dining. It does require you to do a bit more work in order to match the card to your spending, but the high-tier and bonus category rewards for these cards usually allow higher cash back earning versus flat-rate cards.Cash back credit cards at a glance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCash back\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRedemption options\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUsually statement credits, direct deposit, or gift cards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPerks and benefits\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVaries by card but may include purchase protection, extended warranty, access to exclusive events or discounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSign-up bonuses\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOften included, typically in the form of a cash bonus or percentage match after spending a certain amount in the first few months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnnual fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMany cards have no fee, but some with higher cash back rates and better perks may have a fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoints credit cardsPoints credit cards are good if you like flexibility. With points cards you earn points that can be redeemed for a wide variety of rewards including travel, merchandise, gift cards, and cash back.It\\\\u2019s possible to optimize how you earn points and then how you redeem them on the other end. This can help you make the most of the rewards you get back from your everyday spending. However, the flexibility of points credit cards also means that if you don\\\\u2019t worry about how to optimally redeem your points, you can also convert to a simple cash-back reward.Like other cards in rewards category, points credit cards can be split into flexible points cards and category-specific points cards. Flexible points cards will usually offer a number of points per dollar spent across all of your spending. Category-specific cards will have either fixed or rotating categories that award more points for spending within certain categories.Points credit cards at a glance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoints\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRedemption options\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTravel, merchandise, gift cards, cash back, sometimes transfer to partner loyalty programs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPerks and benefits\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMay include travel insurance, purchase protection, extended warranty, exclusive events or discounts, and various types of travel benefits\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSign-up bonuses\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOften included, typically a specific number of points earned after spending a certain amount in the first few months\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnnual fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVaries widely; some cards have no fee, while others with premium perks and higher rewards rates may carry a fee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCOMPARE MORE TOP PICKS: Best Cash Back Credit CardsStore credit cardsStore credit cards are a type of rewards card I often don\\'t recommend for most people. A travel or cash rewards credit card is usually a much better deal, especially if you want a single-card wallet. But store cards are everywhere, and some have their uses if you shop at the store often, so it\\'s worth knowing how they work.Most store cards earn rewards you can redeem with that store for a gift card. There are exceptions, like the Costco Anywhere Visa\\\\u00ae Card by Citi, which earns cash back. And some store cards offer a discount on purchases or zero-interest financing instead of rewards.A store card can be \\\\\"closed-loop\\\\\" or \\\\\"open-loop.\\\\\" Closed-loop store cards only work at that retailer and any related brands. Open-loop store cards can be used with other merchants. Some stores only offer one of the two, and others offer both options. When stores offer both, they generally approve customers with lower credit scores for closed-loop cards. Applicants with better credit can qualify for open-loop cards.For example, let\\'s say you apply for a T.J. Maxx credit card. Any of the following could happen:You\\'re approved for the TJX Rewards\\\\u00ae Credit Card. This is a closed-loop card, meaning you can only use it at T.J. Maxx and its other brands.You\\'re approved for the TJX Rewards\\\\u00ae Platinum Mastercard\\\\u00ae. This is an open-loop card that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted.You\\'re not approved for any of the T.J.

Always pay by card so you earn rewards on your spending.Stick to your budget: A common mistake is making unnecessary purchases, using rewards to justify it. Don\\'t let credit card rewards convince you to overspend.Pay off your credit card every month: Credit card interest almost always costs more than any rewards you earn. Avoid this by always paying your entire statement balance.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat can you do with credit card rewards?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter earning credit card rewards, you can redeem them through the card\\'s rewards program. The ways you can redeem them depend on the card. Here are the most common redemption options for the best points credit card:Get cash back, as a statement credit on your credit card bill, a direct deposit to a bank account, or as a check.Use them for travel through the card issuer\\'s travel portal, as a statement credit toward previous travel purchases, or by transferring them to airline or hotel loyalty programs.Redeem them for store gift cards.Redeem them for products or services.When you log in to your online account, there should be a clear option to redeem rewards. Choose this to see what your redemption options are and pick the one you want.Check how much value you get with each redemption method. People sometimes assume they get the same value no matter how they use their rewards. This is a common mistake that can cost you money. The value often depends on how you use your rewards. For example, if your card earns travel points, you may also be able to redeem them for cash back, but at a much lower rate per point.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShould I get a rewards credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou should get a rewards credit card if you have a good credit score and will pay the bill in full every month.Rewards cards are usually a great choice. You\\'re going to pay for purchases anyway. Why not use a rewards card to get something back on that money you\\'re spending? There are only a couple of situations where the best points credit card isn\\'t the right fit:You don\\'t have a good credit score: Learn how to increase your credit score and work on that first. It usually takes a FICO\\\\u00ae Score of at least 670 to get any of the best rewards credit cards. By improving your credit, you can qualify for rewards cards that offer much more value.You won\\'t pay in full every month: Every month you carry a balance, the card issuer can charge you credit card interest. The cost of interest almost always outweighs your rewards.Here are the pros and cons of having a rewards credit card:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProsEarn rewards on purchasesMany offer welcome bonusesTypically include complimentary shopping and travel protectionsCan build your credit when you consistently pay your bill in full\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsOften have high APRsCan encourage you to spend more moneyMay charge an annual feeTop rewards cards are only available to consumers with good credit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlternatives to the best credit cards for rewards\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour financial situation may call for a different type of credit card. Here are a few common situations where a rewards credit card isn\\'t the right choice, along with what type of card to pick instead.If you won\\'t be able to pay in full, get a credit card with a 0% intro APR on purchases. The credit card company won\\'t charge you interest during your card\\'s introductory period. On a card with a 15-month 0% intro APR, that means no interest charges for the first 15 months.CHECK OUT THE LONGEST OFFERS: Best 0% APR Credit CardsIf you\\'re working on your credit score, find a card aimed at people in your score range. First, learn about how to find out your credit score.

Every eligible purchase adds to your rewards balance, and you can then redeem your rewards with the credit card issuer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I do a credit card rewards comparison?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo compare rewards credit cards, look at their rewards rates, bonus offers, annual fees, and any additional benefits they offer. These are the features that have the most impact on the value a card offers.You may also want to decide on one type of rewards card first, such as a travel card or a cash back card. If you know you want a specific type of card, then you can save time by only looking at cards in that category.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the best credit card for rewards?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe best rewards credit card has a redemption method that offers the most value. This can vary depending on which rewards credit card you have. For example, travel cards usually provide the most value when redeeming rewards for travel, whereas cash back cards are designed for cash back redemptions.When you have a rewards credit card, make sure you review the different redemption methods so you can choose the best one.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I make the most of a rewards credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo make the most of a rewards credit card, use it for every purchase to earn as much back as you can. However, don\\'t make unnecessary purchases just because your card earns rewards. Follow your usual spending habits. Last but not least, always pay the full statement balance on your credit card to avoid interest charges.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a rewards credit card?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA credit card with reward points earns cash back, points, miles, or some other type of reward for purchases. The amount you earn depends on the card and, in some cases, the spending category. For example, there are cards that offer a flat rate of 2% on purchases. Others offer higher rates in some categories, such as 3% on groceries.Every eligible purchase adds to your reward balance. So, if you spend $100 on a card offering 2% cash back, you\\'d earn $2 in rewards. You can redeem rewards when you have enough to meet the redemption minimum, if there is one. Fortunately, many of the best rewards credit cards don\\'t have a minimum, so you can redeem rewards anytime.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAsk the experts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichael Shipman, CPA\\\\n\\\\nAssistant Professor for Accounting, Mount Aloysius College\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith high gas prices, should consumers consider using credit cards that provide rewards to pay for gas?One should never get a credit card for a \\\\\"non-credit reason.\\\\\" In the tax world, we have the saying, \\\\\"The tax tail should never wag the economic dog.\\\\\" This means that a company should not do something solely for tax reasons, but rather, should have a good business reason for a course of action. The same can be said of credit cards. This said, if you are opening a new line of credit during a time of high gas prices (whether it be because you need a credit card or an additional credit card, or have to close one for a good reason and are now looking for another), getting and using a credit card that provides rewards to pay for gas could be better than the other usual reward opportunities! What should consumers know when deciding between a general cash back credit card vs. a gas company credit card?Consumers should know the details of each reward opportunity. For example, I would want to know what I can and cannot get cash back on, how often I can get cash back, at what rate I get cash back, if there is a limit on how much cash I can get back, and if there are any other restrictions on the card. This line of reasoning applies to gas company credit cards as well: Is it just the one company I can get my gas bill reduced at? How often can I use it? At what rate is my gas reduced? Is there a limit on how much my gas bill is reduced, and are there any other restrictions on the card? Lastly, remember, even though the gas company credit card sounds like a good idea now, it can only help with gas, as opposed to the general cash back credit card likely providing cash back for use at your discretion. Are there any benefits or drawbacks to companies that advertise money back per gallon?The obvious benefit is that you can reduce your gas bill. As far as I can tell, that is where the benefits end. One drawback is that you may get a gas company credit card for a company that routinely has more expensive gas than one of its competitors in your area. A similar drawback is that by getting this credit card, you are likely influencing yourself to buy most, if not all, of your gas from one company, which may or may not always be the best economic decision. This is similar to loyalty cards for gas chains (Sheetz, Wawa, etc.), with the difference that loyalty cards do not really have consequences. Credit cards do have consequences, and it is important to read the fine print on gas company credit card offers like any others, as you may find the gas company card has a lower interest rate (benefit), but you may also find (and this sounds more likely, in my opinion) a higher interest rate. Whatever you decide, always remember to monitor your credit card bills carefully, and if possible, pay off your balance every month! \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJoseph Stasio\\\\n\\\\nAssociate Professor, Marketing, Merrimack College\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith high gas prices, should consumers consider using credit cards that provide rewards to pay for gas? It is important to understand that prices fluctuate given market conditions. Right now, gas prices along with many other consumer products are experiencing abnormally high prices. This is due to a number of factors including unusually high demand, labor shortages, and supply chain irregularities, all causing inflation. Decisions involving credit card usage tied to gas purchases should involve this understanding. So, using credit cards that reward gas purchases will be advantageous in the short run, but not so much when gas prices return to a more normal range. Of course, if consumers have different credit cards to use, then they can provide the best return on purchases after gas prices come down and they offer a better return on their buying behavior.What should consumers know when deciding between a general cash back credit card vs. a gas company credit card?The answer to this question is provided in question one. The key is to understand market conditions and their impact on prices. Generally speaking, consumers should have a few credit cards. For example, not all businesses accept either Discover Cards or Amex Cards. Depending on the amount of expenditures people experience each month and whether they carry a balance or pay off the total amount each month, consumers can decide which cards to use that will provide them the best return on their purchases. It is important for consumers to understand their own purchase behavior and judiciously use their credit cards. Gas company credit card decisions should be made in this context.Are there any benefits or drawbacks to companies that advertise money back per gallon?Companies that advertise money back per gallon are really speaking to heavy users of gasoline. They would include people who drive long distances to work each day or people who use their cars to conduct business that involves much travel. Salespeople, truck drivers, etc., fall into this category. If companies do not target their messages to these groups of people, then they are wasting their marketing\\\\/advertising dollars. With social media platforms and the use of digital marketing techniques, companies should learn how best to reach these people and get the most from their marketing dollars. Any other approach is generally not advisable because people who are not heavy users of gasoline will most probably not be interested in these advertisements.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Matt Koppenheffer\\\\n and\\\\u00a0Lyle Daly\\\\nOur Credit Cards Experts\",\"Article Date\":\"October 3, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best Credit Cards for Bad Credit of October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/credit-cards\\\\/bad-credit\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Landlords can use your credit to decide if they\\'ll rent to you. Employers can use it for hiring decisions. In most states, your credit can even determine how much you pay for car insurance. As you can see, a bad credit score means a lot more than just paying higher interest rates on loans.On a positive note, anyone can improve their credit. But to do that, you\\'ll need to understand what causes bad credit in the first place and what it takes to build a better credit score.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is considered a bad credit score?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBad credit scores range from 300 to 579 using the FICO system and 300 to 600 using the VantageScore system. FICO is the most widely used scoring system, and VantageScore is the second most popular. If you\\'re new to credit scores, it\\'s good to understand that there\\'s more than one scoring system -- and that your credit score is a number that ranges from 300 to 850.When you have a bad credit score, you won\\'t have many credit card or loan options. You\\'ll likely only qualify for credit cards and loans that are aimed at applicants who have bad credit.After bad credit, there\\'s fair credit, which is a FICO\\\\u00ae Score between 580 and 669 and a VantageScore between 601 and 660. You can get approved for more financial products once you have fair credit, although you\\'ll still have a more limited selection than consumers with good or excellent credit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to check your credit score\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKnowing your credit score is essential if you want to monitor your financial health and take steps to improve your credit. Plus, it can help guide you in choosing the right credit card to apply for as you begin to consider card options. The good news is it\\'s simple to check your credit score.One way to do so is to use a free credit monitoring and credit score service. You\\'ll need to sign up for one of these services and log in to view your score. Examples include Experian CreditWorks\\\\u2120 Basic and Discover\\\\u00ae Credit Scorecard. These services are free to use and provide you with a FICO\\\\u00ae Score. As a note, Discover doesn\\'t require you to be a cardholder to use their service.Knowing your score can give you a better understanding of where your finances stand and help you make more informed decisions so you can improve your credit score.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFactors that cause bad credit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCertain factors can cause bad credit. Here are some examples:BankruptcyIf you\\'ve filed for bankruptcy or plan to do so, this can be one of the most significant factors that result in bad credit. Depending on the type of bankruptcy you\\'ve filed for, this negative mark will stay on your credit for seven to 10 years. It\\'s important to consider this before filing for bankruptcy.Missing payments and late paymentsPayment history makes up 35% of your credit score. If you\\'re missing payments or making late payments, this can cause bad credit. If you\\'ve made payment mistakes in the past, you can make changes from now on. If you want to improve your credit, be sure to pay your bills in full and on time.High credit utilizationYour credit utilization ratio is how much of your available credit you\\'re using. If you have a high credit utilization (using more than 30% of your total available credit), this can negatively impact your score. It\\'s best to use less of your available credit if you want a higher credit score. Using less available credit also shows that you have a smaller percentage of outstanding debt.Having no credit or minimal creditIf you have little to no credit history, that can be a factor that leads to bad credit. Your best bet is to begin building credit now because the length of your credit history will increase over time, which looks good to creditors.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the effects of bad credit?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe biggest consequence of bad credit is that if you need to apply for anything that requires a credit check, you\\'re much more likely to get declined. Examples include:Credit cardsPersonal loansAuto loansMortgagesHome rental applicationsEven if you get approved, the terms will be worse than they would be for a borrower with good or excellent credit. You may get a credit card, but it won\\'t have much in the way of rewards or benefits. A landlord could rent to you, provided you pay a much larger security deposit.When it comes to loans, it\\'s best to show you an example. Here\\'s how much a 60-month auto loan for $25,000 would cost, using national APR averages, depending on your credit:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFICO SCORE\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMONTHLY PAYMENT\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTOTAL INTEREST\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExcellent (720 or higher)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4.272%\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$463\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$2,809\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPoor (589 or below)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n16.735%\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$618\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$12,065\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData source: MyFICO.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExcellent credit would save you $155 per month, and $9,256 in total interest over the life of the loan.Those are the most obvious effects of bad credit, but they\\'re far from the only ones. Here are some additional challenges you could deal with:Many utilities providers charge security deposits to new customers with subpar credit.Most states allow car insurance companies to charge higher premiums to drivers with lower credit scores.Employers can run a credit check before deciding whether to offer you a job.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan you erase a bad credit history?You can\\'t completely erase a bad credit history -- at least not overnight. But, you do have a couple of options when it comes to removing specific concerns:If something is inaccurate on your credit report and it\\'s having a negative impact on your credit, you can dispute it. You can do this by contacting each of the three credit bureaus to file an official dispute. The Federal Trade Commision has a sample letter that you can use. Your best bet is to send your letter by mail, so that you can track it and have a record of it being sent.If you have a late payment mark on your credit report and you\\'ve been a loyal customer, it\\'s worth reaching out to your creditor to request a goodwill adjustment. They may agree to remove that late payment mark, which can improve your credit history. You can make a request by phone, but sending a letter is an even better idea. A letter gives you a chance to explain in detail why your payment was late.You can also negotiate with your creditor if you\\'re looking to have a poor mark removed and they\\'re not willing to remove it right away. For example, if you still have outstanding debt with the creditor, you may ask if they will remove the poor mark if you pay the balance in full right away.These are a few ways to erase parts of your bad credit history. If none of these options work for you, you\\'ll need to continue to work on improving your credit history by making smart financial choices.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat to look for in a credit card for bad credit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe most important thing to look for in a credit card for bad credit is its fees, but you should also check its APR, its minimum and maximum security deposits, and what kind of credit limit you can expect. Here\\'s an explanation of each item.FeesMost credit cards have fees, but what you don\\'t want are unavoidable fees. Fees for cash advances or balance transfers shouldn\\'t scare you off from a specific credit card -- you can easily avoid both by not making those types of transactions.Fees that should make you think twice are annual fees, monthly maintenance fees, and any other regular fees the card issuer charges no matter what. These are expenses you don\\'t need, especially from a card that probably doesn\\'t have many benefits.APRIdeally, you\\'ll pay your full statement balance and never incur interest charges. But it\\'s also nice to have a credit card that won\\'t gouge you in interest if you ever need to carry a balance. You can calculate your interest payments by using this calculator.Minimum\\\\/maximum security depositWith secured credit cards, you should check what the minimum and maximum security deposit amounts are. The one that\\'s more important for you depends on how much you have saved for a security deposit.If you don\\'t have much saved, you\\'ll need to ensure you can pay a card\\'s minimum deposit amount. If you have solid savings and you\\'d like to pay more up front for a higher credit limit, then you\\'ll need a card that allows a high maximum deposit.Credit limitIf possible, you should research the credit limits a card offers. This information is usually available with secured credit cards, but you can sometimes get it for an unsecured card as well.You don\\'t need a ton of available credit. But if your credit limit is too low, it can be difficult to maintain a low credit utilization ratio, and that can affect your credit score.RewardsNot all credit cards for bad credit offer rewards, but some do. As you consider your options, you may want to prioritize cards that offer rewards because they can provide value to you.You can expect to earn anywhere from 1% to 3% cash back for most credit cards for bad credit with rewards potential. It\\'s worth noting that cards that offer higher rewards rates may have a cap on how much you can earn. You may be able to earn unlimited rewards at a lower earning rate. Remember, some cards for bad credit offer no rewards at all.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to get a credit card with bad credit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to get a credit card with bad credit, your best bet is to see if you can get prequalified for a card. That way, you can make sure you will be eligible for a card without hurting your credit score with a credit check, only to find that you don\\'t qualify.While it depends on the card issuer, most of the major credit card companies have prequalification pages on their websites that let you check offers you\\'ll likely be approved for.To find out if you prequalify, you\\'ll just need to enter some basic personal information. Most card issuers ask for at least some of the following:Full nameAddressDate of birthLast four digits of your Social Security numberOnce you\\'ve submitted the required information, you\\'ll see any cards that you have a good chance of qualifying for with that card issuer. Remember that this doesn\\'t guarantee your application will be approved.If you\\'re not able to get prequalified for a credit card for bad credit, it\\'s a good idea to take some time to work on improving your credit. Ready to get started? Here\\'s how to apply for a credit card and get approved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to improve your creditYou can improve your credit score with time and effort. Remember that there is no instant fix. You can\\'t build credit quickly, but you can build it up over time. In order to do this, you need to understand the elements that make up your credit score. Working on each of these can allow you to improve your credit and increase your credit score.Here are the five factors used to calculate your FICO\\\\u00ae Score and how you can get high marks in each one:Payment history (35%): On-time payments are the key to excellent credit. While you can\\'t undo previous late payments on your credit file, you can avoid late payments in the future. That\\'s the number one habit you need to raise your credit score.Credit utilization (30%): Your credit utilization is the sum of your credit balances divided by your combined credit limit. For example, if you have one credit card with a balance of $200 and a limit of $500, then your credit utilization is 40%. The lower you can keep this number, the better. A good goal is to always have your credit utilization below 30%. If yours is higher, then you should focus on paying off debt.Length of credit history (15%): Creditors will obviously consider a borrower who has had a credit card for 20 years to be less risky than one who has only been using credit for three months. The best way to improve in this area is to open a no-annual-fee card and keep it open forever.Credit mix (10%): It gives you a slight credit score advantage if you have both revolving credit, such as credit cards, and an installment loan on your credit file, instead of just one of the two. But since this has only a small impact on your credit score, you shouldn\\'t take out a loan solely to boost your credit. You can attain an excellent credit score even if you only use credit cards.New credit inquiries (10%): When a company looks at your credit report to make a credit decision, this inquiry is reported on your credit report for two years. Credit inquiries only affect your FICO\\\\u00ae Score for one year, though. Don\\'t avoid opening a new account just because of the small impact to your credit score, but don\\'t open a bunch of accounts in quick succession, either.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan I get a credit card without a bank account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHaving a bank account is not a requirement when applying for a credit card. However, application requirements can vary by credit card company, so you may need a bank account to get approved for certain cards.Even though a bank account isn\\'t required to get a credit card, it does make your credit card payments more convenient. Just about every credit card company lets you pay online if you have a bank account. You can make an online payment that counts toward your bill that same day, so you don\\'t need to worry about making a payment days in advance. Another option is to set up autopay.If you don\\'t have a bank account, you\\'ll need to find an alternate payment method. There are other options available. For example, you could pay by mail using a money order, or you could pay in cash if your credit card company has a branch in your area. But there\\'s nothing as convenient as paying online. To simplify your payments and better protect your savings, it makes sense to open a bank account.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the easiest credit card to get with bad credit?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe easiest credit card to get when you have bad credit is a card that is marketed towards people with bad credit. These cards have less strict requirements in place for applicants. You\\'ll be more likely to get approved for a credit card for bad credit if you have a lower credit score, poor credit history, or limited credit.Some bad credit cards have easier approval odds than others. Here is one option:OpenSky\\\\u00ae Secured Visa\\\\u00ae Credit Card: While this is a secured credit card and will require you to make a deposit before using it, this card has a low annual fee and is a good choice for people who are rebuilding their credit or who have very limited credit. There is no credit check requirement when going through the application process -- making it a good option for many.If you\\'ve unsuccessfully tried to get other secured cards with no annual fee or any other credit card for bad credit, this one may be an easier and better option for you to consider.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlternatives to credit cards for bad credit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf a credit card for bad credit isn\\'t for you, there are some other options to explore.Secured loan: A secured loan is a type of loan you can get when you put something of value, such as a car or home, up for collateral. If you\\'re having trouble qualifying for a personal loan, a secured loan could be a good option to help you rebuild credit. However, it\\'s important to remember that the lender can sell your collateral to pay back the loan if you miss payments. For more options and information, check out the best personal loans for bad credit.Subprime credit card: In fact, you may receive offers in the mail inviting you to apply for these. Subprime credit cards typically have fees that end up costing you a lot of money. Take, for example, the First Access VISA\\\\u00ae Credit Card. There\\'s a $95 program fee to open the card. You pay a $75 annual fee the first year. That drops to $48 annually going forward, but in year two, you also pay a $6.25 monthly servicing fee, totaling $75 annually.To avoid all these extra fees and to know what you\\'re getting into before you apply for a card, check the fee disclosure of any card you\\'re considering. If there are fees just to keep the card open, it\\'s probably not worth the cost.Want to learn more?

Is there a range or situation when it might be more beneficial?I\\\\u2019m not a believer in building credit simply for credit\\\\u2019s sake. Still, having good credit is about more than just getting the best interest rate on a loan.Your credit rating affects your car insurance, so if you\\\\u2019re getting ready to purchase a vehicle or switch car insurance policies, you should meet with a financial counselor.Your credit history might be part of a background check the next time you apply for a job, so meeting with a financial counselor before switching jobs or careers could be helpful in landing your dream position.Most property managers will set minimum credit scores for applicant eligibility, so speaking with a financial counselor before moving could help you get into a better place to live. Plus, your credit rating determines how much, if any, you will have to put into a utility\\\\u2019s security deposit.If you\\\\u2019re thinking about buying a home, you should reach out to a financial counselor ahead of time to put together a plan for building your credit rating. It could mean the difference of tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand dollars of interest saved over the life of a 30-year mortgage. Unfortunately, most homebuyers seek credit advice from their realtor or, at best, their mortgage officer. Realtors tend to have no formal training in consumer credit issues. Loan officers, while they work with credit, focus more on selling and processing loans than on building a customer\\\\u2019s credit. I\\\\u2019ve heard nightmare stories from neighbors and clients of bad credit advice given by a well-intentioned but poorly informed lender or realtor. Seek out a financial counselor or a credit counselor instead.If you\\\\u2019re preparing to get married, you might benefit from a meeting with a financial counselor to create a plan to build or rebuild your credit for upcoming changes to your housing, such as moving into a new apartment or purchasing a home.For those struggling in their marriage or relationship with a partner, meeting with a financial counselor can bring an unbiased and dispassionate view to discussions about money in the relationship.Anyone headed for a divorce should meet with a financial counselor to understand the potential credit-related problems surrounding the household separation and even the divorce decree. Too many divorcees believe creditors are bound by the divorce decree, but they aren\\\\u2019t. If your names are on the account, you are ultimately responsible for making the monthly payment, regardless of what the divorce decree says.If you\\\\u2019re getting ready to graduate from college or are a recent college graduate, meeting with a financial counselor can help bust harmful myths about how and when to build your credit.The best time to reach out to a financial counselor is now, whether:things seem to be going well financially but you\\\\u2019d like unbiased, third-party insight to continue that progressthings are going poorly with your credit, and you\\\\u2019re not sure whom to trust with your questions about rebuilding your rating or cleaning up your historyyou\\\\u2019re just getting by but you know you have room to improve your credit scoreTypically, consumers tend to reach out to financial counselors in times of crisis, such as:when they\\\\u2019re about to or have already missed a bill paymentwhen they\\'ve been contacted by a collection agencywhen they\\'re facing foreclosure or repossessionwhen they\\'ve maxed out their credit cards due to medical emergencies or consumer overspendingHow long does it typically take to improve credit with a financial counselor?Depending on the type of issue dragging your credit down, you might see your credit score improve in a matter of a couple weeks or six to nine months. Correcting errors on your credit report can have an almost overnight impact on your rating. Using free products like Experian Boost can improve your credit immediately. Overcoming the negative impacts of years of spending issues and payment histories, though, can take up to a year or more to counter with positive credit-related behaviors.How do financial counselors differ from advisors and planners?Unfortunately, the basic term \\\\u201cfinancial counselor\\\\u201d has no licensing requirements, no copyright or trademark protection, and no exact definition. It has different meanings in different situations. Although a bit oversimplified, financial counselors tend to work with their clients to improve their day-to-day, month-to-month financial behaviors and choices, such as budgeting, credit building, debt elimination, and saving for emergencies and goals. In many cases, anyone can call themselves a financial counselor and not be in violation of any state regulations or licensing standards. That\\\\u2019s one reason I would always recommend you look for a specific type of financial counselor. Accredited Financial Counselors\\\\u00ae (AFC), on the other hand, offer counseling on budgeting, credit building, debt elimination, and consumer behaviors through private practice or through a sponsoring organization, such as a military base, university, or nonprofit. They must have 1,000 hours of experience and pass a rigorous test in order to use the title of AFC. (Disclaimer: I\\\\u2019m an AFC.)Finally, financial advisors and planners are in the business of offering advice about or selling products to help their clients build wealth long-term. While financial advisors and planners require licenses to recommend and sell securities, insurance, and other financial products, AFCs do not sell or recommend products for commissions. What are common misconceptions around working with a financial counselor?One common misconception about working with a financial counselor is they only work with the extremes: the very rich or those in financial need. The truth is that most households would benefit from working with a financial counselor. According to Career Builder, nearly 80% of workers earning less than $100,000 a year live paycheck to paycheck even before the coronavirus pandemic. Plus, the Federal Reserve reports that 2 in 5 American households are unable to come up with $400 in an emergency without affecting their ability to pay their regular bills. Therefore, most American adults could use financial counseling, whether it involves building or rebuilding their credit rating, accelerating their debt elimination plans, or putting barriers in place to stop impulse spending.Another misconception is that financial counselors charge large fees. Many Accredited Financial Counselors (AFCs) provide their services at no charge through a nonprofit, military base, or other organization. Others have set up their own private practice, giving them greater latitude in the services they provide. Still, their fees are reasonable for the short- and long-term financial benefits they provide.Many people think meeting with a financial counselor would be too embarrassing or humiliating. But there is no shame in wanting to improve your situation. For example, AFCs are trained to avoid making the consumer feel ashamed of their previous behavior. Shame and embarrassment do not lead to positive changes. AFCs focus on future goals and objectives, not on past mistakes or choices.Some people believe they have to get super organized with all their financial documents and bills before meeting with a financial counselor. Actually, financial counselors can help simplify the process of organizing household finances by helping to prioritize tasks and by providing recommendations for helpful apps and other tools.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan I get a credit card without a bank account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes, it\\'s possible to get a credit card without a bank account. However, some card issuers may require you to have one in order to be approved for a card. It\\'ll be easier to pay your credit bill if you do have a bank account, and you may qualify for more cards with one.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan I get a credit card if I\\'ve declared bankruptcy?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes, you can get a credit card after bankruptcy. It\\'s important to remember that bankruptcy does negatively impact your credit situation. Because of this, you may qualify for less credit cards. You may need to apply for a secured credit card, which requires you to pay a deposit before using the card. In many cases, this deposit is equal to your starting credit limit. Another option is to apply for a subprime credit card. These cards have many more fees attached to them when compared with other cards. Because of these extra fees, these kinds of cards usually aren\\'t the best choice.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can I improve my credit score?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere are a few ways that you can improve your credit score. Continuing to make on-time payments, keeping your credit card utilization low, and always paying at least the minimum amount due are all good ways to improve your financial habits and improve your credit score.If you don\\'t yet have a credit card, getting one is another way to improve your score. If you have a low score, you can apply for a credit card for bad credit. Make sure that you use the credit card regularly, even for small charges, and make all payments on time. With time and effort, you can improve your credit score.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Natasha Etzel\\\\nOur Credit Cards Expert\",\"Article Date\":\"August 15, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best High Yield Savings Accounts of October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/banks\\\\/best-savings-accounts\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Image source: Liz Wilson\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPY: up to 4.50%Bonus: up to $250 (with direct deposit)Why we picked it: Not only does this savings account offer a strong APY, but the linked checking account has a very impressive APY for a checking account too. Plus, there\\\\u2019s the opportunity for a $250 bonus \\\\u2013 a very rare perk.What we think you need to know about SoFi Checking and Savings:For those that are planning to set up direct deposit with their new account, we think SoFi Checking and Savings is hard to beat. The savings account offers a high APY of up to 4.50% with direct deposit, which is very competitive with other accounts on our list (though others don\\\\u2019t require direct deposit). You can also earn the maximum APY by depositing $5,000 or more every 30 days.Meanwhile, the linked checking account offers a 0.50% APY. Frankly, it\\\\u2019s the kind of combo that could make it worthwhile to switch banking relationships.Another unique feature of this offer is the bonus: users can earn a $250 cash bonus when they set up direct deposit, and when qualifying direct deposits within 25 days total $5,000 or more (the bonus drops to $50 if direct deposits in 25 days are at a lower level of $1,000.00 - $4,999.99)First-hand review from one of our employees, who uses SoFi personally:\\\\\"I was interested in an online bank since I\\\\u2019d seen that a lot of them offered higher APYs than traditional banks. We chose to go with SoFi because they offered some of the highest rates and had good reviews. Overall, they have been a good fit for us. Transfers are seamless and the app is easy to navigate and keep track of activity with. My only complaint so far has been that the first time I tried to deposit a check (an insurance reimbursement), they temporarily locked our account due to not recognizing the check issuer, and the process of getting it unlocked with customer service was frustrating. Since then I have had no issues.\\\\\"-Liz Wilson, Software Developer here at The Ascent, a Motley Fool ServicePros:One of the rare accounts to offer a bonus (with direct deposit)Competitive APY on both savings and checking (with direct deposit)No account feesBaseline FDIC insurance of up to $250,000, and they also offer the SoFi Insured Deposit Program which allows for FDIC insurance on deposits up to $2 million (opt-in required)Cons:Direct deposit is required for the bonusDirect deposit or large monthly deposits are required for the higher APYClick here to open an account: SoFi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Express National Bank\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Express Savings Platform. Image source: Author\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPY: 4.30%Why we picked it: We think you can feel good about stashing your money at American Express National Bank \\\\u2013 a high yield savings account with a strong APY and a trustworthy, safe brand.What we think you need to know: While it may not be the highest APY on our best savings accounts list, American Express still sports a well-above-average rate and a strong brand. We can\\\\u2019t fault people that may not want to squeeze every last penny out of their interest rate, and would rather opt for a company like American Express with a strong reputation and one that is likely not going to play games with your APY. Further, this account sports no monthly fees and 24\\\\/7 customer support.In terms of what could be improved, as an online bank it offers no ATM card; funds can be withdrawn or transferred through its website or mobile app.First-hand review of American Express\\\\u00ae High Yield Savings from one of our employees, who uses the account personally:\\\\\"I\\\\u2019ve personally been using my American Express savings account for over 3 years. I chose Amex because of their competitive rates coupled with the strength of a well known brand. Their online portal easily links between credit and bank accounts making it simple to track everything in one place.\\\\\"\\\\u2013Employee here at The Ascent, A Motley Fool ServicePros:Extra safety of a rock-solid brand and reputationCompetitive APYNo monthly feesNo limit on number or amount of withdrawalsFDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Slightly higher APY is available elsewhere, though those accounts may have less rate stabilityNo ATM cardClick here to open an account: American Express\\\\u00ae High Yield Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover Online Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover Online Savings platform. Image source: Ethan Mellin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPY: 4.30%Bonus: Up to $200 with qualifying depositsWhy we picked it: While it may not be the highest APY on this list, Discover Online Savings features an excellent rate and we think this account excels pretty much everywhere else too.What we think you need to know: we think Discover Online Savings is a great pick for anyone who wants an account with a high APY that they don\\'t need to think about. While it\\'s not exactly the highest rate at every point in time, you can feel good that you\\\\u2019ll be earning a near-top-of-market rate for a while to come. You\\\\u2019ll also avoid many common bank fees and despite it being an online bank, you have plenty of deposit and withdraw options.Discover has a limit of 6 withdrawals and transfers per month, which is pretty good, and they are not even enforcing that rule right now.For a limited time, earn $150 when you open your first Discover Online Savings account and deposit at least $15,000 within 30 days of the account open date. You can earn $200 with a similarly qualifying deposit of at least $25,000. Enter offer code TMF923 when applying. This offer ends 12\\\\/14\\\\/23.

However, I am also a Discover Credit Card & Checking account-holder, so having everything in one easy-to-use mobile app makes it extremely easy to manage my finances.

Image source: Author\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPY:CIT Platinum Savings: 5.05% APY for balances of $5,000 or moreCIT Savings Connect: 4.65% APYWhy we picked it: These are no-frills high-interest savings accounts offering some of the highest APY\\\\u2019s on the market today.Important note: CIT offers two high-yield savings accounts: the CIT Platinum Savings account with a higher APY but with a deposit requirement of $5,000, and the CIT Savings Connect account with a slightly lower APY but only requiring $100 to open the account. So those depositing over $5,000 should go with CIT Platinum Savings, and those depositing under $5,000 should go with CIT Savings Connect.My first-hand review:I have personally been using CIT Bank savings accounts for years, and I\\\\u2019ve had a good experience with the company overall. The high APY (annual percentage yield) is what attracted me to the account originally, and I\\\\u2019m still earning a very competitive rate there. This is also the main reason our experts included it on this list of our best high yield savings accounts.My first-hand experience with the platform and its features has been good, though it is important to note that the features are relatively simple and you shouldn\\\\u2019t expect all the bells and whistles of a larger bank (the screenshot above that I took shows what the platform looks like). For me, this is worth the trade-off for the higher interest rate. I\\\\u2019ve found that it is easy to wire money in and out of the platform.My only real negative thing I\\\\u2019ve experienced with CIT is that they lowered the APY on my account out of the blue last summer. This happened when they created a new account, the Savings Connect account you see here, which became the CIT account with the highest rate. It was easy enough for me to switch over to Savings Connect to earn the higher APY, but I didn\\\\u2019t appreciate them not auto-enrolling me in this new account. This isn\\\\u2019t a deal-breaker for me as this hasn\\\\u2019t happened again, CIT has been good otherwise, and the APY is strong. But if you open an account just make sure to keep an eye on it so you\\\\u2019re earning the highest APY.Pros:High APYNo account feesUnlimited transfers and withdrawals ($250k limit per day)FDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Past history of APYs for existing accounts not always being increased when new accounts with higher APYs are launched (though this has not been an issue lately)There is a minimum deposit required to open an account, though it\\\\u2019s just $100\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCapital One 360 Performance Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCapital One Performance Savings Platform. Image source: Matt Koppenheffer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPY: 4.30%Why we like it: Like the other accounts on this list, Capital One 360 Performance Savings sports a strong APY. But what sets it apart from many others is branch locations and full-service banking support.What we think you need to know: Capital One 360 Performance Savings is a great high yield savings account option for anyone looking for a strong brand, easy-to-use platform, and a plethora of branch locations (if you live near one). It offers a highly competitive interest rate, though not always fully at the top of the market.In terms of negatives, while you can take advantage of Capital One branches if you live near one, if you don\\\\u2019t then it could be tricky to access your funds in person (though you can transfer money to a Capital One 360 Checking account for easier access.)First-hand review of Capital One 360 Performance Savings from one of our employees, who uses the account personally:\\\\\"My family and I have enjoyed the convenience of banking with Capital One overall. The accounts are easy to use, the interface is simple, money moves quickly, and while savings rates aren\\'t top of the market, they\\'re much higher than mainline banks.\\\\\"\\\\u2013Matt Koppenheffer, General Manager here at The Ascent, a Motley Fool ServicePros:Branch access if you live near oneExtra safety of a rock-solid brand and reputationNo monthly feesFDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Slightly higher APY is available elsewhere, though those accounts may have less rate stabilityNo direct ATM access if you don\\\\u2019t live near a branchClick here to open an account: Capital One 360 Performance Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs Online Savings Account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarcus By Goldman Sachs Online Savings Account platform. Image source: Johnnie Weathersby III\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPY: 4.30%Why we picked it: We think Marcus is a strong option for anyone wanting a high APY, robust platform, and all backed by a big name bank (Goldman Sachs).What we think you need to know:There\\\\u2019s a reason Marcus won our award for Best Online Savings Account. It features a high APY, no monthly maintenance fees, and excellent U.S. based customer support (during business hours). There is no minimum balance requirement to open an account and like all accounts on this list, it is FDIC insured for at least $250,000 per depositor.One negative of Marcus is that it does not offer direct ATM card access, so if that\\\\u2019s important to you then we think it\\\\u2019s best to look elsewhere on this list.First-hand review from one of our employees, who uses Marcus by Goldman Sachs personally:\\\\\"I love the competitive rates at Marcus and they update the return account holders see on a regular basis. Transfers to and from Marcus are pretty simple and help you avoid wire transfer fees that you may experience with other banks. The referral benefits are great for existing account holders, which can be a pretty sweet deal if you want to help your family and friends out, too.\\\\\"\\\\u2013Johnnie Weathersby III, Senior BI Data Analyst\\\\/Architect here at The Motley FoolPros:Won our award for Best Online Savings AccountCompetitive APYNo maintenance feesFDIC insured up to $250,000Cons:Slightly higher APY is available elsewhere, though those accounts may have less rate stabilityNo ATM card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nWhy should you use a high interest savings account?\\\\n\\\\nSwitching to one of our best savings accounts could earn you a 10x higher interest rate on your cash: all of our best online savings accounts here pay 4.00% APY or more, while the average U.S. savings account pays a paltry 0.40% APY, per the FDIC. And your money is safe since all the accounts here are FDIC insured up to at least $250,000.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow we picked the best high-yield savings accountsWe used a comprehensive process for reviewing and researching the top saving accounts, which added up to well over 100 hours of our experts\\\\u2019 time. There are obvious things we look for first: these accounts need to have a high APY, be FDIC insured, have low or no fees, low account minimums, and a strong brand reputation. We also read the fine print to make sure things like transfer and withdrawal limits are acceptable -- after all, what good is a high yield savings account if you can\\'t get your money out when you need it?Additionally, we personally use most of the accounts recommended here so we are deeply familiar with the ins-and-outs of them, and feel as comfortable recommending them to you as we do our friends and family.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSee more about how we rate the best high yield savings accounts by expanding this section.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen you\\'re looking for a high-interest savings account, the account\\'s APY isn\\'t the only factor to consider. Keep the items listed below in mind when you compare savings accounts to avoid surprises down the road.FDIC insurance: Most banks offer FDIC insurance. It\\'s unlikely you\\'ll ever use it, but it\\'s risky not to have it. If your bank fails and your funds aren\\'t insured, you lose your money. That\\'s why we think the best savings accounts are ones with FDIC insurance.High APY: APYs fluctuate from bank to bank and over time, so there\\'s no solid definition of a high APY. You don\\'t need the highest rate on the market, but you should choose one that\\'s close to the highest around. This will earn you more interest.Low fees: Fees can eat into your profits and possibly cost you more than you\\'re earning in interest. Check your bank\\'s fee schedule to learn about any costs associated with the account, and avoid a monthly maintenance fee if you can. Also, check to see if there\\'s a minimum balance requirement on the account. The best savings account for you might have a few fees -- but, in an ideal world, you can meet whatever is required to waive those fees.Accessibility: Make sure you\\'re comfortable with the ways you can deposit money into your savings account and withdraw it when necessary. You likely also want a bank with an online portal and mobile banking so you can manage your funds remotely. The best bank to open a savings account at is one you\\'re comfortable interacting with, whether that\\'s online, in-person, over the phone, or at an ATM.Welcome Offers: Some bank accounts also offer bonuses. If you\\'re looking for a high-yield savings account with a bonus, check out our list of Best Bank Bonuses to see our top picks.And remember -- choosing a bank is personal. You\\'re the one who ultimately knows which account is the best savings account for your needs, preferences, and lifestyle!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhy you can trust usHere at The Motley Fool, we\\\\u2019ve been helping people grow their wealth since 1993.

You can open one with most banks and credit unions, but always compare interest rates between banks before you open an account.If you\\'re not sure where to start looking for an online savings account, check our list above to find out which banks we believe offer the best online savings accounts.Our industry banking experts have weighed in below for how they\\\\u2019d personally recommend leveraging and choosing the right savings account for you!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to open a savings account online or in person\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo open a savings account, fill out an online application form or visit a branch (if your chosen bank has them).Requirements to open a savings accountThis process should be similar whether you open a savings account online or at a brick-and-mortar bank. You will need to provide some personal information, including:Your addressYour Social Security numberA government-issued ID, like a driver\\'s license or a passportIf you are opening a joint savings account, both parties will need to provide this information.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nMinimum deposit to open account\\\\n\\\\nYour bank may also require a minimum deposit to open the account. The minimum deposit may be different from the ongoing minimum balance required to avoid monthly maintenance fees. If you\\'re making this minimum deposit by transferring funds from another bank account, you\\'ll need to know its routing and account number.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat to know about savings accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith a savings account, your bank pays you interest on your money -- usually every month. How much interest you earn is determined by the account\\'s annual percentage yield (APY). You\\'ll earn more interest with an account that has a high APY.The best online savings accounts offer both convenience and high interest rates. A larger balance or a higher savings account interest rate results in more interest.It\\'s always good to compare savings account interest rates before opening an account. The best savings account interest rates can add a nice bump in your funds without much effort on your part.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much money should you keep in a savings account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA savings account is a great place to keep your emergency fund, as well as funds for any short-term savings goals (like a vacation or a down payment on a home).Here\\'s what the experts we spoke with had to say about how much you should have in savings:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPeople should generally keep a collective balance in their checking and savings accounts equal to three to six months\\' worth of living expenses.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Jeff Jones, PhD, CFA\\\\u00ae, CFP\\\\u00ae, CPA (Inactive), Department Head, Finance and General Business Department\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nif you drive an old car, or know that your roof is getting up there in age, or work in a job with a lot of volatility in hours or susceptibility to layoff, then you\\'ll need more emergency savings.\\\\n\\\\nMatthew S.

Often, banks limit the number of free withdrawals you can make in a month.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare types of savings accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs you compare savings accounts, think about what you\\'ll use the account for. Do you want to be able to withdraw your money at any time to cover unexpected expenses? Are you saving up for a major goal over several years, and could use every dollar of interest you can earn? Answering these questions will help you compare savings accounts and decide which is best for your needs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s a look at the common types of savings accounts you\\'ll run into.Traditional savings account: These accounts are usually easy to open and easy to access. But APYs tend to be pretty low, and most of these accounts carry maintenance fees if your balance falls below a certain amount.High-yield savings account: These are similar to traditional savings accounts, but they offer much higher APYs and most don\\'t have monthly maintenance fees.Money market account: Money market accounts offer the APYs of a savings account with the easier access of a checking account. However, these accounts usually have higher minimum balance requirements than typical savings accounts.Certificate of deposit (CD) account: Certificates of deposit (CDs) usually offer some higher APYs than any of the savings accounts discussed above. If you\\'re looking for the best APY on a savings account, CDs are definitely worth considering. But you have to agree not to withdraw your funds for the full CD term (which could be months or years).Specialty savings account: A specialty savings account is a savings account that\\'s geared at a certain group of people or goals. Examples include kids\\' savings accounts, health saving accounts, and education savings accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about savings account interest rates\\\\n\\\\nIs a high-yield savings account worth it? What is a good interest rate, anyway? And how do you compare savings account rates?If you\\'re asking these questions, you\\'re not alone. Here are some FAQs we\\'ve answered about savings account interest rates:How do you calculate the interest you\\'ll earn on a savings account?What is a good interest rate for a savings account?What is the interest rate on my current savings account?Why are interest rates so low on savings accounts?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnline vs. traditional banksIf you don\\'t want to open a savings account online, don\\'t worry -- you can get a high interest savings account at a brick-and-mortar bank too. You might just need to look around a little more, since high interest savings accounts are more rare at brick-and-mortar institutions.Savings accounts at online banks are slightly different from savings accounts at traditional banks. Here are some of the key differences between savings accounts at online and brick-and-mortar banks:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nService\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBrick-and-mortar banks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnline banks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInterest rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenerally low\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenerally high\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHours of operation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFixed to the bank\\'s schedule\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlexible to your schedule\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nATM networks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExtensive ATM networks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCoverage varies\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCustomer service\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn-person service in addition to call centers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCall centers often extended or 24\\\\/7 hours\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAccount access\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBranch withdrawals, transfers, and ATMs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTransfers and ATMs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFDIC insured\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUsually\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSavings Account TerminologyHere are a few key terms to know before you open a savings account. These are important terms for online savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, and high-yield savings accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAPY: This stands for \\\\\"annual percentage yield.\\\\\" People often use this term interchangeably with interest rate, but the two aren\\'t the same. APY takes into account the actual interest rate as well as how often that interest compounds. A higher APY means more interest for you.When we say \\\\\"compare savings account rates,\\\\\" we mean \\\\\"compare APYs.\\\\\"Monthly maintenance fee: This is a fee your bank charges to maintain your savings account. Some banks, especially online banks, don\\'t charge this fee, and others will waive it if you meet certain requirements.Liquidity: Liquidity refers to how easy it is to turn your money into cash. Highly liquid accounts make this simple, while low-liquidity accounts make it a lot more challenging to get cash when you need it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuidance from Savings Account Experts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMatthew S. Rutledge\\\\n\\\\nAssociate Professor of the Practice, Boston College Economics Department\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDr. Jeff Jones\\\\n\\\\nJeffrey S. Jones, PhD, CFA\\\\u00ae, CFP\\\\u00ae, CPA (Inactive), Department Head, Finance and General Business Department\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a high-yield savings account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA high-yield savings account is a savings account that offers a much higher APY than average. Some high-yield savings accounts offer APYs that are 10-times the national average or more. This means your savings can grow more quickly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a savings account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA savings account is a type of bank account designed for money you don\\\\u2019t plan to spend immediately. You can open one of these with any bank or credit union, and you can usually deposit as much as you\\\\u2019d like to the account. You deposit money in-person, or through direct deposit, electronic transfer, check, or some other method.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs my money safe in a savings account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes. Savings account funds are FDIC insured up to $250,000 per person per bank, so there\\'s no risk of losing money if your bank goes under. The risk of losing money with a savings account is pretty slim. It could be possible if you incur a lot of fees, your identity is stolen, or a hacker gains access to your bank account.As long as you are aware of the fees your bank charges (and ways to avoid them) and you protect your personal and account information, your savings account should only make you money.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do savings accounts work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSavings accounts earn interest over time on money you don\\'t plan to spend immediately. How much interest you earn depends on the balance in your savings account and the interest rate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat does the bank do with my savings account money?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBanks use your savings to fund loans for their customers. Borrowers then pay interest on the loan, and your bank sends some of that interest to your savings account.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat should I look for in a savings account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe best savings accounts have:High APY: The top savings accounts should include a high APY in range with our picks.No monthly maintenance fee: Most of the best savings accounts won\\'t charge a monthly maintenance fee.FDIC insurance: Whether you\\'re putting money aside to build an emergency fund or wanting to earn more interest, security is important.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much interest will $1,000 make in a year?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA $1,000 deposit could earn about $35 in interest in a year, if you put it in a high-yield savings account with a 3.50% APY. The amount of interest your money earns depends on the bank account and its APY. In a brick-and-mortar savings account with a 0.30% APY, a $1,000 deposit would only earn about $3.Savings rates can -- and do -- go up and down. These changes will affect the amount of interest you earn.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat kind of deposit account earns the most interest?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThese types of accounts often earn more than traditional savings accounts:High-yield savings accountCertificate of deposit accountMoney market accountEven among these types of accounts, you will find a wide range of interest rates offered. Generally, the highest interest rates are found at credit unions and online-only banks.Some banks and credit unions offer tiered interest rates. For example, you might earn a relatively high rate on your first $1,000, and then a smaller rate on the amount above that. Or your bank might pay a modest rate on the first $25,000 and a higher rate on the amount above that. Beginner savers will definitely do better with the first type of account. Once you start building your savings, you can use an online savings calculator to figure out where you\\'ll earn more.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan you keep an emergency fund in a savings account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes, a savings account (especially a high-yield savings account) is a great place for your emergency savings. Here\\'s why:Your emergency fund should be easily accessible to you. Keep your emergency savings in an account that allows you to transfer or withdraw money quickly. A certificate of deposit account is not recommended because no one can predict when financial emergencies are going to happen, and you might have to pay a penalty if you withdraw money from a CD before the maturity date.Your emergency fund should be protected from losses. It\\'s generally not advisable to put your emergency fund in the stock market or other account that could experience fluctuations, because you wouldn\\'t want the value to be in a dip when you have a financial emergency.Your emergency fund should grow. This is why you shouldn\\'t keep your money under the mattress, even if you feel that it would be safe from theft. A high-yield savings account allows you to maximize your earnings. Stashing cash -- or leaving your money in a traditional savings account -- means you forego the opportunity to earn as much as possible in interest.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Brendan Byrnes\\\\n and\\\\u00a0Kailey Hagen\\\\nOur Banking Experts\",\"Article Date\":\"October 2, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best Checking Accounts of October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/banks\\\\/checking-accounts\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Even better, no fee checking accounts are becoming more and more common.Most checking accounts today make it easy to access your money, offer flexible withdrawal options, and are FDIC insured. And the best checking accounts have low or no fees, a high APY (so your money is making money), and ATM reimbursement. Ready to compare checking accounts? We\\'ve scoured the banking world to find the accounts below -- our picks for the best checking accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest checking accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur quick picks\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re short on time, here are the two top checking accounts we highly recommend.Both of these checking accounts earn interest.

A higher APY means more interest.ATM reimbursement: Some of the best online checking accounts reimburse ATM fees charged by other banks.Convenient ATM or branch locations: Your local bank on the corner is convenient, but it\\'s not the only option. Some online banks have massive ATM networks and easy methods to make deposits, even with cash.When you compare checking accounts, look at all of the above factors to get the whole picture for each account.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA note from our head of product ratings, Brian Frey\\\\n\\\\nThe checking accounts we rank highly all meet these standards:Issued by well-respected financial institutionsBoast competitive APYs or cash back rewardsOffer the ability to add on a savings accountThese features are critical to a positive checking experience.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKeep reading to see the checking accounts we recommend (and why we think they\\'re the bees\\' knees):\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare the best checking accounts:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow The List [+]\\\\nHide The List [-]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.50% APY:\\\\n\\\\nSofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nup to 3.30% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAxos Bank Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% APY:\\\\n\\\\nDiscover Cashback Debit\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nup to 1.10% APY:\\\\n\\\\nQuontic High Interest Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1.00% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Express Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% APY:\\\\n\\\\nBetterment Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUp to 0.25% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAlly Spending Account\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.25% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAlliant High Rate Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.45% APY:\\\\n\\\\nSchwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.10% APY:\\\\n\\\\nCapital One 360 Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.25% APY:\\\\n\\\\nEverBank Yield Pledge\\\\u00ae Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUp to 0.15% APY:\\\\n\\\\nLendingClub Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow Best Offers Available in\\\\n\\\\nAll States & Territories\\\\n-----States------\\\\n\\\\nAlabama\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArizona\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArkansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nColorado\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConnecticut\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington DC\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelaware\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlorida\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeorgia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHawaii\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdaho\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIllinois\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIowa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKentucky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLouisiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaine\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaryland\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMassachusetts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichigan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMinnesota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMissouri\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMontana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNebraska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNevada\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Jersey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mexico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOhio\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOregon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPennsylvania\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRhode Island\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTennessee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTexas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUtah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVermont\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVirginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWest Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWisconsin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyoming\\\\n\\\\n-----Territories------\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Samoa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFederated States of Micronesia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuam\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarshall Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Mariana Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPuerto Rico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPalau\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Virgin Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as\\\\nof Sep 28, 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOffer\\\\nAPY\\\\nMinimum to Earn APY\\\\nNext Steps\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.75 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Savings accounts tend to earn more interest, which make them perfect for saving money over long periods of time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSavings accounts typically have higher APYs, which makes them a better choice for an emergency fund or other cash you don\\'t anticipate using anytime soon but don\\'t feel comfortable investing. But savings accounts also have restrictions that limit the number of withdrawals you can make per month and the ease of access you have to your money.Checking accounts are intended to be spending accounts used for everyday purchases. They have fewer limitations on the number of payments or withdrawals you can make each month. But they usually don\\'t have a high APY like savings accounts do, even if they are high interest.For more on the difference, be sure to check out our beginner\\'s guide to banking.RELATED: How to Open a Checking Account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre checking accounts free?Yes and no. When people talk about free checking accounts, they are usually referencing checking accounts that don\\'t charge a monthly maintenance fee. Most accounts still charge other fees, though.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEven if you aren\\'t charged a monthly maintenance fee, you could be hit with other fees. So not all \\\\\"free checking accounts\\\\\" are actually free. Here are some of the more common fees you might see:Monthly maintenance fee (also known as the service charge, among other names): This is the most common recurring checking account charge. It often ranges from $5 to $15, but can vary widely. Fortunately, banks often waive this charge if a customer meets certain standards. These can include a minimum number of transactions on the account\\'s debit card, setting up recurring direct deposits from an employer, or meeting a minimum ongoing balance amount.Overdraft fee: This classic charge has been a staple of the checking account for many years. Should you spend more money than what you\\'ve got in the account, you\\'ll be hit with an overdraft fee. $30 per incident is roughly the going rate. Banks don\\'t typically waive overdraft fees, though some online checking accounts don\\'t charge them.ATM fee: Banks like to charge ATM fees if you draw funds from cash machines that aren\\'t theirs. A standard hit is $2 or $3 per transaction, but these can be much higher in certain locations, especially abroad. The ATM owner may charge their own fees as well.To be clear, not all checking accounts (especially online checking accounts) charge all of these fees. For example, many of our picks for best high-interest checking accounts don\\'t have any monthly maintenance fees or overdraft fees, and some even go so far as to reimburse customers for ATM fees charged by other banks.So the best checking accounts with no fees are the checking accounts with no fees you will incur. That said, if you can find a no fee checking account (as in, you can avoid any fees the bank charges, such as overdraft fees) you can save a lot of money. If you\\'re looking for a free checking account, make sure to keep an eye on all the possible charges -- not just monthly maintenance.RELATED: Best Free Checking Accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDo checking accounts earn interest?The best checking account offers include at least a low APY, but they can be hard to find. Most banks don\\'t offer interest on their checking accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis is particularly true of banks with brick-and-mortar operations. Keeping branches open is expensive and resource-draining, and the prevalence of checking accounts make them a prime target for cost cutting.There are, however, exceptions to this no-interest standard. Interest-bearing checking accounts exist.Unfortunately, these accounts often have relatively high opening and\\\\/or minimum ongoing balance requirements. The effort it takes to hit those marks, plus the funds they tie down, are not worthwhile for many customers, especially because many of the best interest-bearing checking accounts only offer a low APY.You can sometimes find better APYs if you open a checking account online. Online-only banks have more wiggle room to pay interest since they don\\'t bear those brick-and-mortar costs. It\\'s not unusual to see interest-bearing online checking accounts. Even with the best online checking account, interest rates are generally much lower than what you\\'ll find with online savings accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur reviews: Best Checking Accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow Best Offers Available in\\\\n\\\\nAll States & Territories\\\\n-----States------\\\\n\\\\nAlabama\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArizona\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArkansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nColorado\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConnecticut\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington DC\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelaware\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlorida\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeorgia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHawaii\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdaho\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIllinois\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIowa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKentucky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLouisiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaine\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaryland\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMassachusetts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichigan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMinnesota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMissouri\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMontana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNebraska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNevada\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Jersey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mexico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOhio\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOregon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPennsylvania\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRhode Island\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTennessee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTexas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUtah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVermont\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVirginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWest Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWisconsin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyoming\\\\n\\\\n-----Territories------\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Samoa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFederated States of Micronesia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuam\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarshall Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Mariana Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPuerto Rico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPalau\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Virgin Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRatings Methodology\\\\nRates as\\\\nof Sep 28, 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.75 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

However, the account is one of the best online checking accounts in the industry, with no account fees whatsoever, a competitive APY, and as much as $2 million in FDIC insurance for people with high-balance accounts.One of the biggest benefits of having a combo account is being able to seamlessly transfer money between the checking and savings account, and the latter offers up to 4.50%. There are some unique benefits such as free checks, and SoFi typically offers excellent welcome bonuses, as well as some of the best referral bonuses in the business. Account owners also get free ATM access at over 55,000 ATMs in the Allpoint Network, as well as access to their direct deposits up to two days early.Of course, the account isn\\'t perfect. Not everyone wants both a checking and savings account, and some competitors don\\'t require any special activities (like direct deposit) to take advantage of the best interest rates.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Competitive APY on checking balancesNo feesATM access at more than 55,000 locationsFree checksExcellent welcome and referral bonuses\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:No standalone checking accountDirect deposit is required for top interest rates as well as overdraft protection\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead our SoFi Checking and Savings review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow Best Offers Available in\\\\n\\\\nAll States & Territories\\\\n-----States------\\\\n\\\\nAlabama\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArizona\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArkansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nColorado\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConnecticut\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington DC\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelaware\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlorida\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeorgia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHawaii\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdaho\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIllinois\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIowa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKentucky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLouisiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaine\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaryland\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMassachusetts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichigan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMinnesota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMissouri\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMontana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNebraska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNevada\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Jersey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mexico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOhio\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOregon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPennsylvania\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRhode Island\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTennessee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTexas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUtah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVermont\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVirginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWest Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWisconsin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyoming\\\\n\\\\n-----Territories------\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Samoa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFederated States of Micronesia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuam\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarshall Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Mariana Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPuerto Rico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPalau\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Virgin Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as\\\\nof Sep 28, 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n 2023 Award Winner\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAxos Bank Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Axos Bank Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.25 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

It offers one of the best APYs we\\'ve seen in a checking account, with the top yield of up to 3.30% even rivaling some online savings accounts. It has no monthly maintenance or overdraft fees. One of the most unique features of the Axos Bank Rewards Checking account is unlimited ATM fee reimbursements, which can be an extremely valuable benefit. For example, have you ever been in a situation, such as at a concert, where ATM fees were outrageously high? Axos has you covered.It\\'s important to clarify that there are certain conditions that need to be met to get the highest possible APY. To get the maximum yield, you\\'ll need to:Receive $1,500 or more per month in direct depositsUse your account\\'s debit card for at least 10 transactions per monthMaintain an Axos Managed Portfolios (robo-advisor) account with at least $2,500Maintain an Axos Self-Directed Trading Account with average balance of $2,500 or moreAnd use your Axos Bank Rewards Checking account to pay an Axos consumer loan.Obviously, not all customers will do all of those things.

With cash back on every purchase, it\\'s possible to earn even more than you could with a typical checking account APY without changing your habits at all. The fact that Discover has done away with many common checking account fees only adds to its appeal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead Full Review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover Cashback DebitBest for: Customers who don\\'t always keep high balances but use their debit cards often.The Discover Cashback Debit account can be a great checking account alternative that offers especially good value for customers who use their debit cards to make purchases often.The account offers 1% cash back on debit card purchases, which is among the best debit card reward rates of any checking account (or checking alternative) on our radar. However, there\\'s a limit -- only purchases up to $3,000 per month earn rewards, so this effectively sets a $360 annual cash back limit. The account has no monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, stop payment fees, or nonsufficient funds (NSF) fees. And the account offers the ability for customers with direct deposit to get their paychecks up to two days early.Discover Cashback Debit customers have access to more than 60,000 fee-free ATMs, and there is no minimum balance or account activity requirement. And one particularly unique perk is that Discover provides your checks absolutely free.One of the biggest drawbacks is that the Discover Cashback Debit account doesn\\'t pay interest. However, the debit card spending rewards can certainly make up for the APYs offered by competing checking accounts, especially if you use your debit card often. If you regularly need access to your cash, Discover limits ATM withdrawals to $510 per day.The Discover Cashback Debit account is FDIC insured up to $250,000 per depositor and can be a great checking alternative for customers who generally don\\'t maintain a high enough balance for interest to make much of a difference, but who use their debit cards regularly to make purchases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Debit card cash back rewardsNo monthly feesNo overdraft or NSF feesAccess to over 60,000 ATMs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:Monthly cap on cash back rewardsDoesn\\'t pay interestNo banking branches\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead our Discover Cashback Debit review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow Best Offers Available in\\\\n\\\\nAll States & Territories\\\\n-----States------\\\\n\\\\nAlabama\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArizona\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArkansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nColorado\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConnecticut\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington DC\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelaware\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlorida\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeorgia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHawaii\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdaho\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIllinois\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIowa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKentucky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLouisiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaine\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaryland\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMassachusetts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichigan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMinnesota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMissouri\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMontana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNebraska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNevada\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Jersey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mexico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOhio\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOregon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPennsylvania\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRhode Island\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTennessee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTexas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUtah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVermont\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVirginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWest Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWisconsin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyoming\\\\n\\\\n-----Territories------\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Samoa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFederated States of Micronesia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuam\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarshall Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Mariana Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPuerto Rico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPalau\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Virgin Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as\\\\nof Sep 28, 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQuontic High Interest Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Quontic High Interest Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.00 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

But it is also a fully functional FDIC-insured bank, and offers a range of consumer deposit accounts, loan products, and more. This includes the American Express Rewards Checking account, which can be an excellent choice for people who want an online checking account that pays interest on their money.It isn\\'t too common for checking accounts to pay interest, even for online checking accounts, but the American Express Rewards Checking account does. To be sure, its APY isn\\'t competitive with what you\\'ll find through online savings accounts and CDs, but it can allow you to earn some money on the cash in your checking account.One of the most unique features is the debit card rewards program. Checking account customers earn 1 Amex Membership Reward point for every $2 in eligible purchases, with no maximum reward amount. Like most online checking accounts, there is no monthly maintenance fee and no minimum balance requirement. While Amex doesn\\'t have branches or its own ATMs, customers have access to their money through 37,000 MoneyPass ATM locations throughout the United States.One way American Express stands out over other online checking accounts is its customer service. American Express offers account holders 24\\\\/7 customer service over the phone or live chat. And with American Express\\' highly rated mobile app, it could be a smart choice for people who like to manage their finances on the go, especially those who already have a credit card relationship with Amex.There are a few potential drawbacks, however. The American Express Rewards Checking account is only offered to Amex\\'s U.S. Card Members who have been customers for at least three months. And there are some services Amex doesn\\'t offer, such as outgoing wire transfers or online bill payment, so it might not be the best choice if you regularly use these things.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Interest-bearing with competitive APYDebit card rewardsNo monthly feesNo minimum balanceGreat customer service\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:Available for Amex Card Members onlyNo physical branches\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead our American Express Rewards Checking review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow Best Offers Available in\\\\n\\\\nAll States & Territories\\\\n-----States------\\\\n\\\\nAlabama\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArizona\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArkansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nColorado\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConnecticut\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington DC\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelaware\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlorida\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeorgia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHawaii\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdaho\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIllinois\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIowa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKentucky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLouisiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaine\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaryland\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMassachusetts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichigan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMinnesota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMissouri\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMontana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNebraska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNevada\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Jersey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mexico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOhio\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOregon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPennsylvania\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRhode Island\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTennessee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTexas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUtah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVermont\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVirginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWest Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWisconsin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyoming\\\\n\\\\n-----Territories------\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Samoa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFederated States of Micronesia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuam\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarshall Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Mariana Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPuerto Rico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPalau\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Virgin Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as\\\\nof Sep 28, 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBetterment Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead Review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 3.50 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

To qualify for the account, you\\'ll need to join the Alliant Credit Union, but if you\\'re willing to take that step, this is a solid online checking account.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:No minimum balance to get the highest APYOver 80,000 in-network ATMs nationwide$20 in monthly ATM fee reimbursements for out-of-network ATMsNo monthly maintenance or overdraft fees\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:Some other online checking accounts offer higher APYMust enroll in e-statements and use direct deposit for interestMust join Alliant\\'s credit union\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead our Alliant High Rate Checking review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpen Account  for Sofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow Best Offers Available in\\\\n\\\\nAll States & Territories\\\\n-----States------\\\\n\\\\nAlabama\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArizona\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArkansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nColorado\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConnecticut\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington DC\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelaware\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlorida\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeorgia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHawaii\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdaho\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIllinois\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIowa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKentucky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLouisiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaine\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaryland\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMassachusetts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichigan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMinnesota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMissouri\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMontana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNebraska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNevada\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Jersey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mexico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOhio\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOregon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPennsylvania\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRhode Island\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTennessee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTexas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUtah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVermont\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVirginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWest Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWisconsin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyoming\\\\n\\\\n-----Territories------\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Samoa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFederated States of Micronesia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuam\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarshall Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Mariana Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPuerto Rico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPalau\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Virgin Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as\\\\nof Sep 28, 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n 2023 Award Winner\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSchwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead Review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.75 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Here are the basic questions you should ask to compare checking accounts:What checking account features do you need?Do you want a debit card? Overdraft protection? Mobile banking?How much will your checking account balance be?Many checking accounts have maintenance fees, but these fees can be waived if you keep a certain amount of money in the account.What are the most convenient banks for you?Is there a bank near your grocery store? Is there a bank with a top-rated mobile app?What checking account fees do those banks charge?You can usually find the bank\\'s fee schedule online, or you can ask for it in-person at a branch.What checking account bonus offers are available to you?Some banks offer sign-up bonuses to new customers who fulfill certain requirements.Identifying the best bank for a checking account can be tricky, but it\\'ll make a major impact on your overall experience. If you\\'re opening an account with someone else, make sure the account works for them, too. The best joint checking accounts will make life easier -- for both account holders.If you can\\'t decide between two similar checking accounts, look for extras that make one stand out. For example, some banks offer cash back on debit card purchases or out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements. Also consider what\\'s convenient for you when choosing the best bank for a checking account: Is there a branch or ATM near your home? And remember: The best checking account offers for you might be different from the best checking account offers for your neighbor. Think about your lifestyle before deciding which account has the best bonus for your money.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTypes of checking accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s a look at some of the most common types of checking accounts.There\\'s a lot of different types, but most of the differences come down to the perks each account offers. To find the best checking account offers for you, ask yourself what you\\'ll need from your checking account. Do you want to earn interest? Avoid maintenance fees? Get a checking account bonus when you sign up? The answers to these questions will help you compare checking accounts and find the one that fits your lifestyle.Traditional checking accountTraditional checking accounts are available through most banks and credit unions. They usually don\\\\u2019t earn interest, and some charge monthly maintenance fees if your balance is too low. But it\\'s usually pretty easy to access your funds. Most give you check-writing capabilities and a debit card so you can directly withdraw your funds when you need them. And if you choose a brick-and-mortar bank, you\\'ll be able to get money at any bank branch as well.Premium checking accountPremium checking accounts offer special perks, like lower fees or monthly out-of-network ATM fee reimbursements. But these are usually only available to customers who open multiple accounts with the same bank. Brick-and-mortar banks offer these as a way of competing with the fee-free checking accounts offered by online banks.Student checking accountStudent checking accounts are geared at college students, usually up to age 25. Most of the time, these accounts don\\'t have monthly maintenance fees and they allow for online and mobile banking just like traditional checking accounts.RELATED: Best Student Checking AccountsSenior checking accountSenior checking accounts are targeted to adults who are 62 or older in most cases. These accounts may have lower monthly maintenance fees or they may not charge a monthly fee at all for account ownership. Their features are usually pretty similar to traditional checking accounts.Interest-bearing checking accountInterest-bearing checking accounts enable you to earn a modest annual percentage yield (APY) on your checking account funds. Rates are usually lower than what you typically see with high-yield savings accounts, and you may need to maintain a high minimum balance to qualify for interest. The best high-yield checking accounts are often online, because online banks don\\'t have as many overhead costs to cover as brick-and-mortar banks.Business checking accountBusiness checking accounts are designed for companies rather than individuals. There are often several options business owners can choose from, depending on the features they need and the number of monthly transactions they make.Checkless checking accountCheckless checking accounts are traditional checking accounts that don\\\\u2019t offer check-writing capabilities. Banks sometimes offer these as a fee-free or low-cost alternative to traditional checking accounts. One of these might suit you as long as you\\'re comfortable paying for items a different way.Rewards checking accountRewards checking accounts offer special perks, like cash back on debit card purchases. This is more common with online banks. It may not appeal to everyone, but if you use your debit card often, you might earn more money this way than you would with a traditional interest-bearing checking account.Private bank checkingPrivate bank checking accounts are reserved for the ultra-wealthy. These customers usually have large balances, and banks give them dedicated representatives to assist them with their needs.Second chance checkingSecond chance checking accounts are for individuals who have previously had their bank accounts closed, usually due to a failure to pay fees or because they were using their accounts to commit fraud. This makes banks reluctant to work with them again. These second chance accounts usually have more stringent application requirements and there\\'s often a monthly fee you can\\'t waive.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhy should you have a checking account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMost American adults have checking accounts, and there\\'s a good reason why it\\'s such a popular place to keep money.Here are a few reasons to open a checking account, whether it be a high-interest online checking account or one from a traditional brick-and-mortar bank:Easy spending: If you have an emergency expense, an unexpected bill, or even just a fun shopping spree -- it\\'s easy to spend money out of a checking account. Some options for spending out of a checking account include checks, debit cards, online banking, and mobile wallets. Checking accounts are also great for combining finances. The best joint checking accounts allow you to pay shared bills, like rent or insurance, with ease.(Usually) no restrictions: Believe it or not, most other bank account types have restrictions on spending. With a savings account, you can usually only make six withdrawals each month. And with a certificate of deposit (CD), you can\\'t take money out at all without paying a penalty (unless your CD has matured -- but waiting for it to mature can take months).Protection: Most checking accounts have insurance covering up to $250,000 in deposits. Banks have FDIC insurance, and credit unions have NCUA insurance, with each offering coverage up to the same amount. In the unlikely event that your bank shuts down, insurance would cover it. Also, consumer fraud protection services are standard and free of charge in many checking accounts, both nationwide and at local banks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a checking account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA checking account is a bank account designed for spending. Most checking accounts come with a debit card. Account holders can also take advantage of online bill pay services.It contrasts with a savings account, which is intended for -- yes -- saving. Savings accounts usually don\\'t have debit cards, because banks don\\'t expect you to spend the money in your savings account.You can open a checking account for yourself, or you can open a checking account with someone else. An account with more than one account holder is called a joint checking account. If you\\'re searching for the best joint checking account, you\\'ll need to take into consideration both you and the other prospective account holder\\'s needs, habits, and lifestyles.You can open a checking account online or in-person, through both traditional brick-and-mortar banks and an increasing number of online financial institutions (like that new banking app your coworker won\\'t stop raving about).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nHow many checking accounts should I have?\\\\n\\\\nMost people have just one or two checking accounts, but like many personal finance categories, it depends on you. In addition to a standard individual checking account, many couples have joint checking accounts, and many business owners also have business checking accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKey checking account terms to know\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s some important checking account terminology you should be familiar with:Debit card: A debit card is a payment card that\\'s linked to a checking or savings account. It\\'s usually (but not always) Visa- or Mastercard-branded. Unlike a credit card, which allows you to borrow money and pay it back later, debit card transactions are approved based on the current balance of your account, and the money is immediately deducted.PIN: Short for \\\\\"personal identification number,\\\\\" a PIN is a number that\\'s typically four to six digits. It\\'s used to identify you when using your debit card for ATM withdrawals or in-store purchases.Insufficient funds: If you write a check or attempt to spend more money than you have in your checking account, the transaction may be rejected for insufficient funds.Overdraft: An overdraft is the result of a transaction that causes your account to have a negative balance. The key difference between an overdraft and insufficient funds is that a transaction that results in an overdraft is approved, and a transaction resulting in insufficient funds is rejected. Overdrafts usually carry fees.Mobile or remote deposit: Most checking accounts allow customers to make check deposits from their smartphone or other mobile device by uploading a photo of the check, thereby saving a trip to the bank.Endorsement: To endorse a check means to sign the back of a check in the specified area, indicating that the person being paid is accepting the money.Routing number: There are three important numbers on every check, and the first is the routing number. This is a nine-digit code that corresponds with the bank that holds the checking account. Some major banks have several different routing numbers, depending on the geographical location where the account was opened.Account number: The account number identifies the specific deposit account within the bank indicated by the routing number. In order to send money to a checking account, you\\'ll need both the routing and account number. In short, the routing number tells the sending institution which bank to send the money to, and the account number tells that bank where to put it.Check number: Although it\\'s not particularly important when it comes to most transactions, every check has a unique number (usually three or four digits). Check numbers are useful for helping the account holder keep track of payments they make by check and can also help identify fraud in many cases.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest Checking Account Interest Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow The List [+]\\\\nHide The List [-]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.50% APY:\\\\n\\\\nSofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nup to 3.30% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAxos Bank Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% APY:\\\\n\\\\nDiscover Cashback Debit\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nup to 1.10% APY:\\\\n\\\\nQuontic High Interest Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1.00% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Express Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0% APY:\\\\n\\\\nBetterment Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUp to 0.25% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAlly Spending Account\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.25% APY:\\\\n\\\\nAlliant High Rate Checking\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.45% APY:\\\\n\\\\nSchwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.10% APY:\\\\n\\\\nCapital One 360 Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0.25% APY:\\\\n\\\\nEverBank Yield Pledge\\\\u00ae Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUp to 0.15% APY:\\\\n\\\\nLendingClub Rewards Checking\\\\n\\\\n(Member FDIC.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow Best Offers Available in\\\\n\\\\nAll States & Territories\\\\n-----States------\\\\n\\\\nAlabama\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlaska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArizona\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nArkansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nColorado\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConnecticut\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington DC\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDelaware\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFlorida\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGeorgia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHawaii\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIdaho\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIllinois\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIndiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIowa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKansas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKentucky\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLouisiana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaine\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaryland\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMassachusetts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichigan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMinnesota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMississippi\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMissouri\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMontana\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNebraska\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNevada\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Hampshire\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Jersey\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew Mexico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNew York\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOhio\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOklahoma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOregon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPennsylvania\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRhode Island\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Carolina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSouth Dakota\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTennessee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTexas\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUtah\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVermont\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVirginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWashington\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWest Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWisconsin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWyoming\\\\n\\\\n-----Territories------\\\\n\\\\nAmerican Samoa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFederated States of Micronesia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGuam\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMarshall Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNorthern Mariana Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPuerto Rico\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPalau\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Virgin Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. Minor Outlying Islands\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRatings Methodology\\\\nRates as\\\\nof Sep 28, 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOffer\\\\nAPY\\\\nMinimum to Earn APY\\\\nNext Steps\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSofi Checking and Savings\\\\n\\\\nMember FDIC.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.75 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Checking accounts typically have no limits on the number of withdrawals or payments the owner can make, unlike savings accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre online checking accounts safe?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWell-established online banks are just as secure as traditional banks. They\\'re FDIC insured as well, and they follow the same regulatory laws as any other bank. Not only are they required to put numerous security measures in place to protect your information, but they\\'re also required to limit your liability as a consumer in cases of fraud.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre checking accounts free?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChecking account costs vary dramatically. Some have multiple fees, such as maintenance charges, overdraft fees, and ATM fees, while others are entirely fee free.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDo checking accounts earn interest?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSome checking accounts, especially those offered by online banks, earn interest on deposits.

Here are some of the things to keep an eye out for:A high APY: This is how much you\\'ll earn in interest.Daily compounding interest: Want more money in interest? Look for a high yield CD account with daily compounding.Low early withdrawal penalties: You\\'ll pay a penalty to withdraw your funds ahead of schedule. The amount of this penalty should be outlined in a CD\\'s fee schedule.Low or no fees: Fees with high yield CDs aren\\'t common (except for early withdrawal penalties), but it\\'s always good to check.How we decide which CDs to list on this pageYou\\'re probably thinking, \\\\\"Wait a darn minute. How\\'d The Ascent decide which CDs to recommend?\\\\\"We\\'ll tell you: The crew here only lists the CDs we\\'d recommend to family and friends. That means we just post the good stuff \\\\u2013 big banks can\\'t pay their way onto this page! Our litmus test: Would we recommend these CD rates to Grandma at her rock-your-socks-off birthday bonanza? You can bet on it.Follow these tips, and finding the best CD rates today should be a piece of cake.And now you may be hungry for more, so check out what industry experts think about CDs!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTop CD questionsHow do CDs work?A CD is like a savings account, except you\\'re not allowed to withdraw any money for a specific amount of time (anything from a few months to a few years).Are CDs safe?Yes, CDs are one of the safest investments you can make. These accounts are backed by FDIC insurance, so you won\\'t lose money even if your bank goes under. (Note: If you withdraw your money early, you may pay a small fee.)Will CD rates go up in 2023?CD rates will likely continue to go up in 2023, but it\\'s not guaranteed. If there are increases, expect them to be smaller than last year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur Reviews: Best CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLendingClub CD\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nLendingClub CDs don\\'t skimp on interest, offering competitive APYs for all six of their CD terms, from six months to five years. They\\'re also FDIC insured. One downside is that you\\'ll need to commit at least $2,500 to open an account.\\\\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $2,500\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApply Now  for LendingClub CD\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n6 Mo.

LendingClub gives CD owners the ability to withdraw their earned interest at any point without penalty, which could be a big perk for those who want to rely on their CDs for income.One potential negative is LendingClub\\'s $2,500 minimum initial deposit requirement. This can make LendingClub not the best option for beginners or people who want to create a CD ladder with their savings, but it can be an excellent choice for savers with relatively high balances who want to maximize their returns.Upon maturity, LendingClub CDs automatically renew. The bank sends a notice at least 30 days before the maturity date, and once the CD matures, account holders have a 10-day window to decide whether to add or remove money from the CD, or to let it renew for another term.LendingClub is best known for its personal and business loans, but you might be surprised to learn that it owns a banking subsidiary known as LendingClub Bank, which is a fully FDIC-insured financial institution. In addition to its CDs, LendingClub offers high-yield savings and rewards checking accounts. It has a user-friendly mobile banking app, and not only does LendingClub have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, but it has an average customer review of 4.56 out of 5 stars on the platform, one of the highest of any institution in our coverage universe.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Terms from 6 months to 5 yearsVery competitive APYs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:Doesn\\'t offer any non-standard maturity terms$2,500 minimum deposit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWestern Alliance Bank\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nWestern Alliance offers some of the highest APYs we\\\\u2019ve seen across short-term CDs, low $1 minimums, and relatively low withdrawal penalties without any additional fees. But you will need to look elsewhere for terms longer than one year.\\\\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApply Now  for Western Alliance Bank\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3 Mo.

For one thing, the bank offers some of the most competitive APYs we\\'ve seen, especially on shorter-term CDs. In fact, the bank\\'s APYs on 9-month and 1-year CDs are among the best in the industry. Plus, the minimum deposit is just $1, so this can be a very beginner-friendly way to get started in CDs.However, Western Alliance Bank\\'s term lengths are also one of the biggest potential negatives. It only offers four term lengths on Raisin, and its 1-year CD is the longest. You can open a 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, or 1-year CD with an excellent yield through Western Alliance Bank, but if you\\'re looking to lock in a high APY for several years, you\\'ll need to look elsewhere.Another potential negative is that Western Alliance Bank doesn\\'t allow CD owners to withdraw their interest as it is paid. For example, many retired individuals will open a CD and withdraw the monthly interest payments to create an income stream, but this is not allowed with Western Alliance -- money must be left in the account until the maturity date or face a penalty.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Very competitive APYsNo minimum deposit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:Term lengths available online are one year or lessCannot withdraw interest until maturity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQuontic CDs\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nQuontic Bank offers CDs with terms ranging from six months to five years. It offers most of the terms one would expect, though it is missing a four-year CD, so it may not be ideal for those hoping to build a CD ladder. Its rates are competitive, especially on its longer term CDs, and its minimum deposit is more affordable than what you see with some other top\\\\u00a0banks.\\\\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $500\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApply Now  for Quontic CDs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n6 Mo.

It has some of the best CD interest rates in the business, including a 5.30% APY on a 1-year CD, among the highest offered by any of the banks we follow. The bank\\'s CDs have a $500 minimum opening deposit, so be sure to keep that in mind before opening an account.Quontic is an online-focused bank, with just a few branches for its mortgage business, but it is a safe and trustworthy financial institution. It is an FDIC-member bank, so you\\'re covered up to $250,000 per depositor, and the bank has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau after almost 15 years in business.While the $500 minimum deposit might put it out of reach for some beginners, especially those who want to create CD ladders, it is generally a beginner-friendly institution. Quontic offers a beginner-friendly mobile banking app, and live support available by either phone or chat from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET.Finally, Quontic is a great choice for customers who want to keep all of their bank accounts in one place.

It typically doesn\\'t have the highest CD rates in the market, its rates are certainly competitive and it scores high marks in some categories, particularly customer service.Discover offers a wide range of CD term lengths, ranging from six months all the way to 10 years, which is a rarity in the industry. It offers competitive APYs, especially on longer-term CDs. On the downside, Discover has a relatively high $500 minimum deposit to open a new CD, so be sure to keep this in mind when you\\'re shopping around.Discover also offers CDs in IRA (individual retirement account) form, allowing savers to put away money in a tax-advantaged manner. When your Discover CD expires, it will renew automatically, unless you choose to withdraw your funds.As an FDIC-insured bank, Discover\\'s CDs are protected for as much as $250,000 per person in the unlikely event of a bank failure. However, Discover has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and has been in business for over six decades, so it is a very well-established and trusted bank. And although the relatively high minimum deposit might make it less accessible for some savers (not just beginners), Discover has excellent customer service and is available by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Competitive APYsTerms as long as 10 yearsLots of term options -- great for building a CD ladderOffers IRA CDs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:$2,500 minimum deposit to open an account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBarclays Online CD\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nBarclays offers competitive rates on most common CD terms with no minimum balance requirements.

Most of Barclays\\' term lengths offer highly competitive APYs, with its 6-month CD the notable exception. Its longer-term CDs in particular have some of the best APYs on our best CDs list.Barclays primarily made our best CD list because it is one of the most beginner-friendly places to open a CD. Unlike most of its online competitors, Barclays has no minimum deposit requirement, so you can literally open a CD with just a few dollars. This also makes Barclay\\'s one of the few places where you can create a CD ladder with a relatively small amount of money.Interest is paid monthly, and CD owners can choose to have their monthly interest deposited into a Barclays savings account or an account at another institution, or leave it in the account to compound. CDs will renew automatically at the end of the term, which has become the industry\\'s standard practice, and customers have a 14-day grace period to decide to withdraw funds or change the maturity term of the CD.Barclays is one of the oldest continuously operating financial institutions in the world, with roots that trace back to 1690 in London, where the bank\\'s headquarters are still located. It is a stable and trustworthy bank, and although it doesn\\'t have physical branches in the United States, it\\'s important to point out that Barclays is a massive institution in the U.K., and has a size that\\'s on-par with some of the largest U.S. banks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:No minimums to openCompetitive APYs with most term lengths\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:6-month CDs have low APYCDs automatically renew unless the customer closes the account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSynchrony Online CD\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nPerhaps one of the lesser-known names on the list, Synchrony is a full-line bank with a 90-year history.

The bank offers CDs in a wide range of terms from three months to five years and offers two unique products. Synchrony\\'s 11-month no-penalty CD allows account holders to withdraw their money at any time without a penalty, and the 24-month Bump-Up CD allows for a one-time interest rate increase if the bank\\'s APYs rise during the CD\\'s term.There are no minimum deposit requirements, making Synchrony an ideal choice for beginners or for people who want to build a CD ladder without a ton of money. Its no-penalty CD can be a great choice for savers who think they won\\'t need their money soon, but want to maintain flexibility. And the Bump-Up CD is a great choice for people who are worried that interest rates might continue to rise and don\\'t want to miss out on extra income.Synchrony could also be a great choice for people who plan to rely on their CDs for income. Many banks don\\'t allow any withdrawals from CDs (even interest payments), but Synchrony gives CD owners the option to withdraw the interest they receive, penalty-free, at any time during the CD term.Finally, Synchrony bank isn\\'t exactly a household name, but you might have used some of its products without knowing it. The bank\\'s primary business consists of cobranded store credit cards, and it partners with some of the largest retail brands to offer credit card products. In addition to its CDs, Synchrony offers high-yield savings and money market accounts, and all of its accounts are FDIC insured to $250,000 per person.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Many different term lengthsCompetitive APYs, especially on 6-month and 12-month CDsUnique CD products availableNo minimum deposit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:CDs automatically renew at maturity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCIT Bank CD\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nCIT is an online bank that offers very competitive rates on certain CD terms, including non-standard promotional terms.

It offers a few non-standard term lengths, such as 11-month and 13-month CDs, which could be a good fit for certain customers. CIT\\'s CDs have a $1,000 minimum deposit requirement, so keep that in mind before opening one. However, the bank offers some unique CD products, such as a 11-month CD with no penalty for early withdrawals.Because of its minimum deposit requirement, CIT might not be the best choice for beginners, especially those who want to put money in several different term lengths to create a CD ladder. It offers highly rated customer service by phone from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m ET on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays. There are also high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and checking accounts available, which makes CIT a smart choice for customers who want to keep all of their bank accounts in one place.You may not be familiar with CIT Bank, but it is a division of First Citizens Bank, which has more than 500 branches in 23 U.S. states. CIT has been in business for 115 years and its banking products are all FDIC insured.

Marcus also offers penalty-free CDs for savers who don\\'t want their money tied up.The bank\\'s CDs require a $500 minimum deposit, which is on the lower end for banks with such a requirement, but could be an obstacle for beginners, especially those who wish to create a CD ladder. One unique feature is the ability to add more money to a Marcus high-yield CD for as long as 30 days after opening the account. Plus, account holders get a 10-day CD rate guarantee, which offers a nice layer of protection if you open an account and interest rates rise shortly after.Another big reason Marcus earned a spot on our best CDs list is that account holders have the option to withdraw any interest earned penalty-free at any time. This isn\\'t offered by many banks, and can be a valuable feature for savers who might want to rely on their CDs for income to cover living expenses.As the name implies, Marcus is the consumer banking division of Goldman Sachs, which is one of the largest investment banks in the world and has been in business for more than 150 years.

Bread\\'s CDs (formally known as the Bread Savings CDs) earn a spot on our list because they offer some of the most competitive APYs of any institution on our radar -- especially for one and two year term lengths -- but there are some potential drawbacks.Bread Savings CDs have a $1,500 minimum deposit, which may be a bit steep for some customers just getting started in the world of CDs, especially for those who want to use multiple maturity term lengths to form a CD ladder. Plus, there are no terms shorter than one year, which can be a dealbreaker for savers who are going to need their money within the next 12 months.Bread Financial might not be a familiar name, but that\\'s because the name hasn\\'t existed for very long. The business has been around since the early 1980s and was formerly known as Comenity Bank, which has been a leading issuer of private-label credit cards for some time. Bread Financial CDs are FDIC insured to a maximum of $250,000 per person, so you\\'re protected in the unlikely event of bank failure.Like most banks. Bread Savings CDs automatically renew upon maturity unless you decide to withdraw your money or change the term. But unlike most other banks, Bread offers slightly higher renewal rates than it offers to new customers (think of it as a customer loyalty bonus).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Very competitive APYs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:No terms shorter than 12 months$1,500 minimum deposit\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlly High Yield CD\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nAlly High Yield CDs are notable for saver-friendly features like no minimum deposits and lower-than-average withdrawal penalties (though you\\'re still better off holding through your CD term!).

For one thing, the bank offers highly competitive APYs, especially on its 9-month, 1-year, and 18-month CDs. Customers who choose to renew their CDs upon maturity get a 0.05% loyalty bonus added to the APY offered at the time of renewal. Plus, Ally CDs have no minimum deposit requirement, making them an excellent choice for beginners or savers who want to create a CD ladder with multiple term lengths.Ally also offers a couple of unique CD products, including its Raise Your Rate CD that comes in 2- and 4-year terms, and allows the customer to adjust their rate upward once (2-year) or twice (4-year) if Ally\\'s rates increase. There\\'s also a 11-month no-penalty CD that allows for withdrawals anytime after the first six days after account funding.Another reason Ally earns a spot on the list is for its highly rated mobile app that lets you open, view, and manage your CDs, as well as any other accounts you may have with Ally. Not all CDs offer mobile access (after all, the logic is that you shouldn\\'t need to manage your account too often by nature).Ally Financial is an FDIC-member bank. It has existed in its current form since 2010, but was previously the financial subsidiary of General Motors, known as GMAC Financial at the time. Because of this, it shouldn\\'t come as a surprise that Ally\\'s primary business is auto lending, but in recent years it has been building its consumer deposit platform, including with its high-yield CDs. However, Ally also offers a full range of banking products and services, such as high-yield savings accounts, online checking accounts, investment accounts, and a variety of lending products. It can be a great choice for someone who wants to maximize the yield from their savings and wants to do all of their banking with the same institution.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Competitive APYs on most term lengthsNo minimum deposit requirementRewards upon renewal of CDsNo-penalty and rate-adjusting CD options\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:Renews automatically unless you cancel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlliant CD\\\\nBottom Line\\\\nAlliant offers CD rates across common terms that stack up well with other banks on this list.

Alliant earned a spot on our list for its high APYs and top-notch customer ratings. You can also open share certificates with any term length from three to 48 months, in monthly increments, For example, if you want a 23-month CD, you can open one, and this flexibility is a big differentiator.Let\\'s start with Alliant\\'s CD APYs. The credit union\\'s CDs have highly competitive APYs, and its 12-month and 18-month CD rates in particular are some of the highest among the banks we follow. Alliant\\'s CDs also have a $1,000 minimum deposit requirement, which isn\\'t the highest we know of but could be an obstacle for beginners or those trying to construct a CD ladder.. There are also Jumbo CDs available -- these have higher rates for certain terms with balances of $75,000 or higher.Unlike the other financial institutions on our best CDs list, Alliant is a member-owned credit union. It has been in business since 1935 and has over 600,000 customers in the United States. Credit unions are not covered by the FDIC, but are insured by the NCUA up to the same limit of $250,000 per person.In order to open an Alliant CD, you need to be (or become) a member of the credit union, which is generally a quick and easy process.

It is an excellent combination of the yields savers typically expect from an online bank, and the convenience of branch-based banking.As mentioned, Capital One offers competitive CD yields, especially for a brick-and-mortar financial institution. It has terms ranging from six months to five years, and has a few non-standard lengths, such as 30-month CDs, in addition to all of the typical lengths. Capital One\\'s 18-month CDs are especially competitive.Capital One CDs have no minimum balance requirements, and can be an excellent choice for beginners or for anyone who wants to create a CD ladder. Accounts are FDIC insured, and unlike some of the CDs on our list, you can choose to have interest paid to you as it is received or leave it in the account to compound.It\\'s worth noting that if your primary goal is to maximize yield, you\\'ll probably find higher APYs through some of the exclusively-online banks on the list. However, you might be surprised how comparable Capital One\\'s yields are, and the convenience factor might make it worth giving up a bit of yield.Capital One is a bank best-known for its credit card business, but it is a full-service financial institution that has 750 branches in several states, including 30 \\\\\"cafe\\\\\" locations. So, not only could it be great for customers who might occasionally need to deposit cash or get in-person assistance, but Capital One CDs can also be a great choice for existing Capital One customers or those who are looking for an all-in-one banking relationship, as Capital One offers a full range of banking products and services.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Competitive APYs, especially for branch-based banksNo minimum depositBranches and cafes are available\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:Higher yields are available through online banks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates as of Sept. 25, 2023\\\\nAPY = Annual Percentage Yield\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrime Alliance Bank\\\\nMINIMUM DEPOSIT $500\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRead Review\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n6 Mo.

Its APYs are generally competitive, but its most competitive yields are paid on terms of 36 months or less. If you\\'re looking for a 4- or 5-year CD, you\\'re likely to find a better rate elsewhere. However, the bank\\'s APYs on shorter terms are highly competitive, especially for 24-month CDs, which are among the best on our radar.Prime Alliance CDs have $500 minimum deposits, which is in the middle of the pack. It can be prohibitive for people new to CDs or those who want to create a CD ladder of several different maturities. However, Prime Alliance could be a good option for people who want to use their CDs for income, as interest is paid quarterly and can be withdrawn as it is paid.Prime Alliance is a relatively small bank, but it offers some excellent products. In addition to its CDs, Prime Alliance has high-yield savings accounts, two different online checking accounts (including an interest-bearing option), as well as deposit products for business customers. It has one branch in Utah, but is mostly an online-focused bank.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros:Competitive APYsNo monthly fees\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons:$500 minimum depositsAPYs are low for some terms\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are alternatives to CDs?CDs are appealing if you\\'re trying to earn a high rate on your savings, but the fact that you cannot touch your money for a set amount of time can be too constraining for some people. If you don\\'t think a high yield CD is a great fit for you, perhaps one of these accounts would work better.Savings accounts vs. CDsHigh-yield savings accounts accounts offer interest rates that are comparable to the highest CD rates. Plus, savings accounts have fewer restrictions on what you can do with your money.

What is a CD and what is it used for?A CD stands for a \\\\u201ccertificate of deposit\\\\u201d and are issued primarily by banks. They are financial instruments that pay either a fixed, variable or stepped up coupon. The most common CDs are those with a fixed coupon. The interest on a CD can be paid daily, monthly, quarterly or even annually. In the United States, CD\\\\u2019s are nearly always insured by the FDIC which is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which is an agency of the federal government. CDs are used as an investment to offer security and a return of principal and the stated interest rate.How do you know if CD rates will go up?Nobody knows for certain if CD rates will increase. CD rates are determined by the bank or financial institution issuing the instrument and typically have a very tight correlation to the US bond market and the corresponding yield that is closest to the maturity of the CD. How does CD laddering work?CD laddering is the method of buying CD\\\\u2019s with consistent, staggering maturities. For example, if you would like to invest $1mm in a CD ladder, you could invest $200k in a CD that matures in 1 yr, another $200k that matures in 2 years, a third $200k that matures in 3 years, etc. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRita-Soledad Fern\\\\u00e1ndez Paulino\\\\n\\\\nCEO of Wealth Para Todos\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRita-Soledad Fern\\\\u00e1ndez Paulino is the founder and CEO of Wealth Para Todos, a financial coaching and education platform dedicated to removing barriers to financial security for marginalized communities. \\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWho is a CD right for?CDs are a great option for people who have already have at least 3 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account for an emergency fund, no debt with an interest rate above 9%, investment accounts funded for retirement, and who are saving for an upcoming expense that they don\\'t plan to purchase for more than a year. People who meet this criteria will want to compare CD rates with HYSA rates and Series I Bond rates to ensure they get the highest interest rate possible. What is a CD and what is it used for?A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a type of savings account that requires you to keep your money in there for a certain period of time in exchange for a guaranteed rate of return. CDs are a great way to earn some extra cash while you sleep without having to worry about the value of your savings ever going down (like you may do when investing in the stock market.) Depending on the CD\\'s interest rates, they could potentially protect your short-term savings from losing its purchasing power due to inflation.How do you know if CD rates will go up?CD rates are impacted by the federal funds rates. When the Federal Reserve expects banks to have more cash reserves, banks try to incentivize people to save more. Since federal chairman Jerome Powell has expressed another upcoming federal fund rate hike, we can probably expect for CD rates to increase a little more. How does CD laddering work?CD laddering consists of opening multiple CDs at different times in order to have access to your money at different times. Instead of taking a lump sum of money and opening one CD, you decide to split that lump sum into multiple CDs opened at different time periods or with different term lengths so you can have access to your money potentially sooner. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCD termThe CD\\'s term is the length of time you agree to not touch your money. It can range from one month on the short end to six years or more on the long end. Most range from six months to five years. You\\'ll usually find the longer the CD term, the higher the interest rate.Minimum depositWhile some of the highest CD rates have no minimum deposit, others may require a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Some jumbo CDs may have five-figure minimum deposit requirements.How interest is paid to youMost CDs add the interest you earn to your account balance, but some give you the option to have your interest paid directly to you. If you go this route, you can reap some of the benefits of your high yield CD immediately. But bear in mind that if you leave the money in your account instead, you can earn interest on your interest, which leads to more money overall.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nWhat happens at the end of your CD term\\\\n\\\\nSome banks automatically enroll you in a new CD of the same term length unless you specify that you want to do something different. It\\'s usually a bad idea to let your bank open a new CD for you. Watch out for this and make sure you tell your bank what you want to do with your money instead.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFDIC or NCUA insuranceCD accounts offered by banks should carry FDIC insurance so your money is protected up to $250,000 per person per account. NCUA does the same thing for share certificates offered by credit unions. Most high yield CDs will have the appropriate insurance, but it pays to be sure.How often rates are raisedStep-up and bump-up CDs occasionally raise your rates. If you\\'re interested in one of these, pay attention to how often you or the bank can increase the rate when you compare CD rates.Whether it\\'s callableSome CDs are callable, which means the bank can call it back from you at some point and reissue you a new CD, possibly at a lower rate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhich banks have the best CD rates?Online banks overwhelmingly offer the best CD interest rates when compared to larger brick-and-mortar traditional banks. In fact, some of our favorite online banks\\' current CD rates are multiples higher than what you\\'d find with a national bank.We\\'ve rarely seen a reason to invest in CDs with a brick-and-mortar national bank, especially when online banks offer the same FDIC insurance protection. CD interest rates at online banks tend to be higher.If looking to compare CD rates, we suggest reviewing some of the current rates on CDs at the following financial institutions:Discover CD ratesCapital One 360 CD ratesAlly CD ratesMarcus by Goldman Sachs CD rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen is a CD a good idea?Fixed-rate CDs are the most popular offerings, and bump-up CDs are worth considering as well. If you\\'re considering opening a CD, here\\'s a scenario-based analysis of when it may be the right time to open one of these CD accounts:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nType of CD\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen Opening One Is a Good Idea\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFixed-rate CD\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen market interest rates are decreasing: This is particularly smart for longer terms, so that you can lock in a high rate. If you wait, interest rates may drop by the time you open a CD.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBump-up CD\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen rates are increasing: Opening a bump-up CD when rates are going up could be a good idea since you can request a rate increase later, so long as the bank offers a higher rate for the same term.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'ll notice it\\'s especially important to keep an eye on current rates on cds in order to know when the right time is to open a CD account.RELATED: What Is CD Laddering? CD laddering can help you optimize your interest earnings. Head to our guide to see if this is the right strategy for your portfolio.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen is a CD a bad idea?It\\'s best to wait to take action on opening a fixed-rate CD when interest rates are increasing. Waiting allows you to snag the best CD rates and helps you avoid locking in a low rate.Bump-up CDs have more flexibility, but they can still be the wrong choice if rates are rising rapidly because you can usually only request a rate increase once per term and might miss out on better rates later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nType of CD\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen Opening a CD Is a Bad Idea\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFixed-rate CD\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen market interest rates are increasing: You risk locking yourself into a low rate for an extended period of time, especially for longer-term CDs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBump-up CD\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen rates are increasing rapidly: This may be a bad idea. You could open a bump-up CD and request a rate increase later, assuming the bank offers a higher rate on the same term, but it may be best to put your money into a high-yield savings account and invest in a CD later.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a CD?A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of FDIC-insured deposit account offered by many banks and credit unions that usually has a fixed interest rate over a certain number of months or years. CD interest rates are often higher than what you find with most savings accounts, but they carry the stipulation that you must not touch the money until the CD term is over. If you withdraw the funds early, you pay a penalty, though some banks allow a CD loan (a loan secured by the money you already have in your CD).How does a CD work?You deposit a certain amount of money into a high-yield CD and agree not to touch it for the length of the CD term in exchange for a high rate of interest that\\'s usually locked in for the full term. Your bank pays that interest monthly or quarterly, and when the CD term is up, you may withdraw the funds and spend them, place them in a savings account, or put them in another high-interest CD.\\\\u00a0Withdrawing your funds before the CD term ends results in a penalty -- usually several months\\' worth of interest. The earlier you withdraw the funds, the larger your penalty will be.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre CD rates fixed?\\\\n\\\\nCD banking rates are usually locked in at the time you open the account, but it depends on the type of CD you have. Bump-up CDs enable you to raise your rates over time, while callable CDs carry the risk that your rates could drop. This can hurt your profits, so you need to be especially careful before you sign up for one of these.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOther CD term lengths to considerCDs are a flexible savings option in that the terms range from months up to 10 years, making them valuable for depositors with an array of short- and long-term needs. Here are the most common CD terms:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 6-month CD ratesBest 1-year CD rates18-month CD rates2-year CD rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 3-year CD ratesBest 4-year CD ratesBest 5-year CD rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan you use a CD for an emergency fund?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUsing a CD for an emergency fund is safer than putting it in the stock market. However, it\\'s not as flexible as a savings account. If you withdraw money from a CD before the term is over, you will have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. Typically it is one to two months of interest earned.Other options for an emergency fund are a savings account, high-yield account, money market account, or a money market mutual fund.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much will a $10,000 CD make in a year?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you invest $10,000 in a 1-year CD at a 1.00% APY, it would make about $100. The amount earned depends on the CD rate. To calculate this yourself, multiply the amount you plan to deposit by the APY that the CD offers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a good CD rate?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA good CD rate in 2023 is 4.00% or higher. Many of the best CDs offer an APY of 4.00% or more on 1-year CDs. Rates like these are much higher than the national average, and you can normally only find them at online banks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre CDs safe?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes. CD deposits are covered by FDIC insurance, which insures depositors for up to $250,000 per person per bank. In the event of a bank\\'s insolvency, this insurance would kick in and cover any lost funds up to that amount.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre CD rates adjustable or fixed?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour CD rate is typically fixed for the term of the CD, unlike savings accounts, where your rate will adjust over time. Specialty CDs like bump-ups have rates that can adjust during the CD term.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Kailey Hagen\\\\n and\\\\u00a0Matt Frankel, CFP\\\\u00ae\\\\nOur Banking Experts\",\"Article Date\":\"September 28, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best Personal Loans of October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/personal-loans\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

Your APR may be as low as 11.49% or as high as 19.49% for the term of your loan. The lowest rate quoted assumes excellent credit, and a loan term of 36 months or shorter. Otherwise, a higher rate will apply. For example, if you borrow $10,000 for 36 months at 15.99% APR, to repay your loan you will have to make 36 monthly payments of approximately $351.52.There is a 0.5% APR discount if you enroll in automatic payments at loan origination. Additionally, existing Citigold and Citi Priority customers will receive a 0.25% discount to the interest rate. If you are in default, your APR may increase by 2.00%. No down payment is required. Rates subject to change without notice.You must be at least 18 years of age (21 years of age in Puerto Rico). Co-applicants are not permitted. Loan proceeds cannot be used for post-secondary educational or business purposes.If you apply online, you must agree to receive the loan note and all other account disclosures provided at loan origination in an electronic format and provide your signature electronically.Credit cards issued by Citibank, N.A. or its affiliates, as well as Checking Plus and Ready Credit accounts, are not eligible for debt consolidation, and Citibank will not issue payoff checks for these accounts. If you are unsure of the issuer on the account, please visit https:\\\\/\\\\/www.citi.com\\\\/affiliatesproducts for a list of Citi products and affiliates.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n*Upstart Loan DisclaimerThe full range of available rates varies by state. The average 3-year loan offered across all lenders using the Upstart platform will have an APR of 21.97% and 36 monthly payments of $35 per $1,000 borrowed. For example, the total cost of a $10,000 loan would be $12,646 including a $626 origination fee. APR is calculated based on 3-year rates offered in the last 1 month. There is no down payment and no prepayment penalty. Your APR will be determined based on your credit, income, and certain other information provided in your loan application.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n*SoFi Personal Loan DisclaimerFixed\\\\u00a0rates\\\\u00a0from 8.99% APR to 25.81% APR reflect the 0.25% autopay interest\\\\u00a0rate\\\\u00a0discount and a 0.25% direct deposit interest\\\\u00a0rate\\\\u00a0discount.

The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly\\\\u00a0rate\\\\u00a0and reflects both your interest\\\\u00a0rate\\\\u00a0and an origination fee of 0%-6%, which will be deducted from any\\\\u00a0loan\\\\u00a0proceeds you receive.Autopay: The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest\\\\u00a0rate\\\\u00a0reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account.\\\\u00a0Autopay is not required to receive a\\\\u00a0loan\\\\u00a0from SoFi.The following payment example depicts the APR, monthly payment and total payments made during the life of a personal loan with a single disbursement. All loan rates below are shown with the autopay discount (0.25%) and direct deposit discount (0.25%).

Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. See SoFi.com\\\\/eligibilityfor details.Direct Deposit Discount: To be eligible to potentially receive an additional (0.25%) interest\\\\u00a0rate\\\\u00a0reduction for setting up direct deposit with a SoFi Checking and Savings account offered by SoFi Bank, N.A. or eligible cash management account offered by SoFi Securities, LLC (\\\\u201cDirect Deposit Account\\\\u201d), you must have an open Direct Deposit Account within 30 days of the funding of your\\\\u00a0Loan.

This discount will be lost during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off direct deposits to your Direct Deposit Account.\\\\u00a0You are not required to enroll in direct deposits to receive a\\\\u00a0Loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRates quoted are with AutoPay.

As a finance expert, I have developed a deep understanding of the intricacies of personal loans -- the good and not-so-good. I believe everyone deserves access to fair and transparent financial products and strive to provide readers with the accurate information they need to make an informed choice. -Dana George, writer for The Ascent, a Motley Fool service\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTake a deeper dive into our personal loan reviews\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCiti Personal Loan ReviewCiti offers loans as small as $2,000, making it a convenient option for a borrower who only needs enough to get by and does not want to carry the debt for long. With a narrow range of interest rates, borrowers don\\'t have to worry about being hit with a sky-high rate. However, with a loan term of up to 60 months, this could be an ideal loan for a person looking to consolidate existing debt.Citi personal loan requirementsCredit score of 750 or moreMinimum annual income of $30,000Age 18 or older (21 or older in Puerto Rico)Social Security numberVerifiable bank accountU.S. citizen or permanent resident\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Citi personal loans different?\\\\n\\\\nCiti stands out from the crowd by capping its current interest rates at under 20%.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSoFi Loan ReviewSoFi offers loans from $5,000 - $100,000, with terms from 24 - 84 months. The lender offers flexible repayment options and unemployment protection. Once the borrower signs the loan papers, the payment can hit their bank account as early as the next day. SoFi is a particularly good option for borrowers who want to use the funds to pay off high-interest credit cards. In fact, SoFi will pay the credit card issuers directly, then reward the borrower with a rate discount for allowing direct pay.

Loans of $1,000 - $50,000 are available, although Upstart does tack on an origination fee of 0% - 12%. Borrowers can choose terms of 36 or 60 months, and may receive their money one business day after signing.Upstart lending requirementsBe 18 years of age or olderHave a valid Social Security numberHave an active bank accountHave an annual income of at least $12,000Be a U.S. citizen or permanent residentNot be a resident of Iowa or West Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Upstart lending different?\\\\n\\\\nWithout a doubt, the thing that sets Upstart apart from its competitors is its willingness to entertain loan applications with credit scores as low as 300.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLightstream Loan ReviewLightStream personal loans are available from $5,000 - $100,000, with no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Applicants need a score of Good credit or greater, but LightStream does allow co-applicants. Loan terms range from 24-144 months (varies by loan purpose). If an applicant has been approved for a personal loan with the same terms by another lender, LightStream will beat that lender\\'s rate by 0.1%.Lightstream lending requirementsHave a valid Social Security numberHave a clear plan for what you want to do with the borrowed fundsBe able to provide evidence of any available assets\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes LightStream loans different?\\\\n\\\\nThe LightStream loan is far less expensive to get into than most loans. That\\'s because there are no origination fees. Another thing that sets LightStream apart is that it allows you to bring a co-applicant who may have a higher credit score or more substantial credit history.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHappy Money Loan ReviewHappy Money is designed for those who want to pay off high-interest credit cards. What sets Happy Money apart is the focus it puts on those who hope to build their credit scores and learn more about their own financial behavior. The lender offers a free six-week email course called \\\\\"Peace,\\\\\" intended to help customers deal with financial stress in a positive way. Loans are available from $5,000 - $40,000 in all states except Massachusetts and Nevada, and come with terms of 24 - 60 months. There is an origination fee ranging from 0% - 5%.Happy Money loan requirementsBe 18 years of age or olderHave a valid Social Security numberHave an active checking accountNot live in Massachusetts or NevadaHave a credit score of 640 or higherHave no current account delinquencies\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Happy Money Unique?\\\\n\\\\nHappy Money is unique among lenders due to programs like Peace, as well as a personality and stress assessment. Rather than simply loan money, Happy Money seeks to educate borrowers and leave them with greater financial confidence. However, Happy Money\\'s current lowest rate is higher than that of many other lenders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAvant Lending ReviewAvant accepts applicants with credit scores as low as 580, significantly lower than the national average. That\\'s the good news. The not-so-good news is that applicants may pay a high interest rate and a loan origination fee of 0% - 4.75%. Plus, Avant charges a late fee of $25 and a returned check fee of $15.Avant lending requirementsHave a monthly income of at least $1,200 (can include alimony, child support, or other maintenance)Have a credit history that includes at least one accountBe able to apply on their own (no joint applications or co-signers are accepted)Live in any state except for Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, New York, Vermont, or West Virginia\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Avant lending different?\\\\n\\\\nAvant is one of the few credible lenders willing to loan money to those with poor credit scores. Loan amounts range from $2,000 - $35,000, making it possible to borrow a relatively small amount of money and pay it back quickly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAchieve Personal Loan ReviewFormerly known as FreedomPlus, Achieve requires applicants to have a minimum credit score of 620. Customers can borrow between $5,000 - $50,000. Terms stretch from 24 - 60 months. Borrowers can also count on paying an origination fee of 0% - 4.99%. The low end of the interest rate is not out of line with other lenders, particularly for borrowers with good rather than excellent credit.Achieve loan requirementsMust be 18 years of age or older in most states; must be at least 19 in Alabama or NebraskaMust be a U.S. citizen or permanent residentMust have a Social Security numberMust provide proof of incomeMust have a verified bank account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Achieve loans different?\\\\n\\\\nAchieve gives applicants with a fair credit score another option to consider. The rates are not the lowest and the fees can be costly, but it\\'s an option that may allow a person to cover the cost of replacing their transmission or repairing tree damage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest Egg Loan ReviewBest Egg borrowers can apply for $2,000 to $50,000. However, the loan will not be cheap. In addition, the only applicants offered the lowest rate must have a FICO\\\\u00ae Score of at least 700 and earn a minimum of $100,000 annually. The high end of the rate will be prohibitively expensive for many borrowers. Best Egg also charges an origination fee of 0.99% - 8.99%, another factor that can make its loans expensive. Loan terms range from 36 - 60 months.Best Egg lending requirementsMust have a minimum credit score of 550Proof of income is requiredMust have a U.S. addressMust have a valid Social Security numberDebt-to-income (DTI) ratio (including mortgage) must be 65% or lessMust live in any U.S. state except: Iowa, Vermont, West Virginia, or U.S. territories\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Best Egg personal loans different?\\\\n\\\\nOne bright spot for Best Egg is the fact that loan proceeds are often in the borrower\\'s bank account as soon as the following day. Not all lenders can say the same.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscover Personal Loan ReviewThe Discover Personal Loan is available in all 50 states plus Puerto Rico. Loan amounts range from $2,500 - $40,000. While $40,000 may not be enough to complete a remodeling project, it should be more than enough to cover a 50th-anniversary party, wedding, or emergency situation. Discover charges no origination fee, saving borrowers money upfront. Currently, terms range from 36 - 84 months.Discover loan lending requirementsMinimum credit score of 660 is requiredApplicant must earn at least $25,000 annuallyMust be 18 years of age or olderMust be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Discover personal loans different?\\\\n\\\\nOne thing that sets the Discover Personal Loan apart is its 30-day guarantee. If a borrower experiences a change in circumstances or even a change in heart, they have up to 30 days to refund the loan in full without paying any interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat to look for with the best personal loansThe lower the interest rate, the more money you save in paying back the loan. A great loan is one carrying a low interest rate. The interest on a loan is calculated as a percent of the total you borrow.Look for your personal loan term sweet spot, the shortest term with the most affordable payment. The best loans fit your budget and timeline. The \\\\\"loan term\\\\\" is the period of time you have to repay a loan in full. Some people opt for a longer loan term because it keeps their monthly payments low. However, the longer you carry a loan, the more interest you pay in total.The best personal loan lenders don\\'t charge an origination fee. Other expenses -- like prepayment and late fees -- are kept to a minimum. Another key trait of a great personal loan is that it has no fees or very low fees. Fees can be sneaky. Say a lender offers you a low interest personal loan, but piles on fees. That loan may end up costing more than a loan with a slightly higher interest rate but no fees.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to get the best personal loan ratesTo get the best rates from loan companies, follow these three steps:Maintain a high credit score. A FICO\\\\u00ae Score of at least 720 is normally enough to qualify for the lowest personal loan interest rates.Get a cosigner. If your credit score is not high enough to qualify for a good interest rate, a personal loan cosigner with an excellent credit score can help you get a better interest rate.Shop around for the best rate. Consider looking at traditional banks, credit unions, or even online personal loans. Do your research to find a lender that is offering the best personal loan rates. Many have an online prequalification tool that will give you a rate without hurting your credit score. In some cases, lenders will offer promotions and limited-time discounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen is a personal loan the best option?If you know how you\\'re going to spend the money and have a plan to repay it, a personal loan can be a good tool for accomplishing your goals. Most lenders don\\'t care how you spend the money, as long as you pay it back as promised.If you need the money quickly, make sure to check the lender\\'s approval and funding timeline. Many lenders offer next day funding, and some even offer funding as quickly as the same day you\\'re approved. The best loans like these can help you overcome financial roadblocks, even when you need cash fast.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDo interest rates matter?Let\\'s compare personal loan rates. Say you need to borrow $20,000 to replace the roof of your house, and you plan to get a loan with a five-year term. You\\'re considering two options: Lender A and Lender B. Below, we\\'ve summarized these two imaginary lenders and how their interest rates would impact the cost of your loan.Even a small percentage change can result in significant savings. It\\'s clear that the lender offering the lower interest rate can save you money over the life of the loan. These are funds you can use in some other way, like investing for your future.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLender AInterest rate: 5.5%Monthly payment: $382Total interest paid over the life of the loan: $2,921\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLender BInterest rate: 6.9%Monthly payment: $395Total interest paid over the life of the loan: $3,705\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou may only pay an extra $13 per month for a loan from Lender B, but that small difference costs you $780 more over the life of the loan. For help finding low interest personal loans, check out our guide to good interest rates for personal loans.What if I have bad credit?You will likely pay a higher interest rate for a personal loan. If this is your situation, you have two options: You can take steps to raise your score and wait until it\\'s in better shape before applying for a loan. The second option is to get a loan now, then refinance your personal loan later (when your credit score is higher and you can get a better rate).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat should personal loans be used for?While personal loans can be used for anything, the key is to use them to improve your financial well-being. Here are some of the best reasons to get a personal loan:Debt consolidation: Credit cards generally have higher interest rates. A personal loan can be used to consolidate your higher-interest debt to a lower-interest loan.Home renovations: Certain home renovations can increase the value of your home. If you have equity in your home, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a better financing option.Career advancement: Paying for professional certifications, education, and training can boost your career prospects and opportunities for promotion or a higher-paying job.Unexpected expenses: People should have an emergency savings account that has three to six months of expenses. If you don\\'t, a personal loan can help cover a family emergency or help you recover from unexpected and expensive inconveniences.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat should personal loans not be used for?Personal loans have higher interest rates than secured loans and if not used properly, can just increase your debt payments. It may be better to cut expenses or find additional ways to increase your income rather than take out a personal loan. Here are some expenses you should not use a personal loan for.Extravagant vacations: A short-term trip can lead to long-term consequences. A personal loan should not be used to fund an elaborate vacation if the loan can\\'t be paid back.Celebrations (weddings\\\\/birthdays\\\\/graduations): If you can\\'t afford to pay the loan back, you shouldn\\'t get a personal loan for events that only last a day. Celebrations generally are planned in advance, so it is better to save up for it.Extra spending money: Taking out a personal loan to raise your standard of living is not a good idea. You should avoid a lifestyle your current finances can\\'t support.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to get a personal loanNo matter where you apply to get a personal loan -- a bank, credit union, or an online personal loan lender -- the application process is the same.Here are the steps to take.Gather documentsNo matter where you apply, the lender is likely to ask for the same documents. Getting them together before you apply can streamline the process and save you a great deal of stress. Here\\'s what you need:Proof of identificationProof of addressList of monthly expensesEvidence of how much your collateral is worth (if you\\'re applying for a secured personal loan)Whether it\\'s a secured personal loan or an unsecured personal loan, the lender may ask about the purpose for the funds. Some personal loans are designated for specific purposes, like those to help consolidate existing debt, but those loan types are relatively uncommon.Shop lendersTake the time to shop for the best lender. Lenders make loan decisions based on a \\\\\"soft\\\\\" credit check, which has no impact on your credit score. This soft credit check gives the personal loan lender a sense of your credit history, including credit card debt and other debt (like an outstanding installment loan). If your credit score is not quite perfect, look for lenders that specialize in personal loans for fair credit or personal loans for bad credit.Don\\'t leave any gaps -- fill out the entire loan application and provide the lender with all documents requested. If you do this, it should not take long to hear whether your loan has been approved. Some of the best lenders let you know within minutes if your application has been approved.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrequalifying for a personal loan\\\\n\\\\nPersonal loan prequalification or pre-approval allows you to get a sense of what loan terms are available. Most prequalification processes use a soft credit check, which doesn\\'t impact your credit score. If you qualify, lenders will let you know how much you can borrow, the interest rate you will be charged, and how long you\\'ll have to repay the loan. You can use this information to compare personal loans. If you do not qualify, you can learn what you need to do to improve your odds of getting a personal loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare loan offersCompare loans of the same type side by side. If you have applied for unsecured loans, compare them only to other unsecured loan offers. And if you\\'ve applied for secured loans, compare them only to other secured loan offers.Here\\'s what to look for:The lowest annual percentage rateA repayment term that fits your budgetLoan amounts that match your borrowing needsLowest loan fees (ideally, you\\'ll find a loan with no origination fee or prepayment penalty)Perks like loan deferment when you\\'re unemployedCommit to a lenderA lender does not run a \\\\\"hard\\\\\" credit check until you let them know you want to proceed with a loan. So if you applied with five banks, only the bank you choose to work with runs a hard credit check.A hard credit check is a deeper dive into your credit history, and it helps the personal loan provider make sure a borrower meets its minimum credit score requirement and has paid bills on time. Although the hard credit check may decrease your credit score, it\\'s typically by less than five points. After a few months of regular payments, your score should rebound to its pre-loan level.Note: If a low credit score means you don\\'t receive a loan offer that works for you, consider taking time to improve your credit score. Boosting your score can only help you in the long run. Small changes like reducing your credit utilization, paying bills on time, and only applying for credit when needed can help raise your FICO\\\\u00ae Score.Sign loan documentsWhether you\\'re working with an online lender or a brick-and-mortar financial institution, most lenders allow you to sign documents electronically. Read through the documents thoroughly before signing. Once you\\'ve signed, you\\'re legally committed to whatever is written inside the four corners of the contract.Wait for loan fundingFunds usually hit your bank account one to 14 days from the time of loan approval. If you need the money quickly, ask lenders about their fund distribution times as you shop for the loan. If you can\\'t wait, make sure to work only with a lender that promises a quick distribution of funds.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat happens if your personal loan application is not approved?If your personal loan request is denied, the first step is to find out the reason. Typically, you will be denied if your credit score does not meet the minimum qualifications.You may have negative items on your credit report, not enough credit history, or high credit card balances. Another reason may be that your income doesn\\'t meet the minimum requirements or your debt-to-income ratio is too high. There are other factors that could impact loan approval, such as your employment history, cash flow history, and available assets.If you are denied, work on improving your credit history and credit score. Making on-time payments makes up the biggest piece of your credit score. Keep your credit card balances and utilization low. Pay down your credit card debt and ask your credit card company to raise your limits to help with your utilization.Avoiding too many hard inquiries can also improve your credit. After you have increased your credit score, you will be in a better position to qualify for a personal loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the alternatives to personal loans? Loans are not for everyone. Depending on your circumstances -- for example, if you need money to fund a project or pay an unexpected expense -- you may want to look at other options.Here are two alternatives to personal loans.Credit cardsA credit card can provide fast cash in an urgent situation. If you qualify for a 0% APR credit card, you have time (typically 12 to 18 months) to pay off the debt with no interest.Only use a credit card with a 0% transfer offer if you\\'re confident you can pay it off in full before the promotional rate expires. At the end of the promotional period, the interest rate shoots up to its standard rate, and you could get stuck trying to pay down debt as high interest piles on top.Secured line of creditA secured line of credit can help you snag the best rates for personal loans. When you take out a secured line of credit or secured personal loan, you typically pay a lower interest rate because you put up something of value as collateral. This may be anything of value, such as a car, home, boat, or jewelry.A line of credit offers greater flexibility. You can borrow up to your credit limit, depending on what you need, and you only pay interest on the amount you borrow.Online personal loan companies rarely offer secured lines of credit, so if that\\'s the route you choose, plan on working with a brick-and-mortar bank or credit union.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to pay off your personal loanSince personal loans typically have higher interest rates, you want to pay them off as fast as you can. You will pay less interest and have more peace of mind if you don\\'t have potentially tens of thousands of dollars to pay back. Here are some simple tips to help you pay back your personal loan faster without breaking the bank. Make sure you check with your lender to see if there are any penalties for paying off your personal loan early.Make bi-weekly payments. Most loans require you to make monthly payments. Instead, make a half-payment every two weeks. By doing this, your payments will be applied to the principal more often, so you end up paying less interest over time. Also, by making payments on your personal loan every two weeks, you will be making 26 total payments per year. This translates to one whole extra payment a year. This can shorten your loan payoff by months and in some cases years.Make an extra payment. If your lender will not allow you to split your loan payments, make an extra payment every year. Use a bonus, tax refund, or additional income for the extra payment. If the amount is too much to pay it at once, divide it by 12 and add it to your monthly payment to spread it out over time. The more money you are able to pay toward the loan, the faster you can pay it off. Consider getting a side hustle, selling things you don\\'t need, or cutting your expenses to put extra money toward the loan.Round up your monthly payment. Round up your loan to the nearest $50 dollars. For example, if your loan payment is $230, round up to $250. For an even bigger impact, you could round up to the nearest $100. In this case, it would be $300. The extra amount may be small enough to not impact your budget, but it would help you pay down your personal loan sooner.Refinance your loan. If you have a high interest rate on your loan, look to refinance to get a better rate. Your credit score may have improved since you got the loan. Shop around to find the best rates.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOther personal loans to compareIf you look through our loan suggestions but don\\'t find a loan that fits your needs, don\\'t worry. No loan fits every borrower or every set of circumstances. Here are a few others to consider:LendingPoint: Good for people with low credit scoresUpgrade: Good for debt consolidation and people with fair creditWells Fargo Personal Loans: Good for low APRs for Wells Fargo customersTaking out a personal loan is a big deal. You\\'re committing to years of working with a specific financial institution and taking on new debt. Take your time to decide if you can comfortably afford a personal loan. If you decide you can, take time to find the loan that\\'s just right for you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow long does it take to pay back a personal loan?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhile the loan term may run anywhere from one to 10 years, a term of three to five years is more common. That said, if you opt for a personal loan with no prepayment penalty, you can pay it off before the term ends. Doing so minimizes the amount you pay in interest.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre personal loans better than credit cards?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPersonal loans normally carry a lower interest rate than credit cards do, and in that way, personal loans are a better option. Another advantage of personal loans is that, unlike credit cards, they don\\'t affect your credit utilization ratio, which you want to be as low as possible. That\\'s why taking out a personal loan to pay off credit card debt often helps your credit score. But personal loans and credit cards both represent debt, and the best financial move is to pay either off as quickly as possible.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow many personal loans can you have?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere is no limit on how many loans you can have from different loan lenders. Some lenders may limit the number of personal loans you can have. Loan companies will consider your debt-to-income ratio, credit score, as well as other factors when determining how many loans you can take out or how much you qualify for. If you have too many loans, then it can impact your credit score, making it more difficult to qualify for new credit or a better rate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow are unsecured personal loan rates different from secured loan rates?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUnsecured personal loan rates generally have higher interest rates than secured loans do. The lender requires nothing more than good credit and your written promise to repay the loan as agreed. Compared to a mortgage or auto loan, personal loan lenders take more risk since there is no collateral to back up the loan in case of a default.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat kind of interest rates do personal loans have?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPersonal loans have a fixed interest rate based on the creditworthiness of the individual applying for the loan. The higher your credit score, the lower you can expect the lender\\'s interest rate to be. Even if your credit score is not as high as you would like, you may still qualify for a personal loan with bad credit. However, you\\'ll likely pay a higher interest rate than other borrowers.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Dana George\\\\n and\\\\u00a0Robin Hartill, CFP\\\\nOur Loans Experts\",\"Article Date\":\"September 27, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best Debt Consolidation Loans of October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/personal-loans\\\\/best-personal-loans-debt-consolidation\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

All personal loans have a 1.85% to 9.99% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.59% APR (which includes a 13.94% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $341.48. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,293.46. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early.\\\\u00a0Personal loans issued by Upgrade\\'s bank partners.

Let\\'s say you have a bunch of little charges, spread across several credit cards (darn you, Starbucks!). Upgrade provides personal loans as small as $1,000. If the idea of debt that minor sounds like bliss because high-interest credit has you by the neck, loans up to $50,000 are available to qualified applicants.Once approved and papers have been signed, the funds will hit a borrower\\'s bank account within four days (often sooner). Terms stretch from two to seven years, allowing you more control over the monthly payment. However, no cosigners are allowed, which is a bummer if your credit score has taken a nosedive. Plus, if your credit score is on the low end, origination fees up to 9.99% can be costly. Once an application is made, Upgrade conducts a soft credit check, which means your credit score won\\'t get dinged.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Upgrade debt consolidation loans different?\\\\n\\\\nUpgrade offers one of the longest repayment terms in the personal loan business.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUpgrade debt consolidation loan requirements\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave a credit score of at least 580Be 18 or 19 years of age, depending on the state in which the applicant livesBe a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or hold an immigration visaHave a Social Security number of passportProvide evidence of U.S. bank account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLightStream debt consolidation loansIn debt but still rocking a (fairly) healthy credit score? LightStream personal loans are available from $5,000 to $100,000, with no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Loan terms ranging from 24 to 48 months allow you to control your monthly payment to some degree. Although you\\'ll need a credit score of 660 or greater, LightStream does allow co-applicants (yes!). If you\\'ve been approved for a personal loan by another lender, LightStream will beat that lender\\'s rate by 0.1%.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Lightstream debt consolidation loans different?\\\\n\\\\nBecause there are no origination fees, LightStream loans cost less than most loans. One thing that sets LightStream apart is that it allows an applicant to bring a co-applicant who may have a higher credit score.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLightstream debt consolidation loan requirements\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave a valid Social Security numberHave a clear plan for what you want to do with the borrowed fundsBe able to provide evidence of any available assets\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSoFi Personal Loans debt consolidation loansSoFi requires a good credit score of 680 or higher. However, if you qualify, the lender offers some pretty attractive benefits, including loan amounts from $5,000 to $100,000. You can also bring a co-borrower if you don\\'t qualify on your own. In addition to same-day funding, SoFi offers unemployment protection if you lose your job and making loan payments is off the table for a while. The lender also considers alternative sources to determine creditworthiness for borrowers who haven\\'t had time to build a long credit history. Unlike many lenders, SoFi charges no origination fee or prepayment penalty.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes SoFi debt consolidation loans different?\\\\n\\\\nSoFi\\'s unemployment protection can be a lifesaver for a borrower who loses their job. Once a job loss has been reported, the lender will put payments on pause for up to three months at a time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSoFi debt consolidation loan requirements\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBe at least 18 years of ageBe a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or non-permanent resident alienHave an income, either from employment or other source. Applicants with an offer of employment scheduled to start within 90 days will also be considered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLendingClub debt consolidation reviewLendingClub is a fintech company working with a network of investors. These investors are specifically looking for people they can loan money to. Loans are available from $1,000 to $40,000, with terms of 36 or 60 months. Because it\\'s a network of investors, there\\'s a good chance you will find funding.Sorry to sound like a broken record here, but if you have a low credit score you\\'re going to get bonked with a much higher interest rate than borrowers with strong credit. If you have a high credit score, you may be better off borrowing from a lender that doesn\\'t charge fees. LendingClub origination fees run from 3% to 6%. That\\'s money you could keep in your bank account.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes LendingClub debt consolidation loans different?\\\\n\\\\nWhat sets LendingClub apart from its competitors is the fact that investors choose which loans they want to fund. And because lenders know they can charge a borrower with a relatively low credit score a higher interest rate, those applicants are more likely to receive funding.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLendingClub debt consolidation loan requirements\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMust be at least 18 years oldHave a verifiable bank accountBe a U.S. citizen or current resident\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRocket Loans debt consolidation loan reviewDid you know that Rocket offers more than home loans? Yep. Rocket also provides personal loans, ideal for consolidating the high-interest debt that\\'s weighing you down. If your credit score is 640 or higher you are eligible to apply for a loan ranging from $2,000 to $45,000. The fly in the ointment is that you could face an origination fee as high as 7% (can you tell we truly dislike origination fees?). Repayment terms are either 36 or 60 months, and you can expect same-day loan approval. You may even receive same-day funding.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat makes Rocket debt consolidation loans different?\\\\n\\\\nRocket is one of the rare lenders that may be able to provide same-day funding.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRocket debt consolidation loan requirements\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMust be at least 18 years of ageMust be a U.S. residentMust have a bank account that can receive payments via ACH\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre there debt consolidation loans for bad credit?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes, there are consolidation loans available if you have bad credit. Here are a few extra steps you can take to increase your chances of getting approved:Check your credit reports for errors. Mistakes can drag your score down. To get started, order a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus. Then, read through each record carefully. If you find a mistake on your credit history, report it to the credit bureau.Get prequalified with multiple lenders. Getting prequalified doesn\\'t affect your credit score -- usually (always ask your lender to confirm, though). By getting prequalified, you can find out whether or not a lender will offer you a loan.Consider secured debt or getting a cosigner. If you\\'re having trouble getting approved for a loan, look into secured loans (loans that require collateral) or asking someone to cosign your loan. Doing one (or both) of these things can make it easier for you to get approved for a debt consolidation loan.For more information, check out our list of best personal loans for bad credit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe best debt consolidation companies of October 2023:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLending Partner\\\\nMin.

Debt consolidation streamlines multiple debt payments into a single payment, using a personal loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the benefits of using a personal loan for debt consolidation?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA debt consolidation program can save you money and time. Here are a few other benefits:Lower interest rate: Most debt consolidation loans have a lower interest rate than credit cards. The best credit card consolidation loans will help you in paying off high-interest debt with a low-interest loan to save you thousands of dollars over the life of a loan.Lower monthly payments: If you have a lower interest rate, you\\'ll likely also have lower monthly payments. If you find yourself worrying about how you\\'re going to repay credit debt or other unsecured debt, a debt consolidation loan can help you lower the total monthly payment due.Clear finish line: From the time a lender approves your consolidation loan, you will know precisely the repayment term and when it\\'s due to be paid off.Fewer bills: Consolidating multiple debt loans into a single personal loan means you will have fewer bills to juggle. If you\\'re busy like most people, having one installment loan to pay can simplify your life. Rather than making sure each credit card payment is sent, writing a check for your auto loan, and double checking that all other bills are covered, you pay a single monthly payment.Higher credit score: You may be able to improve your credit score by making regular payments. Since your credit history plays a role in everything from renting an apartment to whether you qualify for the lowest auto insurance rates, raising your credit score makes life easier. Once you\\'ve achieved excellent credit, you will have access to the best interest rates and loan terms next time you need to borrow money.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the drawbacks of debt consolidation loans?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMost financial decisions, including personal loans for debt consolidation, have pros and cons. Here are some drawbacks:If you use your loan to pay off your credit cards, you may be tempted to use those cards again, leaving you with a consolidation loan and new high-interest debt. New debt leads to a higher debt-to-income ratio, an issue that is factored into your credit score.There is often a sense of relief once you\\'ve paid off high-interest debt, which may tempt you to spend more money or spend unwisely. The entire point of debt loans are to get you out of debt and make your life easier. Whether you take out a secured loan or an unsecured loan, stick to your budget once the loan is paid in full.If you take out a secured loan using collateral, such as your house or your car, to keep the interest rate low, you risk losing that collateral if you miss payments. It\\'s never a good idea to miss payments, but if you\\'re not sure you will make all payments as agreed, consider an unsecured loan instead.The wrong loan can end up costing you money in interest or fees. Make sure you understand all the costs involved and don\\'t inadvertently put yourself in a worse situation. A high origination fee, late payment fees, and prepayment penalty will each take money out of your pocket.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nBudgeting for loan payments\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re getting ready to apply for a debt consolidation loan, start by outlining your current monthly expenses and income. Then, estimate how much you can put toward a loan payment each month. (Remember, the loan payment will replace some of your other debt payments.) That way, you\\'ll know ahead of time what size loan payment is best for you -- and you can confidently work toward paying off that debt.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the alternatives to personal loans for debt consolidation?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPersonal loans for debt consolidation can be a great way to meet your financial goals, but they\\'re not the only option. Here are some alternatives to a debt consolidation loan:Balance transfer credit cardsA balance transfer card offers an introductory rate, most often a 0% APR for a set time period (typically 12 to 21 months). You apply online, give the new credit card company a list of the balances you want to be transferred, and wait to hear back from it. Transfer fees usually range from 3% and 5% of the balance transferred. But beware: The card\\'s interest rate will rise dramatically as soon as the intro period ends. You should plan to pay the card off in full before then.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProsNo interest charges on balance transfers during intro periodMay increase your credit score\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsOnly effective if you stop using credit while repaying the debtTransfer fees chargedInterest rate rises dramatically once the intro period ends\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHome equity loansIf you owe less on your home than it\\'s worth, that means you have equity and can borrow against it. If you use a home equity loan for debt consolidation, you\\'ll owe your mortgage lender instead of your other creditors (like credit card issuers). The interest rate might be lower on a home equity loan than you\\'d pay on a credit card or personal loan. The danger is that you could lose your home if you miss payments.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProsLikely to provide you with a much lower interest rateCan increase your credit score\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsLender has the right to repossess your home (the collateral) if you fail to make paymentsEasy to get into even more debt unless you stop using other available credit (like credit cards)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n401(k) loansWhile the best move with a 401(k) plan -- or any other retirement plan -- is to leave it alone and let it grow, some plans do allow for borrowing. You don\\'t have to worry about your credit score when borrowing from your 401(k) because no credit check is required. A 401(k) loan generally lets you borrow 50% of your 401(k) balance or $50,000, whichever is less (with some exceptions). When you take out a 401(k) loan, you pay interest to yourself by putting your interest payments back into your retirement account. However, if you don\\'t pay back the loan within five years, you will owe income tax and a penalty of 10%.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProsNo credit check requiredIn essence, you repay yourself, with interest\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsThe money borrowed has no opportunity to grow, potentially costing you thousands of dollarsIf the loan is not repaid within five years, you\\'ll pay income tax and a penalty of 10%\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a debt consolidation loan?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA debt consolidation loan is a loan used to pay off other debt. It usually has a lower interest rate than other debt (like credit card debt). You can also use it to pay off multiple debts -- for example, multiple credit cards or loans. Then, you have only one debt payment to remember instead of several.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDoes consolidating debt affect credit scores?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour credit score could climb. Consolidating debt leaves you with more available credit (for example, paid off credit cards). As long as you don\\'t add charges to the cards you just paid off, the \\\\\"debt utilization\\\\\" portion of your credit score improves. In addition, making monthly payments on time helps boost your score.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat credit score do I need for a debt consolidation loan?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe credit score required to consolidate debt depends on the lender. Some lenders that cater to those with poor credit consider applicants with scores as low as 560-580.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much debt can you consolidate?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much debt you can consolidate depends on a number of factors, including your credit history and income.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat does Dave Ramsey say about debt consolidation loans?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRamsey is not a fan of debt consolidation loans, believing that it will take you longer to repay the debt. In his opinion, the longer it takes you to repay the loan, the more interest you\\'ll pay.We recommend you take Ramsey\\'s advice on this topic with a grain of salt.

For example, Better\\'s One Day Mortgage program doesn\\'t exactly complete the entire loan process in a day, but it allows qualified borrowers who submit their paperwork quickly to apply, get a pre-approval, lock their rate, and get a loan commitment -- all within 24 hours. This is much quicker than the typical lender can offer, and Better also aims to provide quicker pre-approval letters for borrowers who haven\\'t picked a home to submit with their offers.Not only is Better very transparent about its current mortgage rates, but the company guarantees that it will beat its competitors. Better offers to match a competitor\\'s rate offer and will give you $100 if they can\\'t do it.The company also generally charges lower fees than the competition, which can make a big difference to your closing costs. Plus, Better offers discounts of as much as $2,000 in lender credits and a refund of 1% of the purchase price if you use a real estate agent that was referred by Better.In addition to being fast, Better offers a user-friendly application process that can be completed almost entirely online (signing the final closing documents is the only part that can\\'t). However, Better\\'s system also assigns buyers a home advisor who can be contacted anytime during business hours if you run into trouble or have any questions during the process. The company will also match buyers with a local attorney to help with closing, and bundle adjacent services such as title insurance, home insurance, and settlement services.Better offers conventional, jumbo, and FHA mortgages. It also offers home equity lines of credit ranging from $50,000 to $500,000. Its mortgages can be originated for purchases or refinancing, and can come with fixed or adjustable rates.Of course, no lender is perfect, and Better is no exception. For example, it doesn\\'t offer VA or USDA loans, or construction loans. It doesn\\'t offer alternative loan programs for self-employed borrowers. And while Better\\'s mortgage professionals are generally excellent, for some buyers there is simply no substitute for face-to-face help in a branch.Pros:Fully online mortgage processFaster pre-approval and closing than competitorsRate transparencyHELOCs availableCons:No VA or USDA loansNo branch locationsNo construction loansLearn more about BetterAxos Bank Mortgage Expert ReviewOur rating: 5.0\\\\/5.00 stars.Axos Bank Mortgage is an online financial institution that offers a variety of consumer banking products such as high-yield savings and online checking accounts and is also a top-rated home loan originator. Its banking products are important for mortgage customers to know about because Axos waives its standard $995 lender fee for customers with at least $500 in an Axos Bank account (and you can open one at the same time you apply for a mortgage).In addition, one of the biggest differentiators between Axos and its competitors is its cash back mortgage feature. Axos offers its banking customers who meet certain requirements 3% annualized cash back on mortgage payments (principal and interest), up to $100 per month.Axos offers several different mortgage products, including conventional, FHA, and VA mortgages. It also offers jumbo loans, which happens to be a specialty of the bank, and is one of the few lenders to offer mortgages of as much as $30 million, and with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios as high as 90%. In addition to these rather standard mortgage types, Axos offers a wide variety of unusual loan types, such as portfolio loans, investment property loans, interest-only mortgages, and more.Axos has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and has been in business for more than 20 years. The bank\\'s application process is fully online, except for closing, which typically occurs in person, even with fully online lenders. It is rather easy to check the bank\\'s current mortgage rates, although you\\'ll need to give your email and phone number to do it.There are a few negatives to consider. Axos is not a standout when it comes to customer support. Unlike many online lenders, Axos doesn\\'t have 24\\\\/7 phone support for home loans, and while it offers chat support, it\\'s through a virtual assistant (not a real-live person). Plus, Axos doesn\\'t offer USDA mortgages, and the requirement of being an Axos banking customer to unlock the best features is a drawback for people who have banking relationships elsewhere.Pros:Lots of loan typesLender fee can be waivedCash back featureHigh-balance jumbo loansCons:Best benefits require an Axos bank accountNo branch locationsNo USDA mortgagesCustomer support is lackingLearn more about Axos Bank MortgageVeterans United Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.0\\\\/5.00 stars.Veterans United is a good choice if you\\'re looking for a VA loan. It is the number one VA lender in the U.S. and exclusively originates this particular type of mortgage, and that\\'s the primary reason it earns a spot on our top mortgage lenders list.Veterans United has an online application process that makes it easy to request a rate quote for either a purchase or refinancing loan. However, while the lender is primarily online, Veterans United Home Loans does have a network of 25 physical branches throughout the United States. This is one reason why Veterans United gets top marks for customer service, and there is also 24\\\\/7 live phone support available, making Veterans United a great choice for qualified military personnel, even if they\\'re stationed overseas.The company provides credit counseling services to help borrowers get their scores up to the lender\\'s 620 minimum and its staff are experts in the VA loan process.As with other VA lenders, borrowers are not required to make a down payment, and have the ability to roll the VA funding fee into their loan, keeping out-of-pocket costs to a minimum.The main drawback is that Veterans United only offers VA loans. If you are not qualified for a VA loan, Veterans United will match you with a lending partner to help you. But Veterans United has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, as well as a 4.84 out of five star rating based on nearly 2,700 customer reviews on the BBB platform. This is among the highest of any financial services business on our radar.Pros:VA loan expertsOnline application processTop-notch customer serviceCons:Only offers VA loansLearn more about Veterans UnitedCaliber Home Loans Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.5\\\\/5.00 stars.Caliber Home Loans offers a variety of mortgages through a user-friendly digital application process. One of Caliber\\'s biggest strengths is that it offers a wide variety of home loans. In addition to conventional, FHA, VA, and USDA loans, Caliber also offers jumbo loans, home renovation loans, and several programs designed to provide low-down-payment financing, especially to lower-income and first-time home buyers.It also offers a Smart Series loan program for self-employed individuals and real estate investors, and this is the primary reason it earns a spot on our list.Speed is also a big strength of Caliber Home Loans. It claims to be able to close purchase mortgages in as little as 10 days for borrowers who quickly submit the required documentation. Plus, Caliber is a mortgage servicer unlike many lenders who sell the rights to service their loans after closing, and this can make it easier to transition from closing to repayment.There are certainly a few downsides that borrowers need to be aware of. Rate transparency is a major drawback. While many of the other companies included on our top mortgage lenders list make it easy to view their current rates, or even get personalized rate quotes, Caliber does not. You\\'ll need to make a formal loan application to see what your rates will be.Caliber also doesn\\'t offer home equity loans or HELOCs, so if you want those, you\\'ll need to look elsewhere. And customer satisfaction is a mixed bag. It has below-average marks in the J.D. Power U.S. Primary Mortgage Servicer Satisfaction survey, but also holds an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, which indicates that customer complaints are addressed quickly. In a nutshell, Caliber can be a great choice if you want a quick and efficient closing process, especially if you\\'re a first-time buyer.Pros:Wide variety of loan typesFirst-time home buyer programsLoans for self-employed borrowersQuick closings availableCons:No HELOCs or home equity loansLack of rate transparencyLearn more about Caliber Home LoansloanDepot Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.5\\\\/5.00 stars.loanDepot is a mortgage lender that is a combination of an online lender and a branch-based mortgage originator. While the entire mortgage process (other than closing) can be handled digitally, there are some branches for people who might benefit from in-person help.loanDepot offers some of the most popular mortgage products, such as conventional loans, FHA loans, and jumbo loans, and the company is one of the largest VA lenders in the market. It also offers renovation loans for buyers who want fixer-uppers.The company\\'s smartloan platform enables loandepot to expedite the mortgage process by digitally verifying assets, income, and employment. And it finds unique ways to make the process faster, such as waiving appraisal requirements if there are enough recent comps in the area. loanDepot claims that borrowers can close on loans as many as 17 days faster than competing platforms. The company has been in business for 13 years and has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, which indicates that customer issues get addressed in a timely manner.There are some potential downsides to loanDepot that you should be aware of. It doesn\\'t offer home equity loans or HELOCs, and it doesn\\'t have USDA loans for rural buyers. Plus, its rate transparency isn\\'t great -- you need to fill out an application to get any personalized rate offers.In short, loanDepot is a solid option if you want one of the standard loan types they offer, especially if you\\'re closing on a tight timetable.Pros:Specializes in VA loansEfficient online platformCons:No USDA loansNo home equity loans or HELOCsLack of rate transparencyLearn more about loanDepotNew American Funding Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.5\\\\/5.00 stars.New American Funding offers a wide variety of mortgage products, but focuses on helping minorities and other underserved parts of the population achieve homeownership.First, the variety in mortgage products, New American offers standard conventional loans as well as all three main government-backed loan programs (VA, FHA, and USDA loans). In addition, the company offers non-standard loans such as stated income loans for self-employed borrowers whose tax returns don\\'t reflect their true income, home improvement loans, and even reverse mortgages for older homeowners. One unique feature is that New American\\'s mortgages aren\\'t in just the standard 15, 20 and 30-year terms -- borrowers can choose a custom loan term ranging from eight to 30 years. In other words, if you want a 27-year mortgage, New American deserves a spot on your short list.In addition, New American does a great job of helping borrowers find down payment assistance, and can approve some borrowers with higher debt-to-income (DTI) ratios than the industry\\'s standard 45% maximum. Plus, unlike some of its peers, New American publishes its current mortgage rates right on its website.There\\'s no such thing as a perfect lender, and New American isn\\'t an exception. Its application process is not fully digital, unlike some competitors, and it doesn\\'t offer home equity loans or HELOCs.New American Funding has an A rating from the Better Business Bureau and has been in business for 24 years. It is one of our top mortgage lenders for first-time home buyers, thanks to its focus on lending to underserved communities and customizable loan terms.Pros:Wide variety of loan typesFocus on underserved and first-time borrowersFlexible loan termsRate transparencyCons:No home equity loans or HELOCsLearn more about New American FundingGuaranteed Rate Mortgage Expert ReviewOur rating: 4.0\\\\/5.00 stars.Guaranteed Rate Mortgage is a technology-focused mortgage company that aims to make the home-buying process as efficient and easy as possible.The experience starts with Guaranteed Rate\\'s website, which is extremely user-friendly.

Not only can you easily view the lender\\'s current mortgage rates online, but you can even see how paying discount points could help your interest rate and monthly payments. The company also allows customers to lock their rates before they start shopping, and take advantage of a lower rate if they fall before the borrower closes on their home. The mortgage process is completed through PennyMac\\'s user-friendly online portal, known as its Mortgage Access Center.PennyMac has some unique features, such as flexible-term loans that can have term lengths other than the standard 15, 20, and 30-year lengths. It is very transparent about its lender fees, and often offers promotions and credits that make it lower. Plus, as one of the largest mortgage servicers, PennyMac continues to service all of its own loans after closing. If you\\'ve ever bought a home and had your mortgage shuffled between banks, you know that this can be quite a pain point.There are some negatives to keep in mind. PennyMac offers flexible term loans but doesn\\'t offer any loan types that aren\\'t the standards that many other lenders offer as well. Plus, PennyMac has a few physical branches, but not in many markets, so if you want in-person help, it might not be ideal.PennyMac has been in business for 15 years and has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, as well as mostly positive customer reviews on the platform.

SoFi offers conventional, FHA, VA, and jumbo mortgages, as well as HELOCs, and is likely to add more products over time. For example, VA loans are new to the platform.One of the best things about SoFi is its relationship benefits. If you have another account with SoFI, such as an investment account or personal loan, you can get a discount on your mortgage fees. And even if you don\\'t already have a relationship with SoFi, having a mortgage with the company can get you discounts on other financial products you may eventually need.One somewhat rare feature is that SoFi will allow you to check your personalized mortgage rates without a hard credit check and just a quick pre-qualification form. And SoFi is one of the few mortgage lenders that offers a $0 origination fee. And if your loan doesn\\'t close on time (and it isn\\'t your fault), SoFi will pay as much as $5,000.There are a few drawbacks to SoFi Mortgage. As mentioned, it only offers a few different loan types right now. For example, if you\\'re looking for a USDA mortgage, SoFi isn\\'t right for you. And it offers a rate lock program, but it has an expensive fee if you don\\'t go through with a loan.Although SoFi has grown rapidly in recent years, it has actually been in business for well over a decade and has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau. The bottom line is that SoFi is a solid mortgage option if you\\'re looking for one of the standard mortgage types, especially if you\\'re already a SoFi customer.Pros:Tons of financial products in one placeRelationship discounts and benefitsTop-notch mobile appView rates with no credit checkCons:Few loan typesHigh fee for rate lock if you don\\'t closeLearn more about SoFi Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReveal Reviews [ + ]\\\\nHide Reviews [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare Mortgage RatesToday\\'s Mortgage Rates | Refinance Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe best mortgage lenders\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow The List [+]\\\\nHide The List [-]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNo lender fees and 100% online application:\\\\n\\\\nBetter\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiverse loan products and cash back rewards:\\\\n\\\\nAxos Bank Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTop customer service and streamlined online app.:\\\\n\\\\nRocket Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiverse loan types and terms:\\\\n\\\\nNew American Funding\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDigital experience & down payment assistance:\\\\n\\\\nGuaranteed Rate Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRefinancing and FHA\\\\/VA options:\\\\n\\\\nloanDepot\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVA loans:\\\\n\\\\nVeterans United\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHigh loan amounts and relationship discounts:\\\\n\\\\nSoFi Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiverse loan options:\\\\n\\\\nBank of America Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNo mortgage insurance option:\\\\n\\\\nNavy Federal Credit Union Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiverse loan offerings:\\\\n\\\\nPNC Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEasy online application:\\\\n\\\\nPennyMac Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFirst-time buyers:\\\\n\\\\nFlagstar Bank Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnline experience:\\\\n\\\\nAlly Mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSelf-employed borrowers:\\\\n\\\\nCaliber Home Loans\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRatings Methodology\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCheck Rates  for Better\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n 2023 Award Winner\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCheck Rates  for Better\\\\n\\\\nOn\\\\nBetter\\'s\\\\nSecure Website.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest for: No lender fees and 100% online application\\\\n\\\\nBetter\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

While it\\\\u2019s impossible for us to rate and review every offer on the market, we canvas as far as we can, reviewing the largest mortgage providers in the United States, and continuously reviewing the mortgage companies and mortgage lenders that enter, and exit, the space.Our five-star rating system takes into account their ease of providing quotes to all borrowers, how comparatively competitive their mortgage rates and fees are, the quality of their online experience and customer support, as well as how versatile a loan is including finance flexibility, repayment terms, down payment options and ease of closing process.For rating mortgage lenders, and assigning mortgage provider award winners by category, we are keenly focused on industry factors and user benefits, including:Competitive rates and feesCustomer serviceOnline experienceLoan optionsTop-rated offerings were selected that we think represent the top pick for the average customer in each category. Our final awards winners were determined by vote to ensure objectivity, with a final Golden Rule check: would we recommend them to a family or friend? Special attention was also paid to:The application processGeographic availabilityCustomer service channel optionsDown payment optionsWhat is a mortgage lender?A mortgage lender is a financial institution that lends money for home loans. Mortgage lenders can come in a few forms; your bank or credit union may offer mortgages, in addition to other bank accounts, or the company could specifically be focused on mortgage lending.Remember, before signing any agreement, make sure you review all of the terms of the contract and completely understand each aspect, including what fees, known as closing costs, you will need to pay when you buy a home.Loan TypesNot all lenders offer all types of mortgage loans. If you need a larger \\\\\"jumbo loan,\\\\\" or a government-backed loan, you\\'ll need to find a mortgage lender that offers it.What types of home loans should I consider?Conventional and government-insured loans may only require a 3% down payment, while other loans require 20% down. If you\\\\u2019re buying rural, you may qualify for a USDA loan, while veterans should consider VA loans.Knowing the different mortgage options can help you understand which options are best for your lending needs.Mortgage lenders offer different types of loans, and knowing which type of mortgage loan is best for you to apply for, depends on your specific lending needs. Loan type, interest rate, and loan term can vary from one mortgage lender to another, so comparing multiple lenders is often the best move for home buyers.Conventional mortgages are loans without a guarantee from any government agency, and could require a downpayment as low as 3-5%. Conventional loans are funded by private lenders, like the ones featured in our best mortgage lenders list\\\\u00bbWhat mortgage term is best?First, let\\'s talk about mortgage terms, which is simply just the time you have to pay off your mortgage and own your home! Here are the most common mortgage term lengths:Common Fixed Mortgage Term Lengths: The interest rate stays the same for the entirety of the loan term, so your monthly mortgage payments are spread out evenly through the term of the loan. This option is great with low interest rate environments - make sure to ask about rate lock if you think rates may increase to secure that lower interest rate!15-Year Mortgage Payoff Term20-Year Mortgage Payoff Term30-Year Mortgage Payoff Term (most common)Common Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM) Term Lengths: The interest rate stays the same for a certain period of time (sometimes up to 10 years), and then may change (adjust) at specified intervals (usually every six months).5\\\\/1 ARM Payoff Terms7\\\\/1 Arm Payoff TermsSo, why does that matter? Well, the longer your mortgage term, the longer you have to pay. This normally translates to a lower monthly mortgage payment. But which mortgage term is right for you can depend! Check out this video for an example of a 30 year mortgage vs a 15 year mortgage.In this video, Dan Caplinger, The Motley Fool\\'s director of investment planning, compares the rates and payback terms of a 15 year mortgage vs a 30 year mortgage.Key video takeaways: A 30-year mortgage provides more payment option flexibility by allowing you to make lower monthly payments, but the ability to make larger payments, or more frequent payments when you can, to pay your mortgage off earlier. He also points out that you may have a better chance of getting a 30 year mortgage approved in tougher lending environments, since the lower monthly mortgage payment amount will be a smaller portion of your overall monthly income.Government-backed mortgage loans or conforming loans are backed by the Federal government and have different requirements, based on your scenario:VA mortgage loan (offered through the Veterans Administration) - VA loans do not require a down payment and are available to active duty and military veterans. Note: a one-time VA funding fee is required but it can be rolled into the mortgage loan payment and does not have to be paid upfront.USDA loan (offered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Housing Loan Program) - USDA mortgages do not require a down payment and are an option for homebuyers in rural areas, some eligible towns, and some borrowers with a lower income. Note: an annual guarantee fee must be paid upfront, but you do not have to pay for PMI.FHA loan (offered through private FHA-approved mortgage lenders, and insured by the Federal Housing Administration) - FHA mortgages are great for low down payment options (sometimes as low as 3.5% down) and often accommodate lower credit scores, or borrowers that have experienced bankruptcy. FHA loans can also be used for different types of homes from single and multi-family to condos and manufactured homes. Note: mortgage insurance is required.Qualifying requirements to get a home loanMortgage lenders vary in terms of qualifying requirements: interest rates, fees charged, and a host of other factors. Some lenders have stricter standards than others for credit score, income, employment history, and other qualifying factors. For example, some lenders may offer better terms to borrowers with poor credit than other lenders do. Or some may be more forgiving of a low down payment or high debt balance.Required down paymentFor conventional loans, lenders may require a 20% down payment to avoid private mortgage insurance. That\\'s insurance homeowners pay for to protect against lender losses in the event of foreclosure. However, it\\'s possible to find lenders willing to offer loans with less money down. That\\'s especially true if you choose a government-backed loan.Common fees when getting a home loanHome Loan fees, lender fees, and costs associated with a mortgage:Mortgage loan origination fees: It\\'s common to see an origination fee that includes application costs, costs for a credit check, and underwriting fees. Most of these lender fees are paid as part of your closing costs. Some lenders charge more fees than others, but fees could total in the thousands.Interest rates: Interest is the cost of borrowing. The lower the rate, the lower the monthly payment and total costs. The best mortgage lenders offer a more competitive interest rate, but interest rates are also impacted by your credit score, credit report findings, and your location. See more about how mortgage interest rates are impacted by rate environments\\\\u00bbPMI is Private Mortgage Insurance, which is required when the downpayment on your home is less than 20% of the home\\'s value.Reasons to avoid PMIHow to get rid of PMIAdditional fees: You may also have appraisal and titling feesMost common fees associated with home ownershipHomeowners insurance is often a mortgage lender required policy that must be obtained when you purchase a new home as a protection if your house needs repairs. Since the lender technically owns the property until you\\'ve fully paid off the loan, they want to ensure insurance is in place to protect their investment, and so should you! Homeowners insurance policies can vary based on property type. Check out this guide to homeowners insurance premiums.HOA is short for homeowners association and is a governing body of some neighborhoods that often require a monthly, quarterly, or annual fee once you move in. Make sure you ask about HOA fees to ensure you pad that into your budget, and check out why it may be worth it to move into a development that has a home owners association. Learn more about homeowners association (HOA) feesMaintenance and repair costsProperty taxes, which can vary by stateUnderwriting process approval timeFind out how long it will take your mortgage provider to have a loan approved; some mortgage lenders are able to complete the loan approval process much more quickly. This could be a factor if you\\'re on a tight deadline.ReputationA lender\\'s reputation for customer service does matter a little. You want the application process to be easy and pleasant. But be aware that many lenders resell mortgages. There\\'s a chance the original lender you borrow from will not remain your loan servicer for long.Important mortgage terms and topics to knowHome Equity also referred to \\\\\"equity\\\\\" is short, relates to the amount of your home you have already paid off.This is important because you can use your home equity as collateral to borrow against using a Home Equity Loan or HELOC (home equity line of credit).

Due to the size of the mortgage industry in the U.S. there are many lending platforms and mortgage information sites on the internet. I searched for \\\\\"mortgage rates\\\\\" and ended up with 674 million results. For comparison purposes, searching for \\\\\"NFL\\\\\" brought up 496 million results. Granted, this could result in decision paralysis with this much information. I would recommend starting with your current bank\\\\/credit union, and include other lenders from [review] sites. It is likely the lender you choose will end up selling your loan through the mortgage-backed securitization process. So focus on lower rates and fees. Customer service is less under your control.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?The loan decision is standardized in the mortgage market due to the participation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (two government-sponsored enterprises that buy and sell about half of U.S. mortgages). FICO\\\\u00ae Score, current income, and availability of money for a down payment are the most important factors. The efficiency of the mortgage market works against underserved communities where the ability to build a prime FICO\\\\u00ae Score (above 720) can be more difficult. If you do not have the opportunity to build a credit history then it is more difficult to obtain an affordable mortgage. Therefore, the issue for underserved communities is the opportunity to create a solid credit history.What\\'s one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?Building a credit history is the key. This starts with on-time payment of bills (utilities, cable, cellphone) and then moves on to other opportunities like credit cards. Utilizing a credit card as a debit card, for only small-ticket purchases that can be paid off in full every month, also helps build credit. There are also programs through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\\'s FHA program targeted directly at helping underserved communities become homeowners.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClifford Rossi\\\\n\\\\nExecutive-in-Residence and Professor of the Practice at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can homebuyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender? First, ever since the financial crisis in 2008, a number of measures were taken to strengthen and improve oversight of mortgage lending practices in the industry. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was established in part to address many of the deficient and sometimes predatory lending practices that occurred at that time. As a result, mortgage lenders, even those nonbank mortgage entities that are not regulated as closely as commercial banks and other depositories at the federal level must comply with all applicable federal state and local laws regarding mortgage lending. Generally, in shopping around for a lender you can trust, I would look at their track record in terms of complaints which are available at the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database. References from friends and family are another good way of benchmarking lenders in terms of how they handled the loan process. Regulated depositories, according to my research, tend to have far less operational problems in loan origination than nonbank financial institutions in terms of how they follow the process required to underwrite borrowers for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac-eligible loans. So that might be another factor to consider as well.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities? We are approaching the end of a very long secular decline in interest rates that has spanned decades. At some point we expect the Fed to begin the process of taking measures that will start to raise interest rates including US Treasuries. Since the 10-year US Treasury yield is the benchmark for setting 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates, we should expect that higher rates are going to dampen demand for mortgages at some point. Lower income borrowers, including minority borrowers, are going to feel the impact first of higher interest rates which will further put the dream of homeownership out of reach during a period of time when there are acute housing affordability issues already.What\\'s one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I\\'ll offer a few tips. The first is one that every borrower needs to do first. Check your credit score and credit history through one of the readily available credit reporting companies and services and find out if there are any issues that you can address prior to applying for a mortgage. The second tip is look at your current finances. Add up all your outstanding monthly debt including credit card, student debt and the like and divide that by your monthly income. The lower that debt-to-income ratio is, the better chance you have at getting a loan. Also, determine how much money you have to put down on a home. Make sure you leave yourself with enough cash or short-term assets that you can tap for an unexpected event and for home maintenance. If you are a first-time homebuyer, do some homework or take a class on what to expect in owning a home. These activities can really help put you in good shape to find the right home and mortgage for your family.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChester S.

They also should try potentially to clarify the servicing process with the lender (or even check with other borrowers of the lender about their experience, if feasible).How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?The decline in interest rates has contributed to high house prices and loan values, as buyers would bid more aggressively.What\\'s one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I would reinforce my advice (above) -- it is very important for home buyers to undertake ample search so as to ensure that they are receiving favorable pricing on their loans as underserved communities are especially vulnerable to attempts to exercise market power. This may be at the heart of the meaning of a community being \\\\\"underserved.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichael Manahan\\\\n\\\\nLecturer at California State University Dominguez Hills, Author and Consultant\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?The first thing to understand about home lenders is that many of the companies that advertise mortgage loans are not really lenders. They are brokers. The money is not coming from them -- it is coming from a lender (to whom the broker takes the loan). As an example, I financed my last mortgage through Right Choice Mortgage. However, the loan was made to me from Glendale Credit Union.The second thing to understand is that even if you go directly to a lender, the lender may still act as a broker. A lender, such as Bank of America, could give you a mortgage. But they could just as easily \\\\\"sell off\\\\\" the mortgage to a group of investors in the mortgage aftermarket. Why? Because this frees up the bank\\'s capital to make more loans.Who you choose to help you obtain a mortgage really depends on two things: 1) Your personal financial situation and, 2) What sort of relationship you want with a mortgage lender. If you have a complex personal financial situation, such as having multiple sources of income, being self-employed, having investment properties, and owning LLCs, or previous bankruptcies, you may find that some mortgage companies don\\'t want to bother working with you (because it will take more time and effort to get your mortgaged approved). Also, many of the large automated or semi-automated mortgage companies where you apply online don\\'t have the right \\\\\"boxes\\\\\" on their application for you to explain everything. You can end up in a quagmire of endless frustration working with these companies.Even if you have a straightforward financial situation, you still must decide what sort of relationship you want with the mortgage company. Are you okay doing everything online or do you need to fill out forms by hand? Do you want to speak to the same person every time or are you okay with talking to whichever one of the hundreds of people in the call center answers the phone? Do you need someone who can walk you through the process and explain things to you, or are you an old \\\\\"mortgage pro\\\\\" who understands how the system works? Making the right decision will make your mortgage application process a whole lot easier.Whoever you choose to work with to get a mortgage, before getting in too deep, find out how they do business and if their style fits in with your needs. Finally, if you do use one of those online brokers, if you can\\'t find the phone number on the home page, don\\'t use them.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?Interest rate changes affect home buying. When interest rates drop, homes become more affordable because loan payments go down. As an example, if you purchased a home for $600,000 (the average price of a home in California) and put 20% down, you would have a $480,000 mortgage. At 3% interest your payment before taxes and insurance would be $2,024. At a 5% interest rate, your payment would be $2,577, or 27% higher. As lenders typically look for your cost of housing to be no more than 30% of your income, lower interest rates should allow more people to get mortgages, and higher interest rates will restrict mortgages.However, changes in mortgage interest rates do not affect all communities the same. Obviously very rich people, who may still mortgage their homes for tax or financial planning purposes, have few restraints on their ability to get a mortgage. At the lower end of the scale, the least expensive house may continue to sell well when interest rates rise because there are many programs to help underserved and first-time buyers. FHA loans are specifically intended for lower-income, lower-credit, and\\\\/or first-time home buyers. This program, which is backed by the Federal Housing Administration, makes it easier to become a homeowner by relaxing the standards borrowers must meet to get a mortgage.The communities that get hit hardest (or benefit the most) when interest rates change are those communities where the home prices are above average, but not high enough to be of interest to rich people. As an example, in California, that might include communities where the home prices are in the $1 million to $1.5 million range. I recall the recession of 2008, when the value of real estate dropped substantially, there was still demand for the least expensive houses and still demand for mega-mansions of the rich. But those million-dollar homes couldn\\'t find many buyers.What\\'s one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I offer three tips to members of underserved communities to get the best rates possible. First, do whatever you can to improve your credit score. Even in underserved communities credit scores are one of the primary indicators of credit worthiness used by our financial system.Second, work with a bank or lender that is familiar with all the programs that are available to underserved communities. Some mortgage companies may not want to use these programs because they may be extra work. Find a mortgage company who can talk frankly to you about those programs that are available and that you can use to your benefit.Finally, make sure the mortgage company knows that you are a member of an underserved community. Today when we do a lot of business online or on the phone, it may be difficult for the lender to know that you are member of an underserved community which under the broad-based definition recently provided by the White House is said to include \\\\\"people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.\\\\\" That definition covers a lot of people.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScott Deacle\\\\n\\\\nAssociate Professor of Business and Economics and Department Chair at Ursinus College\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?The most effective way is to get quotes from multiple lenders. Time consuming as it is, the extra work pays off with leverage in your discussions with those lenders. If you know what other lenders are offering, each lender is likely to try to match or beat the rates you are getting with other lenders.Another way is to obtain a mortgage from the bank or credit union where you have your checking or savings accounts. Such lenders sometimes offer discounts to their account holders.You can also compare the rates lenders are offering to national benchmark rates, such as those published by Freddie Mac.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?I think changing interest rates have similar impacts across communities. When interest rates fall, they generally fall for all borrowers.What\\'s one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?Many issues surrounding loans to members of underserved communities stem from issues with credit scores and credit reports. My one tip is to obtain the free credit report to which you are entitled by law and review it for inaccuracies before applying for a mortgage. If there are errors in your credit report, correcting them will improve your credit score, which in turn could get you a lower interest rate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding the Mortgage Loan ProcessMortgage lenders set the terms of your mortgage, including the mortgage interest rate, your creditworthiness, and home loan repayment schedule, based on their assessment of your ability to pay back the loan. All of this is determined in the \\\\\"underwriting\\\\\" process, before you are offered a unique loan option.Whether you are a first time homebuyer, considering buying a second home, or ready to get financing for an investment property, there are mortgage basics that you\\'ll need to know for each scenario, and essential mortgage guides to help make getting a mortgage as seamless as possible. Understand how the mortgage process works\\\\u00bbRemember: you can switch mortgage lenders anytime before servicing begins (before your home loan is issued). If service has already started, or you\\'ve already made your first payment, you\\'ll need to refinance your home to switch mortgage lenders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ntip_light_bulb\\\\nexported from figma\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSaving on Mortgage Costs\\\\n\\\\nAsk your mortgage lender if any mortgage fees can be rolled directly into your mortgage loan, or whether you will need to pay them out of pocket.And, if you have any other existing accounts with the lender you choose, ask about any mortgage relationship discount offers for your home loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBefore Your Start Shopping for a HomeSelecting your mortgage financing company and terms may seem a bit overwhelming, but we\\'re here to help!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPreparing for Financing a Property\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGet ready to gather some serious documentation!

More importantly, mortgage preapprovals also go a long way when you\\\\u2019re ready to make an offer.

And check that you can qualify for the loans they offer.Since every borrower has a slightly different lending profile, there isn\\'t one mortgage lender that\\'s best in every situation.

There\\'s no one lender that\\'s the best for every borrower. That\\'s because your rates and costs are largely determined by your particular financial situation.For example, some lenders may offer better terms to borrowers with poor credit than other lenders do.

And interest may be tax deductible. Use this mortgage calculator to estimate different mortgage scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre mortgage loans secured loans?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHome loans offered by mortgage providers are typically secured loans. That means your house acts as collateral, and can be taken by the lender if you don\\'t pay the loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a hard money lender and how does it work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHard money lenders are generally private investors or private companies, not traditional mortgage lenders, that can help finance investment or commercial properties.What\\'s the difference between getting a mortgage and a hard money loan?Both hard money loans and traditional mortgages are secured loans which use your property as collateral, but hard money lenders are focused specifically on lending out hard money loans, using your property, or an asset, as collateral.A hard money loan is a short-term, non-conforming loan whereas a traditional mortgage is generally a longer term conforming loanFinancing for a hard money loan is only applicable for investment or commercial properties vs traditional mortgages which can also cover primary & secondary residences and other property types.Hard money lenders aren\\\\u2019t subject to the same rules & regulations as traditional mortgage lenders (conforming loan lenders)Hard money lenders may require the borrower to prove a history of successful house flips or investing endeavors to get approvedHard money loans generally have higher interest rates vs traditional mortgage lenders because of the higher lending risk they are takingHard money lenders generally require large down payments vs traditional mortgage lendersHard money lenders have a smaller pay-back window vs traditional mortgage lenders. Repayment periods for hard money loans may just be a few years vs an option for a 15 or 30 year term with traditional mortgages.Why would you get a hard money loan?Common reasons people look to hard money loans: financing for flipping houses, purchasing an investment property, financing a commercial propertyHard money loans and lenders may have a faster approval process time (sometimes funding can be within days) vs traditional mortgage lenders (which may take a month or more within the underwriting process).Why? It\\'s based on the value of the property you want to purchase vs your own creditworthiness (less focus on debt-to-income DTI ratios, credit scores, credit history, etc.).Hard money lenders may also promise to close and provide financing within just a few days.Investors may turn to hard money lenders if their application for a traditional mortgage loan is denied, though we always recommend improving your credit score to be able to take advantage of better financing options.

Or, if you have significant equity in the home, you could choose to get a new loan for a higher amount and get some cash in the process.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhy should I refinance with one of the best mortgage lenders?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRefinancing your mortgage is a great way to access your home equity or change the financial circumstances around your mortgage. It can be a powerful weapon for a homeowner who\\'s kept up with their mortgage payments.In fact, you might not even have to leave your house or pick up a phone to complete the entire refinancing process! Some of our favorite mortgage companies have streamlined the process, and you might be able to refinance your mortgage entirely online.You may want to refinance your mortgage if you\\'re looking to:Reduce your monthly mortgage payment. If you\\'re 10 years into a 30-year mortgage, you can refinance the remaining amount to spread those 20 years of payments across 30 years, lowering your monthly payment.Lock in a lower interest rate. Mortgage interest rates have fallen from their 2022 highs, so many homeowners can lower their interest rates by refinancing. If you\\'ve had a mortgage for a while and have made your payments on time, a new lender may be willing to offer you a lower rate than what you\\'re currently paying -- potentially saving you thousands of dollars. Even a small change can make a big difference. For example, you\\'ll pay $23,400 more with a 6.25% rate than a 6% one on a $400,000 30-year mortgage over the term of the loan.Convert an adjustable-rate mortgage (or ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage. Adjustable-rate mortgages are interest-rate sensitive, so they can start to get pretty expensive as interest rates increase. A refinance is a great opportunity to lock in a fixed-rate mortgage for the remainder of your home loan, and can be an especially good idea when interest rates fall. For more on refinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, check out our guide.Tap home equity to pay for a large project (like an addition or a remodel). While a refinance isn\\'t the only way to get funds for a home improvement project, it means you aren\\'t paying service on extra debt (unlike, say, with a home equity line of credit or a second mortgage) -- instead, you\\'re just converting some of your equity to cash. This is known as a cash-out refi.Make sure you\\'re refinancing with one of the best refinancing lenders not just because you can, but because you need it to achieve your financial goals.Note: If you would like to learn about some of the major players in the mortgage industry, check out The Ascent\\'s research piece on the largest mortgage lenders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the risks of refinancing?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe main risk of refinancing is that it won\\'t be as worthwhile as you think. We\\'ll get into this a bit more in the next section, but a lower interest rate on your mortgage only makes sense if it saves you money relative to the cost of the loan itself.It can also be risky if you\\'re refinancing from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate loan, or vice versa. For example, let\\'s say you have a fixed-rate mortgage at 7% and you refinance to an adjustable-rate mortgage that has a 5% interest rate for five years, but then adjusts annually after that. If market interest rates spike, you can end up paying significantly more interest over time than you would if you had simply kept your existing mortgage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a good refinance rate?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe short answer is it depends. Your refinancing rate depends on market conditions, your FICO\\\\u00ae Score, and the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio of your home. When refinancing with the best refinance companies, your goal should be to get an interest rate that is in line with or better than the current market average for people with a similar credit score.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much could you save by refinancing?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCurrent Monthly Payment\\\\n{{ result.monthly_current_error }} \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCurrent Loan Balance\\\\n{{ result.current_balance_error }} \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTime Remaining On Loan (Years)\\\\n{{ result.years_remaining_error }} \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRefi Mortgage Term (Years)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n30 years\\\\n20 years\\\\n15 years\\\\n10 years\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRefi Interest Rate\\\\n{{ result.refi_interest_rate_error }} \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n{{ calcResult }}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFill out the inputs to see how much you can save in total and in monthly payments with a refinance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n{{ result.msg_monthly_payment }}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$ {{ result.monthlySavings.toString().replace(\\'-\\',\\'\\') }} \\\\/ Month\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe new monthly payment would be:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$ {{ result.newMonthlyDisplay }}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n{{ result.msg1_total }}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$ {{ result.totalSavingsDisplay.replace(\\\\\"-\\\\\",\\\\\"\\\\\") }} \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n{{ result.msg2_total }}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShould you refinance?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRefinancing isn\\'t right for everyone, so it depends on your situation. It largely depends on how much it costs to refinance and how long you plan to stay in your home.One common misconception is that refinancing is free or that it costs the same with every lender. And this isn\\'t the case at all -- borrowers should expect closing costs in the thousands when refinancing. To be sure, this can still be well worth it if you\\'re planning to stay in your home long enough so that the savings outweigh the cost.Here\\'s an example. Let\\'s say that you can lower your monthly mortgage payment by $50 if you refinance, but it will cost you $2,000 in various fees to get the loan. Dividing $2,000 by $50 shows that you would need to stay in the home for at least 40 months for refinancing to be worthwhile.To determine if refinancing is the right decision for you, check out our guide on whether or not refinancing is worth it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLender\\\\nBest For\\\\nNext Steps\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n 2023 Award Winner\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBetter\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4.5 stars\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

You want to refinance if you expect to save more from lower interest payments than the fees you pay for the refinancing. This requires you to estimate how long you will stay in your home. If you plan to move soon, then you won\\'t be paying lower interest for long, so you won\\'t offset the refinancing fees. But if you plan to stay in your house for a long time, then you will save more in interest over time than you pay for the refinancing. There are free refinance calculators on the web that can help you figure out how long it will take to offset the refinancing fee.A second reason to refinance is if your income has increased and you can afford a larger payment. If so, you might benefit from refinancing from a longer-term mortgage (say, 30 years) to a shorter-term mortgage (say, 10 years). With the shorter-term mortgage, you have higher payments, but the interest that you pay over the life of the loan will be much lower.A third reason is that your credit-worthiness has improved. This can happen if your credit score improves, your income dramatically increases, or your home increases substantially in value. You can lower your rate substantially and get better terms in these scenarios.How often should someone refinance their mortgage?It depends on interest rates. There\\'s usually no reason to refinance when interest rates are rising. But if they are falling, as they generally have since 2007, it might make sense to refinance every three or four years, depending on the size of your loan and its time to maturity. You need to check the calculators to see how much you can save and then determine if you will remain in your home long enough to offset the refinancing fees.A pitfall that is easy to overlook is that you can unwittingly end up paying far more interest if you continually refinance mortgages, even though you\\'ve lowered monthly payments. Consider someone who refinances his or her mortgage every three years and gets a new 30-year mortgage each time. After the third refinancing, that person has much lower payments. But that person also has 30 years left on the mortgage and could end up taking 39 years to be free of debt on their house. The extra nine years of payments mean nine more years of interest. At some point, the borrower should pay more than the minimum monthly payments -- to speed the retirement of the debt and reduce total interest payments -- or refinance into a short-term mortgage.What are some tips for people wondering how to refinance their mortgage?It\\'s very easy to apply for a refinance. Many lenders have easy web-based refinancing sites. You should certainly obtain multiple quotes. Check out the big national lenders, but also check out local lenders and the bank or credit union at which you have a checking account. They may give you a better deal if you are an existing customer. Make use of calculators to help you compare rates and to study the impact of \\\\\"points\\\\\" on your overall costs.Before applying to refinance, take advantage of your guaranteed-by-law free credit report to make sure your credit history is accurate. Your credit score plays an important role in determining your interest rate.In addition, mortgage lenders often encourage refinancing customers to borrow to pay their refinancing fee. Be careful. This adds to your overall debt burden and increases the interest you will pay over the life of the loan. Ideally, you will pay the refinance fee from your savings so you don\\'t increase the principal on your mortgage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMichael Manahan\\\\n\\\\nLecturer at California State University Dominguez Hills, Author and Consultant\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen should someone consider refinancing their mortgage?The simple answer is whenever the savings in interest rates reasonably offset the closing costs of a new mortgage. However, there are other reasons to refinance even if you cannot get a better interest rate. If you have a variable rate on your mortgage, your mortgage payment may go up if interest rates rise. Refinancing with a fixed-rate mortgage will eliminate this risk. If you have paid off some of your mortgage, refinancing should reduce your monthly payment and leave more cash for vacations or living expenses. This option is a good option for someone whose income is not expected to increase (people living on some sort of fixed income). Finally, if you have equity in your home, you could refinance and take out cash for home improvements or investments, such as buying a rental property.How often should someone refinance their mortgage?You should refinance your mortgage when rates fall below the rate you are paying, but what if rates keep falling? Should you keep refinancing? That is not an easy question to answer because when you refinance you may get a better interest rate, but refinancing costs money. There are appraisal fees, closing costs, title fees, escrow fees, and sometimes points. All these charges can add up to thousands of dollars. Also, when you refinance there is a good chance your credit score will drop, as \\\\\"new credit\\\\\" and \\\\\"credit inquiries\\\\\" are two things that negatively affect your credit score. If you need credit for anything else, such as a car loan, bathroom or kitchen remodel, or anything else that is paid with consumer credit, you may find you will be charged a higher rate of interest on those loans. Also, when you do refinance the underwriter wants to see your previous loan \\\\\"seasoned\\\\\" which means you have made the payments on time for a certain period. Depending on the underwriter, that could be anywhere from six to 12 months. If you apply to refinance too soon, you may not get as good of an interest rate as you hoped.What are some tips for people wondering how to refinance their mortgage?I have refinanced properties with dozens of lenders and mortgage brokers over the years. I\\'d love to tell you there is some secret to make applying for and getting a mortgage easier. If there is, I haven\\'t found it. But to the degree you can make it a little easier, there are some things you can do. First, have your paperwork ready. The lender is going to want tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements, 401(k) account statements, mortgage statements, brokerage account statements, and possibly more. Download electronic copies of all these documents so when asked, you can quickly upload them or email them to the lender. Second, check your credit report. The lender will want you to explain any negative aspect of your credit report and any credit inquiry that has been made recently. Third, when choosing to use a lender or mortgage broker, don\\'t be fooled by all the low interest rate ads. The interest rate you are going to pay is based on the underwriter\\'s assessment of your risk. I have an excellent credit score, excellent credit history, low amount of debt, good income, and reasonably high net worth. Yet I\\'ve never been able to get those rates they advertise. Finally, think about your style. Are you okay doing everything online and talking to whoever in the call center answers the phone or do you want a specific person handling your transaction whom you can reach out to with questions or to help you through the process?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClifford Rossi\\\\n\\\\nExecutive-in-Residence and Professor of the Practice at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen should someone consider refinancing their mortgage?You should keep an eye on the level and possible direction of interest rates over time and compare that with the rate on your existing mortgage to see if there\\'s a benefit from refinancing. Technically, when prevailing rates fall below your existing mortgage rate you may have an opportunity to effectively swap out your old mortgage with a new one at a lower rate. We call that a rate-and-term refinance. But you need to be mindful of the overall cost of refinancing to ensure you are truly getting an all-in lower rate. Specifically, pay attention to how many points and fees you are being asked to pay upfront if any, as that can reduce the benefit you\\'ll get from just the lower rate.You may also find that in some cases refinancing for a home renovation project might be a good idea if you have experienced a significant increase in the equity stake of your home which many homeowners have seen in the recent run up in home prices. We call this a cash-out refinance. That is, you can replace your existing home mortgage with a new one and actually take cash out of the property for improvements and the like. But these cash-out refinances can be risky so make sure to understand what the impact on your new mortgage payment and payment terms are before taking out such a refinance option.Lastly, these days there\\'s a better than ever chance that interest rates will rise than fall going forward so borrowers that currently have very low adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) may want to consider switching out at some point into a fixed-rate loan if they believe they will be in the home for some time in order to lock in a relatively low mortgage rate now as a hedge against potential future rate increases.How often should someone refinance their mortgage?It really depends on things like market conditions. For example, many years ago, mortgage rates were in a period of steady decline such that I had friends going through multiple refinances in a single year as many lenders were offering no-closing-cost refinances which meant that the borrower did not incur any costs for the new loan. Even when rates fell by as little as 25 basis points (0.25%) under those circumstances borrowers were incentivized to refinance. With more lenders offering electronic loan applications, the process to apply for a loan refinance has become more efficient, thus providing borrowers with potentially greater opportunities to act when rate conditions are favorable. Overall, there are no rules on how often one can refinance and certainly as long as the borrower continues to pay the mortgage as agreed it should not detrimentally affect their credit profile for a standard rate-and-term refinance.What are some tips for people wondering how to refinance their mortgage?The internet has substantially changed things for the better for borrowers compared to years ago. Now you can go to any of several websites that provide current mortgage rates, including Freddie Mac\\'s Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS), to get a sense of where mortgage rates for various products are. Once you determine whether current rates are lower than the rate you have now, then shop around with several lenders to see what you can get in terms of both rate and fees they will charge. Pay particular attention to those fees and points and make sure you get in writing exactly what the new loan terms and costs will be. Lenders must provide that to you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBrian Adams\\\\n\\\\nAssociate Dean of Graduate Programs, Pamplin School of Business at the University of Portland\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen should someone consider refinancing their mortgage?Refinancing makes sense when the reduction in monthly mortgage payment (due to lower interest rates) is greater than the cost of refinancing the loan. The important variable here is the length of time you expect to remain in the home. Usually you would need to stay in the home for at least another three to five years for the reduction in loan payments to offset the refi fees.Refinancing may also make sense if the homeowner can use the accrued equity in the house to reinvest in the house for maintenance and upgrades. Usually kitchen and bathroom remodels will add value to the home for the current homeowners when they sell.How often should someone refinance their mortgage?How often someone should refinance is up to them.

Keeping that in mind, we take our ratings and picks very seriously. While it\\\\u2019s impossible for us to rate and review every offer on the market, we canvas as far as we can. Our five-star rating system takes into account how competitive rates and fees are for a certain lender, the online experience and customer support, as well as how versatile a loan is including repayment terms, availability, downpayment options, and more.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat types of loans are available for first-time home buyers?Many first-time home buyers don\\'t have excellent credit histories, and many others don\\'t have large down payments available. Some have served in the Armed Forces and can access VA loans, while others might be able to explore USDA financing if their homes are in certain rural areas.With that in mind, here\\'s a quick overview of the four major mortgage types first-time home buyers can use.Conventional mortgagesThe majority of purchase mortgage loans in the United States are known as conventional loans. This is a broad term that refers to loans that aren\\'t guaranteed by a government agency. The lack of a guarantee means that conventional mortgages generally have stricter qualification requirements than the other loan types listed here. But they could still be excellent options for first-time buyers with strong credit scores. There are several conventional mortgage programs for first-time buyers that allow for down payments as low as 3% of the purchase price.FIND OUT MORE: Guide to Buying Your First HomeFHA loansFHA mortgage loans are guaranteed, or insured, by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Because of this guarantee, credit requirements are generally looser than other types of mortgages, and down payments can be as low as 3.5%, even with a relatively low credit score. What\\'s more, most closing costs can be rolled into the loan, further reducing your out-of-pocket cash requirement. While there are a few drawbacks to FHA loans, especially when it comes to costs, they can be a great way for buyers who don\\'t have stellar qualifications to become homeowners.Compare lenders: Best FHA LendersCompare rates: Today\\'s FHA Mortgage RatesVA loansA VA loan is a mortgage that is backed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and these are available to certain military members, both past and present. VA loans have no down payment requirement, low interest rates, and flexible credit qualifications, and are generally designed to help qualified veterans purchase a property, so they are definitely worth looking into if you qualify.Compare lenders: Best VA Loan LendersCompare rates: Today\\'s VA Loan RatesUSDA loansA USDA loan is a mortgage that is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. To qualify, a home must be in an eligible rural area, and the borrower\\'s income must be below certain limits. If both borrower and property qualify, USDA loans don\\'t require any down payment whatsoever.It\\'s also important to mention that in addition to these types of loans, many lenders have their own proprietary mortgage products, and some are specifically designed for first-time home buyers. For example, some lenders offer low-down-payment conventional loans with no mortgage insurance requirement. So it could also be a great idea to research the options offered by some of the best mortgage lenders as well as your local and regional financial institutions.Compare lenders: Best USDA Mortgage Lenders\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I qualify as a first-time home buyer?There aren\\'t any specific requirements that only apply to first-time buyers (unless a particular loan product has a separate credit or down payment requirement for first-timers). For the most part, first-time buyers are subject to the same general requirements that all mortgage applicants face.Having said that, first-time buyers are less likely to know what to expect than seasoned homeowners. So here are the general categories of information your mortgage lender will consider when you apply for a mortgage for your first home.CreditBefore verifying any of your other qualifications, lenders will typically run a credit check. Virtually all mortgage lenders use the FICO credit scoring model, and most will pull your scores from all three major credit bureaus and use the middle number for qualification purposes. Federal Housing Administration (or FHA) loans require a minimum 580 FICO\\\\u00ae Score for a 3.5% down payment, while conventional loans have a minimum of 620.Down paymentUnless you\\'re using a VA or USDA loan to finance your home, you\\'ll need a down payment. FHA and conventional loans have low down payment options, and funds can usually come from a gift. But you\\'ll need to document what funds you have for your down payment and where they came from, as well as how you plan to pay for any closing costs.Debt-to-income ratioSimply put, lenders want to make sure you\\'ll be able to afford your mortgage payments, so they\\'ll look at your debt obligations as a percentage of your income, a metric known as your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI ratio. Methods of calculating DTI and lending standards can vary, but a good rule of thumb is that your total monthly debt obligations (including your new mortgage payment) should be no more than 45% of your pre-tax income. However, there are exceptions, and borrowers have different costs of living to deal with, so if you feel you can comfortably afford to have a higher DTI ratio, don\\'t be discouraged. In fact, FHA lenders will allow you to have a DTI as high as 57% in some cases!EmploymentLenders want to know that not only can you afford your mortgage payments for now, but that you\\'ll also be able to keep paying your mortgage year after year. Most mortgage lenders want to see at least two years of steady employment in the same field (but not necessarily with the same employer). There are exceptions, however -- such as if you graduated from college less than two years ago.Assets\\\\/reservesDepending on the mortgage loan you select, as well as your other qualifications, your lender is likely to require a certain amount of money in reserves. This can be as little as two months\\' worth of mortgage payments. The point is that you typically can\\'t end up with a zero balance in your bank account after closing on your home and paying any closing costs.Before you apply for a mortgage, it makes sense to ensure each of these are as good as possible. For example, taking some time to raise your credit score and save a higher down payment could help you snag a better interest rate, which will save you money in the long run.Choosing the best lender for first-time home buyersThe first step in choosing the best mortgage lender for your first home purchase is to get a good understanding of how home loans work. Then you\\'ll need to narrow down a short list of a few (say, three or four) lenders with products and resources that meet your needs and that have strong customer service. Our best first-time mortgage lender list on this page is a good place to start, but it could also be a smart idea to check out your local and regional banks or credit unions so that you can compare mortgage rates. If you\\'re looking for a digital application process, be sure to check out our list of the best online mortgage lenders.Once you have a short list, apply for a mortgage with all of them to compare the specific loan terms and fees that you get offered. It won\\'t hurt your credit score to do this, as all mortgage-based credit inquiries that take place within a typical shopping period are counted as just a single inquiry. You\\'ll see a range of interest rates, fees, and APRs from different lenders, and you\\'d be surprised at how much this can save or cost you over the life of a 30-year mortgage loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFirst-time home buyer resources9 First-Time Home Buyer TipsFirst-Time Home Buyer Benefits: Qualification and Requirements9 First-Time Home Buyer Mistakes to AvoidA First-Time Home Buyer\\\\u2019s Guide to FHA LoansFirst-Time Home-Buyer Class: What to Know and Do You Need to Take One?How to Create a First-Time Homeowners\\\\u2019 BudgetDown Payment Assistance: Available Programs & How to ApplyHow to Shop for a MortgageHome Buyer Checklist: Everything to Do to Buy a Home\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLender\\\\nBest For\\\\nNext Steps\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n 2023 Award Winner\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBetter\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRating image, 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4.5 stars\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOur ratings are based on a 5 star scale.\\\\n5 stars equals Best.\\\\n4 stars equals Excellent.\\\\n3 stars equals Good.\\\\n2 stars equals Fair.\\\\n1 star equals Poor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe want your money to work harder for you.

Look for the most competitive rates, loan terms, down payment requirements, and fees. Buyers should also look to see what types of loans a lender offers, who they will be working with, the average loan processing time, and customer service ratings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat programs are available for first-time home buyers?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFirst-time home buyers can get loans through different programs. The federal government offers low down payment loans through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Veteran Affairs (VA), and The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). First-time home buyers can also get a low down payment conventional loan through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In addition, many states and local governments offer first-time home buyers loans. Non-profit organizations, certain employers, and other financial institutions also offer first-time home buyer loans.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat type of loan can I get as a first-time home buyer?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere are many different types of loans you can get as a first-time home buyer. There are loans to assist with the down payment, down payment assistance (DPA) grants, government-backed loans, conventional loans offered through financial institutions, as well as loans through charities, non-profits, and employer-sponsored loans.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are the best loans for first-time home buyers?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt depends on the buyer, but if you don\\'t have a large down payment or you don\\'t have an established credit history, a FHA loan could be the best way to get into your first home. FHA loans require just 3.5% down for borrowers with credit scores of 580 or higher, and have lower credit scoring requirements than any other major home loan type.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow much money do I have to put down as a first-time home buyer?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDepending on your circumstances, you might be able to get a loan for your first home with little or no money down. USDA and VA loans both have no down payment requirement, and some banks offer their own first-time buyer loans with 0% down. FHA loans require 3.5% down for most borrowers, and it\\'s possible for first-time buyers to get a conventional mortgage with as little as 3% down.Having said that, a higher down payment can reduce your monthly mortgage payments and, depending on your loan type can either reduce or eliminate your private mortgage insurance expense.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the easiest loan for first-time buyers to get approved for?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor most buyers, an FHA loan is the easiest to get approved for. Borrowers with 10% down payments can get approved with credit scores as low as 500, and the down payment requirement drops to 3.5% for borrowers with FICO\\\\u00ae Scores of 580 or higher. These are the lowest credit scoring requirements for the major types of mortgages. On the other hand, if you have a high credit score or have served in the Armed Forces, a conventional or VA loan can be just as \\\\\"easy\\\\\" to get.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Matt Frankel, CFP\\\\u00ae\\\\nOur Mortgages Expert\",\"Article Date\":\"August 17, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Best FHA Lenders of October 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/mortgages\\\\/best-lenders-fha-loans\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

These mortgage loans have lower barriers to entry and can help you finance a home even if you don\\'t have a high credit score or large down payment. Because the requirements aren\\'t as strict as conventional mortgages, these loans are perfect for first-time home buyers or those with poor credit.FHA mortgages come in two different types:\\\\u00a0FHA 203(b) loan: This is the \\\\\"standard\\\\\" FHA loan. It\\'s designed for buying a home that is essentially move-in ready.FHA 203(k) loan: This is an FHA mortgage loan designed for purchasing homes that need significant repairs or renovations before move-in. Many of the best FHA 203(k) lenders will let you roll these costs into a monthly mortgage payment with a competitive interest rate.\\\\u00a0One of the most important points to know about FHA loans is that they are meant only for owner-occupied properties. You can\\'t use an FHA loan to buy a vacation home, rental, or investment property.Learn more: FHA vs. Conventional Loan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do FHA loans work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAn FHA mortgage is a private home loan insured by the government. Because the loan amount is backed by the FHA, lenders are more willing to take on high-risk borrowers.That said, FHA does have some requirements, such as:\\\\u00a0Down payment of at least 3.5%Credit score of at least 580 (or 500 if your down payment is 10% or more)\\\\u00a0Debt-to-income ratio of at most 43%\\\\u00a0Loan must be for an owner-occupied property\\\\u00a0Two years of stable income and explanations for any gaps in employment history\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0Safe, sound, and secure propertyLet\\'s take a look at each of these in more detail.Down paymentYou need 3.5% of the purchase price as a down payment to qualify for an FHA mortgage loan (or 10% if your credit score is between 500 and 579).\\\\u00a0 That means for every $100,000 you plan to spend on a home, you should have $3,500 to put toward a down payment.Credit scoreIn general, the minimum credit score to qualify for an FHA loan is 580. But many of the best\\\\u00a0 FHA lenders for bad credit may allow a score as low as 500 if you can afford a down payment of 10% or more. For comparison, conventional mortgage lenders typically require credit scores of 620 or higher.\\\\u00a0Debts and incomeGenerally speaking, many of the best FHA loan lenders look for a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of at most 43%. That means, your total monthly debt obligations (including your proposed monthly mortgage payment) should be less than 43% of your pre-tax monthly income. For example, if you\\'re bringing in $5,000 per month (before taxes), your mortgage payment should be no more than $2,150.\\\\u00a0That said, if you have certain \\\\\"compensating factors,\\\\\" such as a high credit score or a hefty amount of savings, lenders may issue loans for higher DTI ratios.\\\\u00a0Employment historyTop FHA lenders typically want to see at least two years of steady employment. That doesn\\'t mean you have to stay with the same employer for two years, nor does it require you to stay within the same line of work. As long as a lender can verify that you have two years of steady work history, you can check this box.\\\\u00a0That said, you may still qualify if you have gaps in your work history. Typically, you just need to provide your FHA lender with a letter explaining any gaps that span a month or longer. For instance, if you graduated from college last year and have been steadily employed since then, you could still potentially qualify. Lenders just want to know that your income is likely to continue for years to come.Property standardsFHA loans can be used to purchase single-family homes, condominiums, and even multi-family properties with as many as four housing units. As long as the buyer plans to live in one of the units, the property qualifies.The home must also meet standards set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). While HUD has some specific requirements, the department just wants the home to be safe, sound, and secure, which generally means free of any hazards that could adversely affect occupants. To ensure the home meets HUD\\'s requirements, an appraiser approved by the FHA must inspect the property.If the home needs major renovations or repairs before you move in, then you\\'ll need to apply for a FHA 203(k) loan. The standard FHA loan -- 203(b) -- doesn\\'t usually cover homes that need major work.\\\\u00a0READ MORE: If you would like to learn about some of the major players in the mortgage industry, check out The Ascent\\'s research piece on the largest mortgage lenders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre there extra costs with an FHA loan?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes, FHA loans come with costs above what you\\'ll pay on the mortgage. Perhaps the most significant is the FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP), which is broken down into two types: upfront and annual.\\\\u00a0The upfront MIP is 1.75% of the loan amount. For example, if you buy a $300,000 home and put 3.5% down, your base loan amount is $289,500. The upfront MIP on this loan amount would be 1.75% of $289,500, or $5,066.25. This amount is paid only once and can be rolled into your FHA loan.\\\\u00a0The annual MIP is a bit more complicated to calculate. It depends on the loan length, amount, and down payment. For most 15-year FHA loans, it ranges from 0.15% to 0.40% per year. For 30-year FHA loans, it\\'s in the 0.50% to 0.55% range.\\\\u00a0If your down payment is less than 10%, you\\'ll pay annual MIPs for the entire length of your FHA loan. This is different from private mortgage insurance (PMI) on conventional loans, which can be canceled when the loan-to-value ratio drops below 80%. For those FHA borrowers who can put down 10% or more, annual MIPs can be dropped after 11 years for both 15- and 30-year loan terms.\\\\u00a0In addition to mortgage insurance, FHA loans have closing costs, which may include:Your lender\\'s origination feePrepaid taxes and insuranceDiscount pointsAppraisal feesThe FHA mortgage insurance premiumIf you\\'re working with one of the best lenders for FHA mortgages, your lender should be glad to answer any questions about closing costs associated with your mortgage. Still, there are ways you can potentially lower your out-of-pocket costs, such as:\\\\u00a0Gift money. The down payment doesn\\'t necessarily need to be your money. All or part of your down payment can come from a down payment gift. This could help lower your monthly expenses and eventually cancel your annual MIP.\\\\u00a0Roll in closing costs. Many FHA lenders will let you roll closing costs into the FHA loan itself, freeing your money up for other things, such as putting down a bigger down payment.\\\\u00a0Likewise, if you need to renovate a home, the best 203(k) loan lenders will let you roll those costs into your monthly mortgage.Seller concessions. You can ask the seller to pay some or all of your closing costs (as much as 6% of the purchase price) as part of your purchase offer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTIP\\\\n\\\\nHow much will my monthly mortgage payment be?\\\\n\\\\nUse our mortgage calculator to help you estimate your monthly mortgage payments using various loan terms, insurances, and taxes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs there an income limit for FHA loans?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNo, you don\\'t need a minimum or maximum income to qualify for an FHA loan. But there are FHA loan limits -- that is, a maximum amount you can borrow.\\\\u00a0In 2023, the standard FHA loan limit for a one-unit property is $472,030 for most U.S. housing markets, while certain high-cost areas could have limits as high as $1,089,300 . These figures are based on the national limit for conforming mortgages, which is currently $726,200. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sets the \\\\\"floor\\\\\" at 65% and the \\\\\"ceiling\\\\\" at 150%. Again, the current floor is 65% of $726,200 (or $472,030) and the ceiling is 150% of that figure, or $1,089,300.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0FHA loans can be made in higher amounts for a duplex, because there are more units involved.

Then, compare mortgage rates, terms, and fees.Mortgage ratesEach FHA mortgage company sets its own rate for the sum you borrow. Even a small difference in interest rate from one lender to another could result in big savings over the life of your repayment period, especially if you end up with a 30-year mortgage.TermsYou may want to take out a 30-year mortgage, or you may want to pay off your home in 15 years. The FHA mortgage lender you choose should be able to offer a loan term with a repayment period that works for you.FeesWhen you sign a mortgage, you pay closing costs to finalize that loan. Those fees vary from lender to lender. It\\'s common for closing costs to amount to 2% to 6% of your loan amount. But since that\\'s a big range, it may be that one FHA lender offers substantially lower closing costs than another.Most big lenders offer FHA loans, especially those focused on helping borrowers with poor credit. Our picks for the best FHA mortgage lenders (at the top of this page) are a good place to start.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt pays to shop around\\\\n\\\\nComparing interest rates from different lenders is the best way to get the most competitive rate. Check out today\\'s FHA mortgage rates to get started!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompare FHA mortgage rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs an FHA loan right for me?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re looking to get a mortgage with poor credit or without a large down payment, an FHA loan could be a smart option. Use our list above as a starting point to find the best FHA lenders for bad credit.But if your credit score is above 580 or you have a relatively large down payment, you\\'ll probably save money with a conventional mortgage.For example, if your down payment is 20% of the purchase price on a conventional loan, you can avoid paying mortgage insurance altogether. With an FHA loan, however, you would still pay annual MIP for 11 years. Even if you don\\'t have a large down payment, borrowers with excellent credit scores might still get conventional mortgages with down payments as low as 3%. Plus, you\\'ll find better mortgage insurance terms than with even the best lenders for FHA loans. If that\\'s your situation, get started with our list of this month\\'s best mortgage lenders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDo all lenders work with FHA loans?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFor lenders to offer FHA loans, they must be approved by the Federal Housing Administration, which backs those loans.

FHA loans are made by private mortgage lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and specialized mortgage lenders, and are guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDo FHA loans require insurance?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFHAs require two types of mortgage insurance premiums (MIP): annual and upfront. They don\\'t, however, require private mortgage insurance (PMI).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs there a required credit score for an FHA loan?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYes, the minimum FICO\\\\u00ae Score required for an FHA loan is 580. For down payments above 10%, the minimum credit score is 500.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the best bank for an FHA loan?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe best bank for FHA loans is one that offers you a competitive mortgage rate and will pre-approve you even if your credit score isn\\'t flawless. Many national banks have FHA mortgage programs, but you can check out credit unions to compare rates.\\\\u00a0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs an FHA lender the same as an FHA mortgage broker?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNo, they\\'re not the same. An FHA lender is someone who will issue you an FHA loan, whereas an FHA mortgage broker is an intermediary who will connect you with FHA lenders or FHA mortgage companies. Brokers can help you find good FHA loan rates, but they won\\'t lend you money themselves.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Maurie Backman\\\\n and\\\\u00a0Steven Porrello\\\\nOur Mortgages Experts\",\"Article Date\":\"September 22, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Content not found\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/mortgages\\\\/rates\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"This device is too small\\\\nIf you\\'re on a Galaxy Fold, consider unfolding your phone or viewing it in full screen to best optimize your experience.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0Kimberly Rotter\\\\nOur Mortgages Expert\",\"Article Date\":\"March 20, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How Credit Cards Work: A Beginner\\'s Guide\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/credit-cards\\\\/how-credit-cards-work-beginners-guide\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

There\\'s a lot to learn when you start using credit cards, and a lack of knowledge can end up costing you money.This beginner\\'s guide will cover all the credit card basics. You\\'ll learn exactly how credit cards work, how to choose the best first credit card, and plenty of other information you\\'ll need to know about using credit cards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJump To\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do credit cards work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat to look for with your first credit card\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecommended credit cards for beginners\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs a credit card necessary?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do credit cards work?A credit card is tied to a credit account with a financial institution. When you use the card, you\\'re borrowing money from the credit card issuer. You can use a credit card to purchase goods or services with any merchant that accepts credit cards. Some cards also let you get a cash advance, although this isn\\'t recommended because of the high fees involved.The amount you owe on a credit card is called the balance. If you make a $100 purchase, your card\\'s balance would increase by $100.Each credit card has a credit limit, which is the maximum amount you can owe the bank at one time. For example, if your card\\'s credit limit is $1,000, then the balance can\\'t exceed that amount.LEARN MORE: What Is the Average Credit Card Limit?The difference between your credit limit and your balance is known as your available credit. Continuing the example above, if your card has a $1,000 credit limit and a $100 balance, the available credit would be $900.After you make a payment, you have more available credit to borrow again. For that reason, a credit card is considered a revolving line of credit. You can keep using it and borrowing from it, as long as you pay your bill and have credit available.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n;\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is APR?APR, which stands for annual percentage rate, is the annual cost of borrowing money with a credit card. It\\'s the interest rate the card issuer charges on any outstanding balance after your payment due date.Fortunately, you can avoid interest charges by paying off your card\\'s full statement balance. If you do that, you won\\'t need to pay any interest on purchases you make.LEARN MORE: What Is APR and What Does It Mean for Your Credit Cards?Here\\'s an example of how APR works:Your credit card has an APR of 20%.You have a balance of $1,000.If you leave that balance on the card and don\\'t incur any fees, then it would grow to $1,200 after one year. (20% of $1,000 = $200, added to the amount you owed originally)If you pay off the full $1,000 balance by the due date, there won\\'t be any interest charges.In reality, you couldn\\'t leave that balance for a whole year. You\\'d need to make minimum payments every month to keep your account in good standing and avoid fees. That was just an example to explain the concept of credit card interest.LEARN MORE: How Does Credit Card Interest Work?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to build creditAfter you\\'re approved for a credit card, it\\'s important to use the card in a way that will improve your credit score. Here\\'s what you need to do to build credit with a credit card.Pay on timeThe best thing you can do for your credit is to always pay on time. Your payment history is the most significant factor in determining your credit score, and on-time payments will help you get excellent credit.Most credit card issuers offer an autopay feature. This is a good way to ensure you never miss a payment. Alternatively, you can set a monthly reminder for yourself.Watch your FICO\\\\u00ae ScoreAlthough there are multiple types of credit scores, the FICO\\\\u00ae Score is the one that lenders use most often. You should check yours at least once every few months to ensure you\\'re headed in the right direction. Some credit cards include a FICO\\\\u00ae Score tracker, but if yours doesn\\'t, there are also free ways to check your score online.LEARN MORE: How to Find Out Your Credit ScoreKeep your balances lowIt\\'s bad for your credit score if your credit card balance gets too high. Try to always stay below 30% of your credit limit to avoid a drop in your credit score. You can calculate this by multiplying your card\\'s credit limit by 30%. For example, if your card has a $1,000 credit limit, aim to keep the balance below $300.LEARN MORE: How Much Available Credit Should I Have?Ask for a credit limit increaseAfter nine to 12 months of using your card and making on-time payments, ask the card issuer for a credit limit increase. A higher credit limit can make it easier to keep your balances below the recommended 30% ratio.LEARN MORE: How to Increase Your Credit LimitKeep your account openOne factor that affects your credit score is your average account age. It\\'s recommended to keep older accounts around to help boost your credit score. Try not to close your first credit card, in particular, since that will be your oldest credit account.LEARN MORE: Should You Close an Unused Credit Card?Apply for new cards sparinglyAs you build your credit, you\\'ll start to become eligible for credit cards with more benefits. There\\'s nothing wrong with opening a new card that could save you money, but be careful not to overdo it.Each time you apply for a credit card, it has a small impact on your credit score. Too many applications can make it difficult to continue improving your credit. Apply for a new card once every year or once every six months at most so your credit score keeps going up.LEARN MORE: Does Applying for a Credit Card Hurt Your Credit Score?What should I look for in a first credit card?Beginner credit cards usually come with features or perks that are designed for new users. Here are a few features to look for when choosing the best first credit card.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNo annual feeIdeally, your first credit card is one that you\\'ll want to keep open forever, helping you extend the age of your credit history with each passing month. We think the best first credit card is one that doesn\\'t have an annual fee, so you won\\'t have to pay every year just to keep it open.LEARN MORE: Best No Annual Fee Credit CardsFree FICO\\\\u00ae Score trackerSome credit cards offer free access to your FICO\\\\u00ae Score. This allows you to keep an eye on your score from your online credit card account.No or low security depositSecured credit cards are popular for those who are new to credit. To get this type of card, you pay a refundable security deposit. Because the credit card issuer is getting a deposit upfront, it can be more flexible about whom it approves.LEARN MORE: What Is a Secured Credit Card?Secured cards aren\\'t your only option, so it\\'s worth looking at unsecured cards, as well. That way, you may be able to avoid paying a deposit. If you go with a secured card, look for one with an affordable deposit amount. Cards that offer a $200 credit limit in exchange for a deposit of $200 or less are ideal.COMPARE TOP PICKS: Best Secured Credit CardsRewardsRewards aren\\'t a make-or-break feature, since the primary purpose of a beginner card is to help you build a credit score and qualify for better terms on loans and cards later. That said, if you can score rewards from your first credit card, it\\'s certainly not a bad feature to have.LEARN MORE: Best Rewards Credit CardsBEGINNER\\'S GUIDE: Are credit cards bad?

A limited credit history can affect your life in many ways. The most obvious is that you\\'ll have trouble getting approved by lenders if you ever want to borrow money. In addition, it can lead to you getting rejected when trying to rent a home, and in many states, it can even result in higher car insurance rates.Security: Credit cards are the best payment method from a security perspective. If a thief makes fraudulent charges with your credit card, you can contact the card issuer to get the charges removed and receive a new card. The most you can legally be liable for with credit card fraud is $50. And most card issuers even have zero-liability policies, which means you won\\'t be liable for fraudulent charges at all.Rewards: Many of the best credit cards offer cash back, travel points, or some other form of rewards. This allows you to earn value back on the money you spend.Credit cards vs. debit cardsSince credit cards and debit cards look alike, it\\'s easy to get them confused. To help you tell them apart, we\\'ll take a closer look at their similarities and differences.SimilaritiesCredit cards and debit cards are both physical cards that are tied to a financial account. You can use each type of card to pay for goods or services. The ways you use them for transactions are also the same. For physical transactions, the most common option is to insert your card, swipe it in a card reader, or make a contactless payment. For online transactions, you enter your card information.DifferencesAlthough both types of cards are tied to financial accounts, the accounts they are tied to are different. A credit card is tied to a revolving line of credit that a bank has issued you. A debit card is tied to your bank account.This is an important distinction. With a credit card transaction, the card issuer pays, and you pay them back later. With a debit card transaction, you pay using funds from your bank account. If you have a fraudulent charge on your credit card, you can call and have that charge removed, and you won\\'t be out any money. If you\\'re a victim of debit card fraud, the bank may need to investigate before it can put the money back into your account.Because of that difference, it can be easier to deal with credit card fraud. The money never leaves your bank account, like it does with debit card fraud.Credit scoreCredit cards affect your credit score, but debit cards do not. When you use your credit card and pay the bill on time, your credit will improve. Paying by debit card does not benefit your credit score in any way.Secured credit cardsSecured credit cards are a type of credit card that require a security deposit. They\\'re typically chosen by consumers with bad or limited credit histories who can\\'t get approved for unsecured credit cards.Although you need to deposit money to get a secured credit card, it\\'s considered a credit card and not a debit card. You\\'re still borrowing money from the credit card company. The deposit is simply collateral. That also means a secured card can help you improve your credit just like any other credit card.If you want to start building your credit score using a secured credit card, check out our roundup of the best secured credit cards.Important credit card termsCredit card: A physical card that\\'s connected to a credit account. The card can be used to make purchases through that credit account.Unsecured credit card: A credit card that doesn\\'t require any security deposit from the cardholder. Most credit cards are unsecured.Secured credit card: A credit card that requires a security deposit when the cardholder opens the account.Cash advance: Using a credit card to get cash. Cash advances typically have higher APRs and start accruing interest immediately, so they\\'re not recommended.Balance transfer: Transferring a balance from one credit card to another, most often because one card has a lower APR. Not all credit cards offer balance transfers.Credit limit: The maximum balance a credit card can have. Many credit cards have different limits for cash advances. For example, a card could have a credit limit of $10,000, but a cash advance limit of $3,000. That means of the $10,000 credit limit, up to $3,000 could be used for a cash advance.Available credit: The difference between a card\\'s credit limit and its available credit. If you have a $400 balance on a card with a $1,000 credit limit, then its current available credit is $600.Revolving line of credit: A line of credit that you can use and reuse, up to the credit limit, as long as the account is open. When you make payments, it frees up more available credit for you to use again.APR: The annual percentage rate, which is the annual cost of borrowing money.Minimum payment: The minimum amount you need to pay on your credit card by the due date. If you don\\'t pay at least this much, the card issuer can charge you a late fee.Statement balance: The credit card\\'s balance on your most recent statement closing date. By paying this amount in full every billing cycle, you can avoid interest charges on purchases you make.Credit score: A number that rates your creditworthiness, or the likeliness that you\\'ll repay what you borrow.Still have questions?Here are some other questions we\\'ve answered:What Is a Credit Card?How Your Income Affects Credit Card ApplicationsHow to Read Your Credit Card StatementWhat Is a Bank?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChoosing a credit card\\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t you wish you could take a peek inside a credit card expert\\'s wallet sometimes?

But picking the right bank or credit union account can be challenging, especially for those who are new to banking.And what is a bank, even? What is a credit union? How do you compare banks, or know what savings account is the best savings account?This guide can help you understand banks and credit unions, types of bank accounts, what to look for in a bank account, how to compare banks, and how to open a bank account and fund your account.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJump to a section\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a bank?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow to choose a bank\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBank account types\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOpening an account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a bank?\\\\nHow to choose a bank\\\\nBank account types\\\\nOpening an account\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBank vs. credit union vs. online bank\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to choosing a financial institution, the three most common options are banks, credit unions, and online banks. They each offer unique benefits that cater to different needs. Here are the main differences.What is a bank?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDefinition: A bank is an institution where anyone (approved by the bank) can deposit savings and take out loans. Banks are often seen as a convenient and secure way to store money, and some account types also earn interest. Most banks have both online and in-person services.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExamples of banks:Bank of AmericaCapital OneKeyBankTD BankUSAABank pros:FDIC insuranceIn-person customer serviceLarge network of ATM locations and branchesOnline tools and appsMany options for accounts and financial servicesBank cons:Fees are often higher than other financial institutionsLoans often have higher interest ratesLack of flexibility and can limit customers\\' access to moneyDeposit accounts (like savings) don\\'t usually earn much interestBanks are for-profit organizations. At a bank, you can open checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, or other products. Almost anyone can join a bank.However, banks often charge higher fees than credit unions. They also usually offer lower interest rates on checking and savings accounts.Learn more about banksHere are a few lists we\\'ve made to help you compare banks -- whether you\\'re looking for account bonuses, joint accounts, or something else:Best national banksBest banks for joint accountsBest banks for college students\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow More [ + ]\\\\nShow Less [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is an online bank?Definition: An online bank is a financial institution that takes deposits and makes loans online, without any physical branches.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExamples of online banks:AllyAxos BankEverBankQuonticVio BankOnline bank pros:FDIC insuranceConvenience and account access at any time and anywhere.Fees are lowerLoans have lower interest ratesDeposit accounts (like savings) earn more interestOnline bank cons:No in-person customer serviceTaking out cash can be a hassleSecurity concernsOnline banking has become increasingly popular in recent years, allowing customers to manage their finances from the comfort of their own home. Online banks are for-profit. They\\'re similar to other banks, except they don\\'t have any in-person locations. If you need help, you must contact the online bank by phone or email.People generally like these banks because they offer high interest rates on bank accounts and low interest rates on loans. Another advantage of online banking is the convenience it provides. Customers can access their account at any time, anywhere, and complete transactions quickly and easily.The biggest drawback of online banks is that accessing your funds can be more difficult. Some banks have ATM networks where you can withdraw cash for free. However, if you don\\'t live near a connected ATM, it can be a hassle to withdraw cash from an online bank account.It\\'s normal to have a lot of questions about opening an online bank account. Online banks are new, and a lot of people have never opened an account with an online bank before. Here are some resources we\\'ve created to help you decide if an online bank account is for you:Are online banks safe?Pros and cons of online banksWe\\'ve also reviewed many popular online checking accounts, and created a list to help you compare.

Unlike banks, credit unions are owned and operated by their members, with a focus on providing affordable financial products and services.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCredit union pros:NCUA insuranceIn-person customer serviceFees are usually lower than other financial institutionsLoans generally have lower interest ratesDeposit accounts (like savings) usually earn more interestSometimes more lenient towards borrowers with bad creditCredit union cons:Generally fewer online and mobile toolsMembership may be limited to those who qualifyFewer options for accountsNetworks of ATMs and physical branches can be limitedCredit unions are not-for-profit. The biggest advantage of using a credit union is that they typically offer better interest rates on loans, credit cards, savings accounts, and CDs, compared to traditional banks. However, they also tend to have fewer product offerings. Plus, not everyone can become a member of a credit union.Each credit union defines its membership differently. To become a member of a credit union, you might need to pay a small membership fee or be part of an organization (like the military).If you\\'re comparing banks vs. credit unions, an important first question is \\\\\"Can I become a member of the credit union I\\'m interested in joining?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow More [ + ]\\\\nShow Less [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s the best bank?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThat depends on who you are and what you need!For a quick look at the banks we love, click a button below.

Then, ask the following questions. The more times you answer \\\\\"Yes\\\\\" to these questions about a bank you like, the more likely that bank fits your lifestyle:Does it have FDIC or NCUA insurance? This keeps your money safe if the bank or credit union fails.Is it convenient for you? This can mean a good location or a even good mobile app.Does it have good customer service? Look at online reviews, as well as hours for the bank\\'s call center and online chat services.Does it offer other financial products you need, like mortgages or small business accounts?Answering these questions should help you find the right bank for you.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re curious about any of the questions above, keep reading --we\\'ll dig into the details of each one by one below:FDIC insurance or NCUA insuranceWhat is FDIC insurance, you ask? It\\'s a guarantee that the bank will have some or all of your money available for you to withdraw (within account requirements and limitations) -- even if the bank itself fails.You\\'ll probably never need FDIC or NCUA insurance, but if you do, you\\'ll really need it. Make sure that your bank or credit union is FDIC insured before you sign up. Most state their member ID number on the footer of their website. You can also contact the bank or credit union if you\\'re unsure, but most should have the applicable type of insurance.Availability and convenienceTo find the right financial institution for you, check where and how you can access your account. If you prefer banking in person, check whether the bank you\\'re interested in has branches near you (or nationwide, if that fits your lifestyle).Most banks offer some online functionality these days, and some banks are fully online. But it\\'s worth checking out a bank\\'s mobile banking app (if it has one) to see how much of your banking you can do from your phone or other device. This could be especially helpful if you\\'re opening a joint account with someone who doesn\\'t live near you.Customer serviceLook into how you can contact the bank or credit union if you have questions or problems with your account. Check into its customer service hours as well. Some national banks have 24\\\\/7 customer support, while smaller regional banks and credit unions may only operate during normal business hours.Mortgages, loans, and other banking productsYou may only be looking for a checking or savings account now, but in the future you might need to buy a home or start a business and then you\\'ll need a mortgage or a business loan. Anticipating your future needs and choosing a bank or credit union that can accommodate them can prevent you from having to jump ship as your financial needs change.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow More [ + ]\\\\nShow Less [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s the best bank account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnce you\\'ve narrowed your list down to a couple banks, take a look at their accounts and ask the following questions.Would it be free for you to use ATMs? Look for banks with a large ATM network, or accounts that offer ATM fee reimbursement for out-of-network ATMs.Do any accounts have a high interest rate (APY)? This is how much money you\\'ll earn in interest.Do the accounts have low fees? To see all the fees associated with an account, you can ask for something called a \\\\\"fee schedule.\\\\\"Do the accounts have minimum balances you can maintain?Do any of the accounts offer an attractive sign-up bonus?Need a place to start? Here\\'s a few places you can find our favorite bank accounts:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest Savings Accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest Checking Accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKeep reading for more information on how to compare different accounts:ATM network or generous ATM fee reimbursement programYou want your bank to be as accessible as possible. If you often pay with cash, you will need access to in-network ATMs to avoid any ATM fees. If you only have access to out-of-network ATMs, look for banks that offer generous ATM fee reimbursements. Most banks boast how many ATMs you can use for free on their websites, and they\\'ll also post what fees, if any, you might incur when using an ATM.Bank interest ratesLook at the APYs your bank or credit union offers on the type of account you\\'re interested in, and compare this to some of its competitors.Note that some financial institutions employ a tiered system where you earn a higher interest rate for having a larger balance. If this is the case, figure out what kind of interest rate you can realistically expect based on how much you plan to keep in the account.You should also look into how its interest rates on loans stack up against competitors if you think you might ever take out a loan from the bank or credit union.FeesCheck the fee schedule for the type of account you plan to open. Contact the bank or credit union if you are unable to find this information on its website or if you have any questions about its fees. Read through it all carefully and make sure you understand what you\\'re getting into. Common fees to watch for include: monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, out-of-network ATM fees, insufficient funds fees, and more.Minimum balance requirementMany banks and credit unions require a minimum initial deposit to open your account. They may have ongoing minimum balance requirements you must meet to avoid fees. Like almost everything on this list, requirements will vary by institution and account type. Make sure you\\'re comfortable with these before you sign up or you could cost yourself money.Account sign-up bonusesAn increasing number of banks and credit unions are offering special sign-up bonuses like credit cards do to entice new customers. This could be the deciding factor between two similar bank accounts, but don\\'t base your decision on a sign-up bonus alone.If you\\'re interested in accounts with bonuses, head over to our Best Bank Bonuses page.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow More [ + ]\\\\nShow Less [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTypes of bank accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere are four main types of bank accounts: checking accounts, savings accounts, CDs, and MMAs.

On top of making sure any account you choose is FDIC-insured, we recommend asking yourself these three questions when comparing checking accounts:What are the account fees? (Fewer is better)Is there a minimum deposit or balance?Does the account earn interest?These three questions can help you get a better idea of how the checking account will fit into your everyday life.Our recommendations: Checking accounts we loveWe spent some time (okay, a lot of time) looking at what\\'s on the market for checking accounts.

You can also purchase checks for your checking account if you prefer to pay this way.This account differs from other banking accounts in that it generally has lower interest rates, but provides the account holder with more flexibility in terms of accessing funds.While some online checking accounts offer interest, these accounts are rare, and even the best interest-bearing checking accounts usually have annual percentage yields (APYs) lower than most savings account APYs. If you\\'re hoping to grow your money, you\\'re better off using one of the other bank accounts listed below.Some checking accounts charge a monthly maintenance fee, but they might waive this if you meet certain requirements, like having a certain number of deposits per month or maintaining a minimum balance. Other fees you might run into with checking accounts are ATM fees for using ATMs outside of your bank or credit union\\'s network or overdraft fees if you try to withdraw more money from your checking account than it contains.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow More [ + ]\\\\nShow Less [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSavings accountsBest for: Those who want a low-risk way to grow their money.Not for: Those who plan to withdraw money frequently from their account.A savings account is a low-risk account where you can earn interest on your money. It\\'s a great place to save for an emergency fund, a vacation, or a down payment on a home. However, you can only withdraw money from a savings account account a handful of times every month -- so it\\'s not great for paying bills.

There are different types of savings accounts available, each with their own features and benefits.The average savings account APY is 0.42%, but some high-yield savings accounts offer APYs in excess of 5%. A higher APY will help your savings grow more quickly.While you can technically keep the money in your savings account indefinitely, savings accounts are best for money you plan to use in the next three to five years. Invest longer-term savings if you hope to beat inflation and actually increase your wealth over time.A savings account isn\\'t the best choice if you expect to withdraw cash from your accounts often. That\\'s because it\\'s subject to Regulation D. This is a federal law that restricts savings account holders to six \\\\\"convenient\\\\\" withdrawals or transfers per month.READ MORE: What Is Regulation D?Convenient transactions include transfers made online or over the phone, bill payments or other recurring transfers, and overdraft transfers. If you have more than six of these per month, your bank or credit union will charge you extra fees.You can still make additional \\\\\"inconvenient\\\\\" withdrawals, though, including visiting a branch location if your financial institution has them or requesting a mailed check from your bank.This is partly because banks and credit unions take the money you place into your savings account and use it to finance loans for other customers. Then, they give you a portion of the interest they earn from the borrower.Savings accounts don\\'t usually include checks or debit cards for accessing funds. You may need to transfer funds to a checking account before you can withdraw the money via check or debit card payment. You also need to be mindful of the account\\'s minimum balance requirement. If it has one and you let your balance fall below that level, you might incur additional fees.Below are some examples of savings accounts.

MMAs often come with checks or debit cards, like a checking account. They also have high interest rates -- like savings accounts. However, they usually have high minimum balances. You\\'ll have to be able to keep a hefty chunk of cash in the bank at all times if you want to have an MMA.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest Money Market Accounts\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s lots of MMAs on the market.

Here are three things we recommend comparing between money market accounts when looking for one that fits you:What\\'s the interest rate? (Higher is better)What\\'s the minimum balance?What are the fees on the account?Also make sure you look for an account that\\'s FDIC-insured -- that makes sure your money is protected, up to $250,000.Our recommendations: Money market accounts we loveWe spend our days looking at bank accounts (and their close relatives -- credit cards, mortgages, and others).

The average national rate is 0.63%, but in some cases they\\'re in excess of 5%. Money market accounts can be a wise choice if you hope to grow your money more quickly without tying it up in a CD for years at a time. But that\\'s not to say they\\'re without restrictions.Money market accounts are also subject to Regulation D, like savings accounts, so you\\'re limited to six online or phone transfers and withdrawals per month. Checks also count toward your six convenient withdrawals per month, but ATM withdrawals do not. The interest rate on a money market account is variable, which means it can fluctuate over time.If a money market sounds like the right account for you, check out our list of the best money market accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow More [ + ]\\\\nShow Less [ - ]\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCertificates of deposit (CDs)Best for: Those who want to earn a higher interest rate on their savings and don\\'t need to spend that money anytime soon.Not for: Those who think they\\'ll need to withdraw their money before the CD\\'s maturity date.A certificate of deposit (CD), also known as a share certificate if you\\'re using a credit union, is a special type of savings account that offers a higher interest rate -- but there\\'s a catch. When you put the money into a CD, you\\'re agreeing that you won\\'t touch it for the length of the CD term. This can be anywhere from a few months to several years. Usually, the longer the loan term, the higher the interest rate. The best CDs can offer APYs of around 5%.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 6-Month CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 1-Year CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 2-Year CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 3-Year CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 4-Year CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBest 5-Year CD Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen you\\'re looking at CDs, there are a few important factors to keep an eye out for. Picking the right CD is important because you have to commit to it for a period of months or years. You\\'re not married to it, but you\\'re definitely at the \\\\\"moving in together\\\\\" stage of bank accounts.That said, here are the three things we look for when looking at certificates of deposit:What\\'s the interest rate (APY)? (Higher is better)What\\'s the minimum deposit to open the account?What\\'s the term?It\\'s also important to make sure any CD you\\'re considering is FDIC-insured. This ensures your money is protected (up to $250,000) if the bank fails.Our recommendations: CDs we loveIf you know any of us in person, you know we like to talk about finances even when we\\'re not working.

They are ideal for those who have a lump sum of money that they don\\'t need to use immediately, as the longer the term of the CD, the higher the interest rate and return.You can withdraw money from your account before it reaches its maturity date (the end of the CD term), but you\\'ll pay a high penalty. This is often a certain number of months\\' worth of interest, and the farther away you are from your maturity date, the greater the penalty. A few CDs, known as no-penalty CDs, do not charge you if you withdraw your money early, but these usually have lower APYs than other types of CDs.CD laddering is a popular strategy that lets you take advantage of the higher APYs offered by longer-term CDs while still giving you access to some of your funds every year. You start by investing your money into CDs with consecutive annual maturities -- for example, a one-year, a two-year, a three-year, a four-year, and a five-year CD.When the one-year CD matures, you roll those funds into a new five-year CD. The next year, the two-year CD will mature and you put this into a new five-year CD as well, and so on. Every year, another CD will mature and you can withdraw the money if you decide or put it into a new one to keep growing your money.Looking for a CD?

Credit unions, on the other hand, are not-for-profit institutions that are owned by their members and offer a more personal touch. Online banks have emerged in recent years as an alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar banks and provide the convenience of banking from anywhere, anytime.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is the difference between a checking account and savings account?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhile both types of accounts are offered by banks, they serve very different purposes. A checking account is primarily used for everyday transactions, such as paying bills, writing checks, and withdrawing cash. On the other hand, a savings account is designed to help you save money over time, and these often offer higher interest rates than checking accounts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre online-only banks safe?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnline-only banks have been growing in popularity due to their convenience and competitive interest rates. Online-only banks are required to meet the same safety regulations and standards as traditional banks, including having FDIC insurance for up to $250,000 per depositor. Additionally, online-only banks are often equipped with advanced security measures, such as two-factor authentication and biometric identification, to protect against fraudulent activities.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAre credit unions FDIC insured?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNo -- but that doesn\\'t mean you\\'re not protected. Rather than being backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, credit unions are insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). This means they offer the same level of financial protection and security as traditional banks.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHow do I know my financial institution is safe?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith the recent failures of regional banks, it\\'s natural to feel concerned about the safety of your own bank. However, there are ways to ease your worries and ensure your money is secure. First, check if your bank or credit union is insured by the FDIC or NCUA. This guarantees up to $250,000 of your deposits are protected, even if your financial institution were to fail. Additionally, research your financial institution\\'s financial health, such as its liquidity and investment portfolio. Reliable sources such as Moody\\'s or Fitch can provide insight into a bank\\'s stability. It\\'s also important to keep an eye on any news regarding your bank.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"By:\\\\u00a0The Ascent Staff\\\\n and\\\\u00a0David Chang, ChFC\\\\u00ae, CLU\\\\u00ae\\\\nOur Banking Experts\",\"Article Date\":\"September 20, 2023\",\"Label\":\"Perspnal Finance\",\"Article Source\":\"Motley\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Beginner\\'s Guide to Mortgages\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fool.com\\\\/the-ascent\\\\/mortgages\\\\/beginners-guide-home-loans\\\\/\",\"Article Content\":\"Many or all of the products here are from our partners that compensate us.

When you sign a mortgage, your lender agrees to loan you, the borrower, a certain amount of money so you can buy your home. You, in turn, agree to repay that amount, in monthly installments, over a preset period of time -- usually 15 or 30 years. Keep in mind that some people use the terms \\\\\"home loan\\\\\" and \\\\\"mortgage\\\\\" interchangeably.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is included in your monthly mortgage payment?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour monthly mortgage payment is determined by taking the principal amount of your loan -- the sum your lender lets you borrow -- and then applying the interest rate your loan calls for to that sum and spreading what you owe out over your loan\\'s repayment period. Generally, you can choose between a 15-year or a 30-year repayment period. With the former, you\\'ll pay less interest over the life of your home loan, but your monthly payments will be higher. Use our mortgage calculator to see what your mortgage payment may be.Sometimes you\\'ll owe more than just principal and interest on a monthly basis, though. This is because your mortgage lender will take charge of paying your quarterly property taxes and annual homeowners insurance premiums. In that case, you\\'ll pay your lender additional money each month that goes into an escrow account. Your lender will then dip into that account as your property tax payments and homeowners insurance premiums come due.Property taxes are the taxes you pay to your local municipality when you own a home, and homeowners insurance protects you from financial losses when your home sustains damage, or someone gets injured on your property. Property taxes are unavoidable, and while it\\'s technically possible to own property without having homeowners insurance, mortgage lenders generally won\\'t give out a home loan if you don\\'t buy a homeowners policy. It\\'s a good idea to determine how much home insurance you need before shopping around.In the early stages of your mortgage repayment period, more of your money will go toward your loan\\'s interest portion, and less toward its principal. But as time goes on, you\\'ll eventually pay more principal than interest. The process by which this happens is called amortization.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a promissory note?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA promissory note is a secondary agreement that gets signed in conjunction with a mortgage. In it, you pledge to repay your home loan, plus interest, as per your lender\\'s repayment schedule.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a second mortgage?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour initial mortgage is a home loan that makes the purchase of your property possible. A second mortgage, on the other hand, lets you borrow against the value of your home once you\\'re living in it.Second mortgages can come in the form of a home equity loan or home equity line of credit. Equity refers to the percentage of your home you actually own outright, and it\\'s calculated by taking your property\\'s market value and subtracting your outstanding mortgage balance. If your home is worth $200,000, and you owe $150,000 on your mortgage, you have $50,000 worth of equity, which you can borrow against.With a home equity loan, you borrow a lump sum of money and pay it back, at a preset interest rate, over time.With a home equity line of credit, you\\'re granted a specified amount of money you can borrow from during a certain period of time. You don\\'t need to borrow the entire sum at once; you can borrow some money one year, and borrow more money the next year as the need arises.You can take out a second mortgage to make home improvements or repairs to your property, but that money isn\\'t limited to home-related spending; you can borrow it for any purpose. By contrast, your regular mortgage can only be used to buy a home.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMortgage Calculator: How Much House Can I Afford?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTarget Monthly Payment\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCircle with letter I in it.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEnter an amount you can comfortably afford monthly. Don\\'t forget that your actual monthly payment will be higher when adding in property taxes and insurances. We suggest your monthly payment doesn\\'t exceed 28% of your gross income -- that\\'s your income before taxes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nInterest Rate\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMortgage Term (Years)\\\\n\\\\n30\\\\n20\\\\n15\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHome I Can Afford\\\\n{{ getValueResult }}\\\\n\\\\nTotal Mortgage Cost\\\\n{{ getTotalValue }}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSee Current Mortgage Rates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s the difference between a loan and a mortgage?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLoans and mortgages are similar but have a few key differences. Standard loans can take on different forms -- personal loans and business loans are two common examples. In these situations, you\\'re getting a loan either based on your credit score (more on that later), or based on financial need in the case of federal loans for education.Mortgages, meanwhile, are loans specifically designed to enable you to buy a home. While your credit score does play a role in helping you qualify, as is the case with regular loans, one key difference is that mortgages use your home as collateral.When you take out a regular loan, there\\'s no specific asset your lender can come after to recoup its money if you don\\'t make your payments. Mortgages, however, are secured loans, and if you don\\'t pay yours back, your home is the asset that\\'s used as collateral. That means your lender can force the sale of your home via foreclosure and use the proceeds from that sale to get repaid.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApplying for a home loan\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSecuring a mortgage can be a time-consuming process, but it doesn\\'t have to be a daunting one. The first step involves researching lenders to see which are offering the best mortgage rates. The interest rate you pay on your mortgage will determine what that loan costs you over time. The better your credit, the more likely you\\'ll be to snag the most competitive rate a given lender is offering.Mortgage rates are either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed mortgage, you\\'ll pay the same interest rate over the life of your loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, that rate can vary over time, so you may start out paying very little interest but then see that rate climb down the line. In some cases, the rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage can go down over time, too. But if you want the security of knowing what rate you\\'ll be paying throughout the life of your loan, then a fixed-rate mortgage is the way to go.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThings you\\'ll need to secure a mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLenders don\\'t give out mortgages easily. To get one, you\\'ll need:Decent creditA low debt-to-income ratioA down paymentCredit scores range from 300 to 850, and a score of 670 or above is considered good. You may qualify for a mortgage with a lower credit score, but if you do, you probably won\\'t snag a favorable rate on your home loan. If your credit score isn\\'t great, it pays to work on boosting it before securing a mortgage. You can do so by paying incoming bills on time and paying off a chunk of your existing debt.Your debt-to-income ratio, meanwhile, measures the amount of money you owe each month on existing debts relative to your monthly earnings. If you owe too much, mortgage lenders will be less inclined to loan you money, so ideally, you\\'ll want a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or lower. This means that if you bring home $3,000 a month, you shouldn\\'t have more than $1,080 in existing monthly debts. If that ratio of yours isn\\'t favorable, work on paying off existing debt.Finally, you\\'ll need to put some money toward the purchase of your home, the amount of which will depend on the type of mortgage you get. Generally speaking, you\\'ll need a 20% down payment when you take out a conventional loan to avoid private mortgage insurance, or PMI. PMI is a premium designed to protect your lender in the event you\\'re unable to keep up with your mortgage payments. It usually gets tacked on to your monthly mortgage payment and equals 0.5% to 1% of the amount of your mortgage. For example, with a $150,000 mortgage, you\\'ll generally be looking at $750 to $1,500 in PMI annually, spread out over 12 months.For more on the paperwork you\\'ll need to apply, read our guide on what documentation you need to apply for a mortgage.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat are closing costs on a mortgage?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen you finalize a mortgage, you\\'re liable for a host of fees, known as closing costs. Closing costs typically equal 2% to 5% of your mortgage\\'s value. You can pay your closing costs as a one-time expense, or you can often roll them into your mortgage and pay them off over time (with interest). Your lender is required to give you an estimate of your closing costs ahead of time so you\\'re not caught off-guard.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTypes of mortgage loans\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNot all mortgages are created equal. Here are the different types of mortgages you should know about:Conventional mortgagesConventional home loans adhere to the maximum limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the agencies that back most U.S. mortgages. As mentioned, you\\'ll pay PMI if you fail to put down 20% on a conventional mortgage, but you may be able to put down as little as 3%. The borrowing limits for conventional mortgages change from year to year. In most of the U.S., the maximum conforming mortgage for one-unit properties is $510,400 in 2020.FHA loansThese mortgages are backed by the Federal Housing Administration and are geared toward applicants who don\\'t have great credit or don\\'t have the funds for a substantial down payment. You can put as little as 3.5% down with an FHA loan if you have a 580 credit score or above. But, you pay certain premiums with an FHA loan (similar to PMI) that can make your mortgage more expensive.VA loansThese mortgages are available to active members of the U.S. military as well as veterans. VA loans don\\'t require a down payment and don\\'t charge PMI. There are, however, funding fees involved that get tacked onto your mortgage costs.USDA loansBacked by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA loans help lower-income borrowers buy homes in rural areas. If you qualify, you won\\'t have to make a down payment on your home, but that home must be located in a designated zone (buying in a suburb alone does not guarantee that you\\'ll qualify).Jumbo mortgagesThese are conventional mortgages that exceed the maximum borrowing limits. Jumbo mortgages are harder to qualify for than conventional mortgages, and you\\'ll generally need at least a 10% down payment, if not 20%.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRefinancing a mortgage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe mortgage rate you lock in initially doesn\\'t have to be the rate you get stuck with for life. If you refinance your mortgage, you may manage to secure a lower interest rate on your home loan, thereby lowering your monthly payments.Refinancing means swapping one loan for another, and you can do it for many types of loans -- not just a mortgage. The refinancing process is similar to that of applying for an initial home loan -- you shop around for the best rates and then compare the terms different lenders are offering with the terms of your existing loan to see if refinancing makes sense.It often pays to refinance your mortgage if your credit score has improved a lot since you first applied for a home loan. If it has, then you may be eligible for a much lower interest rate than what you\\'re paying right now. It also makes sense to refinance if you want to change the terms of your mortgage -- for example, if you can\\'t keep up with your monthly payments under a 15-year loan, you may want to refinance to a loan with a 30-year term. Or, you may want to do the opposite -- switch from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage.If you\\'re going to refinance, make sure you\\'re planning to stay in your home long enough to recoup the closing costs involved. If you pay $1,800 in closing costs but your refinance enables you to save $120 a month on your monthly mortgage payments, then you\\'ll break even in 15 months. If you plan to stay in your home longer than that, then refinancing makes sense, but if you think there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll move in a year, then you may want to stick with your original home loan.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line on mortgages\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApplying for a mortgage for the first time can be stressful if you don\\'t know what you\\'re getting into. Whether you\\'re purchasing a starter home or forever home, becoming a homeowner is a big step. Now that you\\'ve read our guide to mortgages, you can take steps to ensure that you\\'re ready to apply for one, all the while increasing your chances of snagging a home loan with a favorable interest rate. No matter what type of home loan you\\'re looking at, or how much you\\'re hoping to borrow, shop around for the best mortgage lenders, and give yourself time to work through the process. A little patience could make an otherwise intense process a lot less harrowing.Still have questions?Here are some other questions we\\'ve answered:First-Time Home-Buyer Class: What to Know and Do You Need to Take One?Starter Homes: What Are They and Is One Right for You?First-Time Home Buyer Programs & Grants\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Ascent\\'s best lenders for first time homebuyers\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re a first-time home buyer, our experts have combed through the top lenders to find the ones that work best for those who are buying their first home.

Here with me to discuss some of the contribution limits and tax considerations when investing in 529 plans is Patty Oey. She\\'s a senior analyst with Morningstar\\'s research team.Hi, Patty, nice to see you today.Patricia Oey: Hi, Susan, nice to see you, too. Dziubinski: So, let\\'s start out with the elevator pitch for 529 education savings plans: What are they?Oey: Sure. These plans, what they have is they have a menu of investment options. Usually the default option is something that derisks over time. So if you invest when your child is young, the portfolio will be heavy in equities, and they\\'ll trim the equities down as the time passes, so that when you get ready to spend the money, the equity allocation is lower so you don\\'t see the portfolio value move so much just before you\\'re about to spend it. Plans will also offer a menu of mutual funds and ETFs that you can also invest in, and then finally there is a place to park your cash. So it\\'ll be like a stable value or an FDIC-insured account.Dziubinski: Now, who can invest in a 529 plan and for whom? Oey: Sure. Technically, anyone can open a 529 plan and name a beneficiary. Typically, it\\'s the parents who open a 529 plan for their child, but certainly grandparents can do it. And then someone like me, I have six nieces and nephews\\\\u2014I can open one for each of them as well. And then family friends. So really, anyone can open one as long as there is a beneficiary who\\'s planning to go to school.Dziubinski: Now, can beneficiaries only have one 529 education plan?Oey: No. Again, going back, so I have two kids, so I can open one for each kid and then say, you know, they have their grandparents, two sets of grandparents, so each grandparent can open an account for that one son. Yes, one person can have more than one account. Dziubinski: Now, let\\'s talk a little bit about annual contributions. Are there annual contribution limits when it comes to these plans? For instance, how much can one person invest in someone\\'s 529 plan?Oey: Technically, there is no contribution limits, but putting money into a 529 account, it\\'s considered a gift. So, it is technically subject to the gift tax exclusion. In 2022, that is $16,000. If you do go over, then it gets counted against your lifetime exclusion. That is $12 million. I guess technically, if you know later on that your estate is not going to be close to $12 million, there is no tax penalty for contributing more, but it is technically under the $16,000 limit per beneficiary, per donor. So I can give to my kid $16,000. My husband can also give to that same kid $16,000.Dziubinski: Got it. Now, of course, as you pointed out, more than one person can contribute to a beneficiary\\'s 529 education savings plan. Are there limits in total to how much money can be in a given beneficiary\\'s 529 plan?Oey: Say I have my son, and I have a plan for my son and my parents have a plan for him. The limit is per plan. And then generally, these plans are offered by different states, the states set the limit on how big the accounts can be. Roughly the maximum is equivalent to about a four-year education, tuition plus room and board. On the low end, some states, their maximum is closer to $300,000. On the higher end, it\\'s probably like around $500,000 or more. It just depends on the state. But again, it\\'s per account. For my account, say in our state, it\\'s $500,000, I can max it out to $500,000. And then the plan that my parents open for my child, they can also max it out at $500,000, which is, you know, plenty of money.Dziubinski: Patty, is there a way that an account can be accidentally overfunded? Let\\'s say there is that $500,000 limit in a given account? What prevents it from going over that amount? And if it does go over that amount, what happens?Oey: Yeah, good question. The plans, they have their cap. And so basically, if you hit that threshold, it will not accept more contributions. But certainly the market moves. So if the market continues to move up, they\\'re not going to suddenly just shut down your account. They\\'ll let the market ride and let that account ride. But yes, they will not accept any more contributions once you\\'ve hit the threshold.Dziubinski: Got it. And then just to wrap up, are there any other 529 plan contribution limits, tax considerations, anything that investors should be aware of if they\\'re considering either opening a 529 plan or if they already have one that they\\'re contributing to?Oey: Right. The key thing is that you put the money in the account, it grows, and if you spend the money on qualified expenses, you don\\'t pay capital gains on the ... capital gains that you enjoyed in that account. So everyone is eligible for that benefit. At the state level, different states have their own rules regarding state tax benefits. Some states don\\'t offer any tax benefits. Some states don\\'t have state income taxes, so there\\'s no benefit to offer. And then a whole bunch of other states offer different types of state tax benefit. And what that mainly is, is that you can deduct your contribution when you calculate your state income tax liability.Dziubinski: So before you make a decision, make sure you look at what state benefits you might be able to get from a tax perspective.Oey: Yes.Dziubinski: Sounds good. Well, Patty, thank you so much for walking us through some of these details with 529 plans. Again, they\\'re very popular, are great ideas for saving for college and other educational expenses. But you\\'ve got to know the rules of the road. So, thank you.Oey: Thank you.Dziubinski: I\\'m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Thanks for tuning in.\",\"Article Author\":\"Patricia Oey,  Susan Dziubinski\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"May 20, 2022\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" 5 Charts Tracking Recent 529 Savings Plan Trends    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/1095648\\\\/5-charts-tracking-recent-529-savings-plan-trends\",\"Article Content\":\"The impetus for introducing 529 college savings plans over 20 years ago remains strong: to broaden accessibility to higher education through tax-advantaged investing. Since Morningstar assigned its first forward-looking Analyst Ratings to 529s in 2012, we\\'ve witnessed continuous improvements to these tax-advantaged investing plans, from the quality of the investment options to fee reductions.Assets in 529 plans increased by 17% in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $461 billion by year-end. Since 2011, assets have grown at a fairly steady clip, averaging about 13% a year (see Exhibit 1). Over that same period, growth in direct-sold plans, which tend to carry lower fees, averaged about 15% a year, versus 13% growth in the more expensive advisor-sold plans. Vanguard continues to maintain its lead within 529 plan investment options, holding an approximately 30% market share, followed by Capital Group at 20%. Far behind, but still material players include Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, T. Rowe Price, and Columbia Management, with market shares between 4% and 9%.     Glide Paths: An EvolutionThe 529 college savings plan was designed to be low maintenance and suitable for both novice and experienced investors. Each plan offers a menu of investment options, including aged-based or target-enrollment series, as well as individual mutual funds, and cash or cashlike accounts. The majority of 529 accountholders opt for the age-based or target-enrollment series because of their ease of use. When the beneficiary is young, the portfolio starts with a large allocation in equities, and then shifts to a more conservative positioning by trimming equities and moving into bonds and cash as the beneficiary approaches college age.In recent years, many plan providers have improved their series by adopting a smoother glide path. Some have switched to a progressive glide path, which makes small (around 2%) asset-allocation changes, typically four times a year. Others have added portfolios to their age-based series so that the equity step-downs (which take place in one day) are 12.5% or less. Larger equity steps of 20% or more expose investors to market-timing risk. These large shifts can weigh on returns if they were to take place as markets recover after a large decline. In 2016, over 40% of age-based series had at least one equity step of 21% or greater. By the end of March 2022, series with such large step-downs only accounted for 3% of the industry.     In 2020, a large group of plans moved to a progressive glide path. This included six managed by TIAA-CREF, such as the Gold-rated Michigan Education Savings Program and California\\'s Silver-rated ScholarShare College Savings Plan. Another notable switch to progressive took place in Silver-rated The Vanguard 529 College Savings Plan, which did not go smoothly, as both state sponsor Nevada and Vanguard failed to notice errors in the asset allocation. The pace of change slowed in 2021, when only four plans moved from a stepped glide path to a progressive one: the Silver-rated Pennsylvania 529 Investment Plan, Utah\\'s Gold-rated my529, Connecticut\\'s Neutral-rated CHET Advisor 529 College Savings Plan, and Colorado\\'s Neutral-rated Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan.In April 2021, Pennsylvania switched from offering three age-based series (conservative, moderate, and aggressive) to one target-enrollment option and kept the same underlying fund lineup. Utah\\'s my529 made the change in July 2021, going from four age-based series to one target-enrollment option while also trimming the number of underlying funds. For both plans, the end of the glide path courts a little more risk than their prior conservative and moderate tracks. More specifically, the new progressive glide paths generally hold slightly higher equity allocations relative to the two plans\\' previous moderate options, and include an almost 20% equity allocation in the year prior to the target-enrollment year, whereas the prior conservative options had already moved to a zero allocation in equities. 529 investors who want to minimize downside risk just prior to enrollment should consider moving their assets into a cash or cashlike account.The remaining two plans that moved to a progressive glide path, Connecticut\\'s CHET Advisor 529 College Savings Plan and Colorado\\'s Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan, resulted from a change in program manager to Fidelity Investments and TIAA-CREF, respectively. Both firms employ progressive glide paths in the plans they manage for other states. Industry laggards, with steps of 21% or greater, include the Neutral-rated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan and three nonrated plans: Iowa\\'s IAdvisor 529 Plan, Louisiana\\'s START Saving Program, and Oregon\\'s MFS 529 Savings Plan. Exhibit 3 shows the average equity allocations of 164 age-based or target-enrollment series, divided into five groups. The first group, progressive, includes 53 series. In this group, each plan typically follows one glide path but may provide choice. For example, plans managed by Fidelity, such as Massachusetts\\' Bronze-rated U.Fund College Investing Plan, employ one progressive glide path but provide a choice of three series: one that uses all active underlying funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a blend of active and index funds.The remaining four groups follow an age-based stepped glide path. There are 26 plans that offer one glide path option, depicted as \\\\\"age-based: one option.\\\\\" The remaining plans allow investors to pick their preferred risk profile by providing aggressive, moderate, and conservative options.     Plans that offer one glide path option (progressive and one option) have average equity allocations that are slightly higher than the average moderate glide path. While a higher equity allocation earlier in the glide path can potentially result in higher upside in the long run, investors will likely experience more volatility. That said, in 2020, during and immediately after the pandemic-related market slide, 529 investors appeared to stay put, suggesting that investors can weather volatility without panicking. But a large decline in 529 assets for those just about to enter college can be a stressful time for families. The average portfolio for an 18-year-old in a series with a progressive glide path has 15% in equities and at least 30% in bonds that carry duration and\\\\/or credit risk. In the first four months of 2022, these portfolios saw average declines of 6% to 7% as both equities and bonds sank. More research into spending patterns during a beneficiary\\'s college years may help determine if more conservative options at the end of the glide path may be beneficial for families.Fees Continue to FallAverage fees continue to fall across the investment industry, including 529 savings plans. At the end of 2021, the average fee for an age-based or target-enrollment series was 0.48%, a decline from 0.50% in the year prior. Direct-sold options continue to boast a substantial fee advantage, with average fees of 0.34%, reflecting a decline of 1 basis point from 2020. Meanwhile, advisor-sold plans remain significantly more expensive, with average fees of 0.84%, a decline of 5 basis points from the year prior.     Since their inception, 529 portfolios have often charged higher fees than comparable mutual funds and target-date series owing to additional layers of fees: one for the program manager of the investments and one for the state offering the plan. Over the years, some plans have reduced fees by trimming the state fees and negotiating with their program manager for lower fees. Plans with a growing and relatively larger asset base can achieve some economies of scale, which can be passed on to investors through lower fees. In 2021, Georgia\\'s Silver-rated Path2College 529 Plan earned the distinction of offering the cheapest target-enrollment series, with average fees of 0.09%, a significant decline from its prior fees of 0.22%. This is notable as fee cuts tend to be much smaller. That year, the Georgia Higher Education Savings Board decided to waive its state administrative fee of 0.06% and also successfully negotiated lower program manager fees with TIAA-CREF during the contract renewal process. Other notable fee cuts came from Illinois. For its Neutral-rated Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 age-based series, the state shifted to lower cost-managers in certain asset classes, resulting in average fee declines of 9 to 12 basis points across its aggressive, moderate, and conservative series. For Illinois\\' Gold-rated Bright Start Direct-Sold College Savings, the blend series saw an average decline of 3 basis points, partly owing to a partial shift from active to passive for international-equity exposure. Last year, fee cuts also resulted from a change in program manager. Colorado\\'s Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan selected TIAA-CREF to take over its advisor-sold plan, which now charges average fees of 0.77% for its target-enrollment series, a 16-basis-point decline from the year prior.     Advisor-sold plans remain more expensive than direct-sold plans, and Exhibit 5 provides a partial explanation, as it shows that on average, advisor-sold plans hold a higher percentage of actively managed strategies in their age-based or target-enrollment series. The most expensive offering in the 529 industry is Alaska\\'s John Hancock Freedom 529, whose all-active age-based series charges an average fee of 1.21%. While the series was designed by the topnotch multi-asset team at T. Rowe Price, the exorbitant fees limit its Morningstar Analyst Rating to Neutral. The least expensive advisor-sold option with an all-active underlying lineup is Bronze-rated CollegeAmerica, which is sponsored by Virginia. The plan charges average fees of 0.77% for its target-enrollment series.Another reason for advisor-sold plans\\' higher fees is the annual distribution (or sales) fees paid to the advisor. Arizona, Maine, and North Dakota each offer an advisor-sold age-based or target-enrollment series that only holds low-cost index funds. The weighted average fees for the underlying index funds range from 0.04% to 0.15%, but after the addition of the management, state, and sales fees, the total expense ratios for these series rise to an expensive range of 0.59% to 0.79%.Morningstar doesn\\'t prefer active or passive funds for age-based or target-enrollment series, but our research has consistently shown that over time, lower-fee options provide a reliable edge relative to peers. Lower fees present lower performance hurdles, putting less pressure on portfolio managers to take more risk to make up their funds\\' costs. It\\'s hard even for outstanding asset allocation and talented managers to consistently overcome high costs, especially when their styles are out of favor. Low fees, however, are a dependable advantage that compounds over time and lead to better investor outcomes.This is the fifth and final article in this year\\'s Morningstar series on 529 savings plans.

Yet, despite that popularity, misunderstandings abound about them. Joining me today to provide some clarity on several 529 plan myths is Patty Oey. Patty is a senior analyst with Morningstar\\'s manager research group.Hi, Patty, nice to see you.Patricia Oey: Good to see you, too. Dziubinski: One myth about 529 plans is that they can only be used to cover college tuition. But that\\'s really only part of the story. What else can 529 assets be used to pay for?Oey: Yeah, so you\\'re right. Definitely tuition and fees. It actually can also cover room and board. And should you decide to live off-campus, you can use 529 money to pay for those expenses, up to what the college charges for room and board. So you can do that as well. And then 529 money can also be used for books and your computer. And then the IRS has a list of what other qualified expenses are, but those are the big categories and the big expenses.Dziubinski: Now, in some states also 529 plans can be used for some K through 12 expenses. Is that right? Oey: Yes, that\\'s correct. The federal government put that in one of their recent acts. And at the state level, not all states have agreed to this idea. And so what happens is that if you\\'re in a state which does not allow that, what will happen is that when you take money out of your 529 and then use it to pay for K through 12 private-school tuition, it will not account as a qualified expense, and then you will be charged a penaltyDziubinski: Got it. Now, another myth, perhaps, is that investors are better off sticking with their own-state-sponsored 529 plan because they\\'re going to get some sort of tax benefit in doing so. But not all states offer a tax benefit. Right?Oey: Right. Yes, about a handful of states don\\'t offer any state tax benefit. And when we say \\\\\"tax benefit,\\\\\" we mean state income tax. So like a deduction when you\\'re calculating your state income tax liability. Some states don\\'t offer it. Some states like Florida and Nevada, they don\\'t have an income tax, so there\\'s no benefit to offer. And then maybe about 30 states offer some kind of benefit, but it\\'s important to consider what the benefit is. For one example: Rhode Island, the maximum deduction you can take is $1,000. If you just kind of back-of-the-envelope estimate, if you\\'re a family, you make $100,000 a year, you file jointly, if you make $1,000 contribution to a 529 account or three, you can only deduct $1,000. And then given their tax rates, that\\'s only a savings of like $50, which is not that significant. Other states have a higher limit on how much you can deduct. And maybe if the state taxes are also higher, that same family contributing $3,000, maybe that\\'s worth a couple of hundred dollars per year. Dziubinski: Even if your state does offer a tax deduction or a tax benefit, like you\\'re talking about, there are reasons sometimes where you wouldn\\'t even, nevertheless, you wouldn\\'t stick with your state\\'s plan.Oey: Right. If the tax benefit is not attractive, but also you can look at the plan. If the investment options are fairly mediocre and, then again, if the fees are really high, definitely you can consider looking at other plans. At Morningstar, we do rate over 60 plans. Some of the summaries of our ratings are available on our website. And if you\\'re a subscriber, you can also look at the individual reports on the individual plans.Dziubinski: Another myth is that there are contribution limits to 529 plans, which maybe change annually the way contribution limits change to IRAs or 401(k)s, but that\\'s not the case, right?Oey: I mean, technically, when you contribute into a 529 account, it\\'s considered a gift. So it\\'s subject to the gift tax. And so the exclusion in 2022 is $16,000. And that is per beneficiary, per giver. So, I can give $16,000 to son number one, I can give $16,000 to son number two, and then if my husband wanted to, he can do the same, effectively doubling our gift. If you were to go over the exclusion, it just counts against your lifetime exclusion, which is $12 million.Dziubinski: Patty, another myth that some people believe is that 529 plans will get in the way of how much financial aid a child will qualify for. Is that true?Oey: Yes, this is a very popular question, and a lot of people are concerned about it. When you want to apply for financial aid, you have to fill out the FAFSA form. What the government does is that it evaluates how much the parents can contribute for your education. So they look at the parents\\' income\\\\u2014that is weighed most heavily in terms of how much the parents can afford to pay for school. They also look at savings; that\\'s weighed a lot less, and in that savings bucket includes 529 but also includes bank accounts and other investment accounts. But the idea is that if you are going to be using savings to pay for the school, then it just makes a lot of sense to invest in a 529 account with the tax benefits. But overall, anything that you do to reduce the potential need for more debt in the future will benefit the child in the future.Dziubinski: And then lastly, some might think, \\\\\"OK, well, I want to set up a 529 plan, but I\\'m a little uncertain whether the beneficiary is going to pursue a college education, and then what happens to the money? Is it taxed? Is it gone? What happens?\\\\\" And that\\'s not really the case? What are some things that can be done with 529 assets if, in fact, that beneficiary decides not to pursue what people might think of as a traditional four-year college education?Oey: Right? Yeah\\\\u2014money disappearing? Nobody wants to hear that. So yes, the child maybe gets a full scholarship or decides not to go to school, there are options. The tax code is pretty liberal. You can change the beneficiary. And typically, you can change it to another member of the family, and they are reasonably liberal, where you can change it to another child, but you can also change it to a niece or nephew, a cousin, and also spouses. The IRS has the list, but it\\'s pretty broad in terms of who you can change it to. There\\'s no tax liability for that change. Some might say that there\\'s always the risk that the government will change the laws in the future, and then you know, that would be a problem. That\\'s not on the table right now. It\\'s not a concern at this moment.Dziubinski: Great. Well, Patty, thank you so much for helping bust some of these 529 myths. We appreciate your time.Oey: Thank you.Dziubinski: I\\'m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Thanks for tuning in.\",\"Article Author\":\"Patricia Oey,  Susan Dziubinski\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"May 20, 2022\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" What Is a 529 College Savings Plan?    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/1095553\\\\/what-is-a-529-college-savings-plan\",\"Article Content\":\"Content not found\",\"Article Author\":\"Author not found\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":null}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" Vanguard Maintains Its Lead in 529 Plans    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/1094478\\\\/vanguard-maintains-its-lead-in-529-plans\",\"Article Content\":\"Assets in 529 savings accounts grew over the course of 2021, to $461 billion from $394 billion, reflecting both investor inflows and healthy market appreciation. Overall, the firms most frequently trusted to manage those assets\\\\u2014Vanguard, Capital Group, and Fidelity\\\\u2014remained the same over the past three years. 529 plans are sponsored by individual states, which partner with asset managers, record keepers, or banks to select the investments and to design and manage the plan. Vanguard, Capital Group, and Fidelity are attractive partners, offering strong and broad lineups of mutual funds and well-resourced multi-asset investment teams with established track records.Individually, Vanguard is synonymous with diversification and low fees, Capital Group is renowned for its compelling actively managed offerings, and Fidelity brings together its strength in both active and passive investing to offer more choices to investors. Together, these three firms are responsible for over half of 529 assets under management and their proclivities provide an interesting snapshot of the industry.     VanguardVanguard has more 529 assets than any other firm, with an estimated 30% market share of assets under management. Out of 86 education savings plans, 15 hold all-Vanguard lineups for the equity and bond exposures in their age-based or target-enrollment series. About 10 other plans have offerings where a majority of assets are in Vanguard funds but also include funds from other families. Across all these plans, the most common holdings are Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VSMPX, Vanguard Total International Stock Index VTPSX, and Vanguard Total Bond Market Index VBMPX. Most also hold Vanguard Total International Bond Index VTIFX, and some hold Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index VTSPX. These funds are diversified and attractively priced, a combination of characteristics that continues to support each of their medalist Morningstar Analyst Ratings.     While these plans benefit from this straightforward fund lineup, we have different ratings across plans that hold Vanguard funds in their age-based or target-enrollment series. States that choose Vanguard funds do so because of low fees, simplicity, and broad diversification. But some states do not follow Vanguard\\'s recommendations on how to combine and employ these holdings in an age-based or target-enrollment series. For example, Neutral-rated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan offers four risk tracks, instead of Vanguard\\'s recommended three. The Iowa plan also deviates from Vanguard\\'s glide path of 12.5% equity step-downs, with its Aggressive Growth and Growth options exhibiting large single-day 20% and 30% cuts in equities at the end of the glide path. This exposes investors to market-timing risk and drives our Negative Process rating in this instance. The other two Neutral-rated plans, Arkansas\\' Brighter Future Direct and North Dakota\\'s College SAVE Plan, are weighed by relatively high fees and weak state oversight.     Capital GroupCapital Group (the parent company of American Funds) has the second-largest market share at 20%, or $93 billion in assets. This is accomplished with one plan, CollegeAmerica, which Capital Group manages with minimal interference from its state partner Virginia. This Bronze-rated plan benefits from Capital Group\\'s dedicated multi-asset specialists and seasoned equity and fixed-income investors. CollegeAmerica offers a target-enrollment series with a relatively smooth glide path, and features well-regarded actively managed funds, 87% of which received a Morningstar Medalist rating as of May 2022. While CollegeAmerica earns praise for its investment team and underlying processes, this advisor-sold plan is pricey.     FidelityThe firm with the third-largest market share, at about 9%, is Fidelity. Unlike Capital Group\\'s single plan, Fidelity runs a number of plans and has had long, 20-plus-year partnerships with states such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Delaware. In 2021, the firm won two new mandates and now serves as the program manager for Connecticut\\'s direct- and advisor-sold plans. This brings the total number of plans under Fidelity\\'s purview to eight.     Across these plans, Fidelity offers the same glide path designed by the firm\\'s experienced and well-resourced asset-allocation team. The direct-sold plans provide the option of three tracks (one that uses all actively managed Fidelity funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a mix) and the advisor-sold offers one active track. The underlying holdings are all Fidelity Series funds, many of which are clones of Morningstar Medalists or are managed by Fidelity\\'s top managers such as Jed Weiss for Fidelity Series International Growth FIGSX, Ford O\\'Neill for Fidelity Series Investment Grade Bond FSIGX, and Matthew Fruhan for Fidelity Series Large Cap Stock FGLGX. Though it manages less 529 assets than either Vanguard or Capital Group, Fidelity provides choice (active, passive, or a blend), and that contributes to its ongoing appeal.Asset managers trailing behind these three market share leaders in 529 assets are firms such as Columbia, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, Nuveen, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Voya, which each hold market shares of 1% to 8%. This is the fourth in a five-article series on 529 college savings plans.

If you\\'re a minimalist, it may be tempting to buy a good-quality balanced fund and call it a day. Especially if you\\'re just starting out and the assets in the college savings plan are still small, it may seem like overkill to manage a college portfolio with lots of moving parts.There are certainly worse ways to go about saving for college (life insurance, anyone?). But before you invest your college savings in anything, it\\'s worth considering how investing for college is different from saving for that other long-term goal--retirement. Those differences, in turn, argue for taking a more hands-on approach to asset allocation than a balanced fund would allow. Nor do target-retirement vehicles fit as one-stop options for college savers. Truncated Time HorizonIn contrast to retirement, your child\\'s college matriculation year isn\\'t a negotiable date. A person who encounters a bear market shortly before retirement may have some wiggle room to keep working or rely on other sources of income to avoid tapping his nest egg at a low ebb. But try telling your 18-year-old that he\\'ll have to wait until age 21 to start school so that his college fund will have time to recover.In addition, your time horizon for saving for college is much shorter than is the case for retirement, as is the time horizon for spending those assets. One might save for retirement for 40 years or more and be retired for another 30 or 35 years. But you have less than half that amount of time to amass the funds needed for college, and if all goes well, you\\'ll spend down those assets quickly--in four years or so, or perhaps a few more if you\\'re also footing the bill for graduate school.Both of those facts call for a much steeper glide path--the gradual shift from more-volatile investments such as stocks to more-conservative investments such as bonds--in the years leading up to and during college than the typical glide path before and during retirement. A college portfolio\\'s asset allocation should begin downshifting into cash and bonds when the child is in grade school, and the portfolio should be dominated by bonds by the time the child is in high school. That\\'s because an equity-heavy college fund that encounters a bear market in the years leading up to college could incur losses that it couldn\\'t recoup during the student\\'s time horizon. Even parents who worry that they\\'re grievously behind on college savings should resist the urge to swing for the fences by maintaining a too-high equity allocation too long. (That may be a great temptation for college savers right now, as stocks have trumped bonds and cash over the past decade.)Inflation a Bigger FoeYet college savers must strike a tricky balance because the risks of being too conservative also loom large. Inflation is a major foe for college savers, and a portfolio heavy in bonds and cash could have trouble keeping up with rising tuition costs.While college costs have come under some pressure very recently, the college inflation rate has been double the rate of general inflation since 2001. But current yields have historically been a good predictor of future bond returns, and the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, which serves as a broad bond market benchmark, is currently yielding about 1.7%. That means that investors with extremely conservative asset-allocation plans are going to have difficulty matching the rate of college inflation. Finding a BaselineGiven the specific considerations that should go into a college savings allocation plan, it\\'s probably no wonder that the age-based options within 529 college savings plans have historically held the lion\\'s share of assets. Age-based options aim to provide age-appropriate asset mixes that gradually become more conservative over time, and in so doing they take the onus off of parents and other family members to arrive at an optimal asset mix and to provide ongoing oversight of a portfolio of individual holdings.But the age-based plans also vary widely in their glide paths, and plans are increasingly offering multiple options for a given age band: conservative, moderate, and aggressive. That makes it important to conduct due diligence on a prospective plan\\'s asset-allocation framework and see how it compares with other options within that same general age band. If it\\'s an outlier, make sure you understand and agree with the rationale that its managers use for diverging from the peer group.After you select a plan from your (or any other) state from Morningstar\\'s 529 Plan Center map you can see how that state\\'s age-based glide path compares with the 529 averages for that same age band. For example, the Silver-rated Maryland Senator Edward J Kasemeyer College Investment Plan, managed by T. Rowe Price Group TROW, has a heavier equity weighting (green bar) than its peers (gray mountain chart), especially for younger children with several years until college.Even families who aren\\'t using an age-based 529 option can still use 529 glide paths to help get their own plans\\' asset mixes in the right ballpark. In the table below are the median net equity, bond, and cash weightings for each of Morningstar\\'s age-based 529 categories. You can see that the plans start out with the majority of their assets in equities, then gradually become more conservative over time.\",\"Article Author\":\"Christine Benz\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Jan 19, 2022\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" 3 Themes Shaping the Future of 529 Savings Plans     \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/1040262\\\\/3-themes-shaping-the-future-of-529-savings-plans\",\"Article Content\":\"As a graduation month, May augurs promise. Students reflect on the knowledge they have acquired and how to put it to use going forward.In a year when many 529 savings plans reached the same age as the college graduates who\\'ve tapped their tax-advantaged coffers, it makes sense to consider how these savings tools have evolved, how they can improve, and what they might offer going forward.Since Morningstar assigned its first forward-looking ratings to 529 savings plans in 2012, we\\'ve witnessed multiple improvements to these tax-advantaged investing programs as assets climbed from $167 billion to $394 billion. In the 2021 529 Savings Plan Landscape, we identify a few trends that will continue to shape these plans for investors saving for college, K-12, or other types of education expenses going forward. Morningstar Direct and Office clients can access the full paper here.Asset-allocation practices continue to change. There are now 3 times as many portfolios using gradual glide paths to reduce their risk over time--either with target enrollment approaches or age-based steps of less than 10%--than there were in 2016.529 savings plans now offer more flexibility than at any time since they were introduced. Once, investors could only use 529 savings plan assets to pay for college expenses. But as the list of qualified education expenses has grown, 529s are nearing a future where it could be possible for beneficiaries to tap their savings throughout their working lives when personal, social, or economic forces spur them to pivot to new careers or learn new skills, as the pandemic has prompted many to do recently.Several highly populated states are working to broaden the accessibility of 529 savings plans through initiatives like child savings accounts.The Past Year\\'s Top TrendsLast year pandemic-driven campus and economic shutdowns spurred college tuition inflation to sink nearly 50% from a historical 10-year average of 2.8%. Our research shows that all but two 529 portfolios met their goal of beating tuition inflation over the past three years.As ever, falling fees across the investment industry have been a boon to 529 beneficiaries, though direct-sold options continue to have an advantage over advisor-sold options, whose average fee is 0.54 percentage points higher. In fact, as shown below, no advisor-sold age-based tracks fall in the cheapest or second-cheapest quintiles. And when it comes to college savings, every dollar paid in fees is one less dollar for educational expenses.     Portfolio improvements haven\\'t all gone smoothly. In early 2021, education savers in The Vanguard 529 Plan got a lucky break that may have amounted to over $200 million in extra earnings. In October 2020, Vanguard applied the wrong recommendations in Nevada\\'s The Vanguard 529 Plan, leaving its accountholders with 20 percentage points more in stocks than they should have had. Luckily, this occurred as equity markets rallied in late 2020 and early 2021, so the mistake actually helped investors.Nevada, the plan\\'s investment consultant, and Vanguard didn\\'t notice the mistake for several months before fixing it in March, illustrating that vigilant implementation is as important as plan structure, even for straightforward portfolios like Vanguard\\'s. This is reflected in our updated 529 plan ratings methodology, which assigns value to diligent stewardship and thoughtful collaboration between a state and its program manager or investment consultant. Sharper Asset Allocation in 529 Savings PlansAge-based portfolios are typically the most popular investment options in a 529 savings plan\\'s lineup, followed by static options. These portfolios start out with more equity-heavy asset allocations and transition to conservative portfolios dominated by fixed income as beneficiaries near enrollment, requiring thoughtful curation.There are two types of transitions from stocks to bonds, commonly called glide paths:An age-based glide path makes abrupt shifts to bonds from stocks at predetermined dates by moving assets from one investment option to another, often every few years on a particular date.A progressive track keeps investors\\' assets in a single investment option--similar to a target-date retirement fund--and uses smaller, more frequent asset-allocation adjustments. This provides a smoother transition that is less susceptible to locking in losses if a rebalance occurs during a period of extreme market stress.Our research shows asset-allocation rebalances of 10 percentage points or less mitigate much of this market risk.Over time, these age-based portfolios have improved by incorporating more gradual risk reductions. As shown below, the percentage of 529 savings plans with large (21% and above) equity steps has steadily decreased (from 41% in 2016 to a mere 3% in 2020) as the percentage of plans with progressive glide paths or minimized equity step-downs (10% or less) has markedly increased (from 21% in 2016 to 58% in 2020). The percentage of plans with a moderate equity step-down (11% to 20%) remained steady at roughly 40% in each of the past five years.     Enhanced Flexibility on Approved Education ExpensesOnce investors could only use 529 savings plan assets to pay for qualified college expenses, but 529 plans now offer far more flexibility than at any time since they were introduced. In 2017, K-12 educational expenses joined the list of approved uses for the funds, and the 2019 Secure Act made it possible to pay for apprenticeship programs and cover up to $10,000 in outstanding student loan debt. If they keep evolving like this, 529 savings plans could morph into tax-advantaged pools of assets that beneficiaries could tap throughout their working lives in order to pivot to new careers or learn new skills.Today, investors with nontraditional time horizons or lumpy expenses can use static options, which are stand-alone investments that don\\'t shift asset allocations over time. These options span the risk spectrum, from money market funds all the way to international-stock funds, and plans usually have an array of options for investors to choose from. If flexible spending gains popularity, 529 savings plans could start offering asset-allocation options managed to indefinite horizons, as health savings accounts do.Treading New Ground to Make Education AccessibleState-sponsored education plans took their current shape under section 529 of the tax code over 21 years ago. Through tax incentives that encourage families to invest over time to fund education expenses, these plans help reduce the burden of education loans on young adults and their families. However, from a tax perspective, higher-income families have benefited the most from these incentives. Currently, joint filers making $80,000 or less don\\'t pay taxes on investment gains in taxable accounts. This, in turn, has shaped 529 plan participation, which skews to wealthier households.Many states are working to broaden the accessibility of these investment tools to include lower-income households. Child savings accounts are one idea. These state programs, such as Pennsylvania\\'s Keystone Scholars program (launched in 2019), seed 529 savings accounts with an initial deposit, typically ranging from $50 to $100, for every baby born to or adopted by in-state families. Illinois and California plan to launch similar programs soon. Combined, these three states\\' initiatives will expand the availability of these accounts to families within three of the 10 largest states in the United States.Child savings accounts encourage lower-income households to start making regular contributions early, but they also may limit savers\\' choices and lock them into subpar in-state 529 savings plans. Whether a 529 plan has an associated child savings account or not doesn\\'t affect its Morningstar Analyst Rating, which focuses on the people, parent, and process that directly support a plan. Plans with child savings accounts, though, may appeal to investors who consider environmental, social, and governance factors in their decisions since the programs attempt to help solve a social issue.\",\"Article Author\":\"Madeline Hume\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"May 20, 2021\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" When Should You Start Saving for College?    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/1010710\\\\/when-should-you-start-saving-for-college\",\"Article Content\":\"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I\\'m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Last month, Morningstar released its annual ratings of the best 529 college savings plans for 2020. But choosing a good plan isn\\'t enough. Time is an important part of the equation. Joining me today to discuss when you should start saving for college is Madeline Hume. Madeline is an analyst in Morningstar\\'s Manager Research group on the multi-asset team.Thanks for being here today, Madeline.Madeline Hume: Thank you so much for having me, Susan. Dziubinski: Let\\'s start off by talking a little bit about the ratings. Morningstar made some methodology changes to the ratings this year. Can you talk a little bit about those?Hume: Absolutely. One of the changes that we made was to make our ratings simpler. We now rate four underlying pillars instead of five that roll up to our overall ratings of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. Our Performance Pillar is now getting absorbed into other assessments. Another was to provide greater transparency into what\\'s really driving our ratings, with our written analysis expressing our pillar ratings across the five-point scale, ranging from High to Low.Our Price Pillar puts even greater emphasis on the absolute value of a plan\\'s fees and now conveys our assessment of a plan\\'s fees irrespective of its distribution channel or the strategy of the underlying investment options. As a result, this new methodology favors direct-sold plans over advisor-sold plans. Given how much the investments that 529 plans hold have improved over recent years, our new People Pillar emphasizes the team behind a plan\\'s investment options, which raises the bar for a plan\\'s investment resources. We also don\\'t include any tax benefits in our analysis anymore, given how highly individualized the benefits that individuals receive from contributing to a 529 plan can be.Dziubinski: Given those changes to our methodology, which plans came out with our highest rating of Gold? Did they share any particular traits?Hume: Yes. Two plans were reaffirmed at Gold this year. Bright Start Direct out of Illinois and Utah\\'s my529 plan. Joining them this year was a new entrant, which was Michigan\\'s Education Savings Program. These plans are all unique, but what they have in common is low costs, strong stewardship, and exceptional asset allocation. Any investor that finds themselves in these plans can have confidence that they\\'ve made an excellent choice. Dziubinski: And let\\'s look at the flip side. What are some plans that didn\\'t fare quite as well under our new approach?Hume: Our enhanced methodology does set a higher standard for Neutral ratings, and six plans failed to reach that bar for the first time this year, receiving downgrades to Negative and joining two other plans that were previously given that designation. Five of these downgrades were for those more expensive advisor-sold plans that I mentioned. And all eight of these plans currently charge fees that investors are better off avoiding even if they live in a state that provides some tax benefits for investing in that plan. Some may also have significant design flaws, like large allocation steps.Dziubinski: If someone is looking to open a 529 college savings account, how can they use these ratings to help inform that decision?Hume: Our Medalist-rated plans carry our strongest recommendations from Gold at the highest level down to Bronze. For investors that live in a state with no state-specific income tax benefits or if you have a home state that earns one of these designations, you need look no further than this short list. However, many states offer state-specific incentives and may make up for a so-so plan, which we would give a Neutral rating under our methodology. Again, we don\\'t take those tax benefits into account anymore, given how highly specific each tax situation for a college saver is. So, in those cases, investors should weigh the potential cost savings of a yearly tax benefit against the higher expense ratios and lower-quality investments that these plans provide, ideally in consultation with a financial advisor.Dziubinski: Now, many of these age-based plans work under the assumption that these assets are invested for 18 years. But given how hard choosing a plan can be and saving for college can be, when have you found that families actually start saving for college?Hume: Right. We conducted a study last year that shows that the average 529 account is open when a child is 7 years old and that only gives him 11 years to save for college. That makes an already compressed investing time horizon that much more fraught, and a lot of these plans are designed with 18-year time horizons in mind, so investors aren\\'t getting the full utility out of these plans that they offer.Dziubinski: Then what\\'s the opportunity cost to an investor by starting so late?Hume: Based on that study, to put it into context, for a $50,000 total savings balance, even one additional year that investors delay can cost some potential gains of up to $5,900 depending on when that account is open.Dziubinski: Now, that\\'s significant. What if you are one of those late-start college savers? Do you have any suggestions for those people and what they might be able to do to play a little catch-up?Hume: Right. It\\'s tough. College savers who start investing in 529 plans later do miss out on those equity-heavy portfolios with the most growth potential. While stocks are certainly more volatile than bonds, they do have greater return potential over the long run, and each year that investors wait lowers the growth potential of their savings as age-based portfolios gradually de-risk. College savers may be tempted to make up for lost time by making large contributions or taking on additional risk in their portfolios, but it is hard to make up for years of missed compounding, which underscores the virtue of saving for college as soon as possible. However, college savers do have some benefits that other investment savers like retirement savers don\\'t have, which include student loans and other kind of less traditional investment options. It\\'s prudent to consider the entire menu of options that are available to college savers beyond just the 529 account.Dziubinski: Madeleine, thank you so much for your time today.

The order in which returns unfold over time is important because it can affect the dollar value of a portfolio that has cash flows from contributions or withdrawals. In a nutshell, the periods when more dollars are invested will carry more weight in your overall results.In this article, I\\'ll explain how even a year or two of bad equity-market returns can affect portfolio values for college savers and give some practical tips for dealing with this risk. I\\'ll focus mainly on 529 plans, which we\\'ve covered extensively as one of the best vehicles available for families planning ahead to cover the costs of college education.Background The sequence of returns typically comes up in the context of investing for retirement. A negative sequence of returns during the first few years of retirement can be detrimental because it\\'s a double whammy: It cuts into the portfolio\\'s value right away, but can also put long-term sustainability at risk because as retirees make withdrawals, there\\'s less money left to benefit from an eventual market recovery.  The situation is a bit different for parents or other relatives planning ahead for a child\\'s college education, because both savings and withdrawals are made over a shorter period. While younger investors can invest for retirement over a period of four decades or more, parents usually only have about 18 years to put money away for college. And withdrawals made to pay for college costs typically take place over about four years, compared with a much longer (but ultimately unknown) time horizon for retirees.Because of this compressed time horizon, the main risk for college savers isn\\'t technically the sequence of returns, but really the risk of an equity-market downturn that happens shortly before planned withdrawals start. It\\'s also worth noting that investors can sidestep this risk by using age-based investment options that automatically ratchet down their equity exposure based on the child\\\\u2019s age. Surprisingly, though, age-based and target-enrollment portfolios account for only about a third of all 529 plan assets, with the remainder invested in static allocation portfolios.As with saving for retirement, negative equity-market returns are less of an issue early on. If you\\'re just starting to invest in a 529 plan or other college-savings vehicle for a newborn or young child, a year or two of negative returns won\\\\u2019t dramatically affect your long-term results. But as the portfolio value increases, the risk of too much equity exposure becomes more dangerous. This makes the last few years before your child starts college critically important. In a worst-case scenario, a market downturn later in high school--right in the middle of the usual swirl of activity with college visits, standardized tests, and last-minute applications--could depress the portfolio\\\\u2019s value right before you\\\\u2019ll need to start making tuition payments. Let\\\\u2019s look at a couple of examples to see how this can play out in practice. For illustration purposes, I used an all-equity portfolio and assumed that parents or other college savers contributed $1,000 per year from a child\\\\u2019s birth up through age 18. That\\\\u2019s on the low end given recent costs for tuition, room, and board, but the same patterns would apply with larger contribution amounts. The table below shows portfolio values for a child born in 1984 assuming consistent annual contributions and actual equity market performance through 2002.Exhibit 1: How Sequence of Returns Can Hurt College Savings     Source: Author\\'s calculations. Note: Portfolio values based on $1,000 annual contributions (not adjusted for inflation) and actual returns for the S&P 500 from 1984 to 2002.Up until age 15, this was a pretty positive period for market performance. The portfolio kept chugging along with positive total returns almost every single year, suffering only a small loss in 1990. Assets would have peaked (reaching nearly $94,000) around the child\\\\u2019s freshman year of high school. But with the tech correction starting in 2000, things started to go south. After three straight years of market losses, the portfolio would have shed more than a third of its value by the end of 2002. If the sequence of returns had been reversed, the picture would be far brighter. The chart below shows the portfolio\\\\u2019s value over a hypothetical period during which the S&P 500 earned the same returns as it did from 1984 through 2002, but in reverse order.Despite a rough start with three straight years of negative returns, the portfolio\\\\u2019s value would reach more than $108,000 by the end of the period--about $47,000 higher than in the previous example. That would give the family far more flexibility; they could opt for a more-expensive college, carry over some assets to cover the cost of graduate school, or transfer assets to a younger sibling or other family member. (This is one attractive aspect of 529 plans; account owners can change the plan\\'s beneficiary as long as the new assignee is a family member of the previous one.)Exhibit 2: Different Sequence, Different Results     Source: Author\\'s calculations. Note: Portfolio values based on $1,000 annual contributions (not adjusted for inflation) and actual returns for the S&P 500 from 2002 to 1984 (in reverse order). Mitigating the Risk Of course, these are extreme examples; maintaining an all-equity college fund throughout your child\\'s entire childhood isn\\'t prudent or advisable. And in fact, adding a healthy stake in fixed-income securities is one of the best ways to offset the potential risk of equity-market losses. Although bonds can also be subject to risk from return patterns over time, returns typically fall in a smaller range and can help buffer some of the risk of an equity market downturn. But because of the relatively short time period of a typical four-year college education, a year or two of bad returns at the wrong time can still create problems for more-balanced portfolios. The table below shows the potential impact of the 2008 bear market as an example. While the correction was pretty short-lived, it still would have had a lasting impact, even for a portfolio with a 40% stake in bonds. The bond position helped buffer some of the losses, but the portfolio would have still shed about 20% of its value in 2008. Even with positive total returns for the next three years, the portfolio would have fallen short of the amount needed to cover planned withdrawals of $100,000 over four years.     To avoid this problem, it makes sense to shift toward a much more conservative asset mix in the years leading up to college. As mentioned above, age-based and target-enrollment portfolios can be a sensible, low-effort way to keep risk exposure at the right level. Almost all 529 plans offer these options, which automatically shift their asset mixes more toward cash and bonds as the beneficiary approaches college age.A typical asset mix would be mostly equity starting at birth, gradually shifting down to about 60% in stocks at age 9, 40% at age 13, 30% at age 15, 20% at age 17, and 14% at age 18. Not every age-based track makes gradual adjustments, though. Age-based tracks shift their equity exposure on predetermined dates, and some age-based tracks (such as Iowa\\'s growth track) sell out of 20% or more in stocks on a single day. If stocks happen to sink on the same day, 529 plan owners could end up effectively locking in those losses, exacerbating the risk of a shortfall.Exhibit 4: Median Equity Allocation by Age     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 8\\\\/31\\\\/2020. Equity weightings reflect target equity allocations for 529 plan portfolios in Morningstar\\'s database.Many 529 plans also offer options for different levels of risk, typically labeled as aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The aggressive option for Utah\\\\u2019s 529 plan, for example, targets 70% equity exposure for age 10, compared with 50% for the moderate track and 30% for the conservative option. Choosing the right mix is a matter of personal preference, but also depends on each family\\\\u2019s circumstances. If you want to help finance post-graduate studies or plan to \\\\u201coverfund\\\\u201d the 529 plan with a view toward saving for future beneficiaries, tilting a bit more toward stocks might make sense, as long as you\\\\u2019re willing to live with the additional risk.Do-it-yourself investors can also build a more customized asset mix. In addition to age-based options, most 529 plans offer individual funds that can be used as building blocks for targeting a specific blend of stocks, bonds, and cash. One relatively straightforward option would be to focus more on stocks early on, then shift into a balanced fund combining stocks and bonds, and then gradually build up more bonds and cash during the high-school years.Conclusion Planning for college can be an overwhelming task, and trying to avoid bad returns at the wrong time adds another layer of complexity. But making sure your college fund\\'s asset mix isn\\'t too heavy on stocks--especially as your child approaches college age--is one way to avoid an unexpected outcome.\",\"Article Author\":\"Amy Arnott\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Oct 5, 2020\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" How to Avoid Paying Extra Taxes on Your College Refund    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/983931\\\\/how-to-avoid-paying-extra-taxes-on-your-college-refund\",\"Article Content\":\"Editor\\\\u2019s note: Read the latest on how the coronavirus is rattling the markets and what investors can do to navigate it.If you haven\\\\u2019t already, you could soon get a refund on certain college expenses as campuses across the country closed and schools shifted to remote learning because of the coronavirus pandemic.But if you used withdrawals from a 529 college savings account to cover these costs, you should handle these refunds with care to avoid tax penalties. Here are some things you should know if you\\\\u2019ve opened a 529 plan to help save for education costs, used the funds on tuition or other qualified expenses, and expect to get a refund because of the recent pandemic changes.How do I avoid tax penalties on my refund? If you don\\'t handle your refund correctly, it could be seen as a withdrawal to cover nonqualified expenses, which would be subject to tax penalties.There are two ways to deal with a refund to avoid paying extra taxes: You can spend the refund on other qualified expenses or put the money back into any 529 account with the same beneficiary. If you choose the latter, the refund must come directly from a college or university, and the timing of when you make the deposit is crucial. What to keep in mind: Typically, 529 account owners must deposit the refund into the account within 60 days or the refund will be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal, which gets a tax penalty.The money does not need to go to the same 529 plan that you made the original withdrawal from, but the refund must go back into a plan with the same beneficiary.If you wait longer than 60 days to deposit the money back into a 529 account, it will be considered a new contribution, and the tax penalty on the refund will still apply.This 60-day rule has shifted slightly in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As stated in IRS Notice 2020-23, 529 account owners who got refunds prior to May 15 now have until July 15 to redeposit the funds into a 529 account. The 60-day window still applies to account owners who receive refunds after May 15.Could I use my refund to cover next year\\'s expenses? While the 60-day period doesn\\'t apply when you choose to use your refund on other qualified expenses, timing is still important if you want to avoid tax penalties.What to keep in mind: You must make your withdrawal in the same tax year that you pay for the qualified expenses.If you file your taxes using a calendar-year period, which is typical, you can use your refund to cover qualified education expenses, like tuition and room and board, for the fall semester because the refund and payment fall in the same tax year.Even if you are technically paying for 2021 costs, the refund will still count as a qualified withdrawal if you make the payment in 2020.What are some expenses that I could use my refund to cover? You can use tax-free withdrawals from a 529 account to pay for qualified expenses (see Section 8 of this IRS document) that include tuition, mandatory fees, books, computers and software. Because many colleges and universities have set up online courses, it may make sense to use the money to pay for Internet access or to purchase a computer.You could also put the refund toward student loans. As part of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, or SECURE Act, up to $10,000 total from a 529 plan can be used to repay the beneficiary\\\\u2019s student loans. This includes federal and most private loans. Further, an additional $10,000 can go toward each of the beneficiary\\\\u2019s siblings\\\\u2019 student loans.Of course, there\\'s no one-size-fits-all approach to using 529 funds. But it\\\\u2019s important for investors to understand what costs you can cover without any tax penalty.What are the tax penalties for nonqualified withdrawals? Transportation, extracurricular activities, health insurance, and other noneducation costs are considered nonqualified expenses.What to keep in mind:Any taxes or extra tax penalties will only apply to the money that your 529 plan\\'s investments earn because the contributions you make have already been taxed.Withdrawals from 529s must be a combination of contributions you made to the account and the money you earn from the plan\\'s investments. For example, if your account has $4,000 in contributions and $6,000 in investment earnings, withdrawing $1,000 takes $400 from contributions and $600 from earnings.Withdrawals for nonqualified expenses get a 10% tax penalty on the investment earnings portion. For example, if you use $1,000 on nonqualified expenses and $600 of the withdrawal come from earnings, you will owe an extra $60 in taxes on top of any income taxes that you owe on that $600.You will owe applicable federal income taxes on your investment earnings but not contributions.You may have to repay any state income tax breaks you received on those contributions.\",\"Article Author\":\"Margaret Giles\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"May 11, 2020\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"529 Plans: What\\\\u2019s Changed and What\\\\u2019s the Same?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/themes-across-529-plan-landscape-6-charts\",\"Article Content\":\"Since their launch more than 20 years ago, 529 college savings plans have helped students and their families better access higher education through tax-advantaged investing. In this annual industry review, we discuss key themes across the 529 college savings plan landscape, including education inflation, asset growth, declining fees, and more.Backdrop\\\\u2014Education Inflation Is Back on the RiseFor most of the past two decades, the cost of education rose more quickly than the general inflation rate, with the Consumer Price Index growing at 2.5% annually while the Tuition Index grew at 4%. Although this trend reversed in 2020 and has remained so since, it does not mean that education inflation has subsided. Rather, education inflation just briefly paled in comparison to the general price index as the world dealt with some extraordinary issues over the past few years. In fact, rolling 12-month inflation data shows that education inflation is on the rise again, easily surpassing 3% in March 2023. Continually rising tuition costs underpin the importance for families to save early and frequently within a 529\\\\u2032s tax-advantaged structure; the additional time helps harness the effects of compounding to keep up with these increasing costs.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tGrowth of CPI vs. Tuition (Indexed)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tGrowth of CPI vs. Tuition (Indexed) over the past 20 years ended in April 2023.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t     Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Data as of 05\\\\/30\\\\/2023. 529 Industry Assets Fall in 2022In 2022, we saw a sizable decline in total 529 plan assets, the largest over the past decade, which had been a steady period for growth. Assets in 529 plans decreased by nearly 17% in 2022, dropping to $385 billion by year-end from $461 billion. Hardly any plan was immune to the market decline, with a vast majority of plans experiencing a decrease in total assets; the median loss was 14%. Direct-sold plans, which tend to carry lower fees and have grown faster than advisor-sold plans over the past decade, lost 15.8% on average. On the other hand, an average advisor-sold plan lost 20% of its assets in 2022.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAssets Under Management by Distribution Channel\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA time series chart showing assets under management by distribution channel.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t     Source: Morningstar Direct, surveyed data, and author\\\\u2019s calculations. Data as of 12\\\\/31\\\\/2022. Glide Paths Have Become Smoother; Plans Pause on Taking Additional Equity RiskMost 529 accountholders utilize an age-based or target-enrollment strategy, which is a set-it-and-forget-it type of investment that starts with a large allocation in risky assets (that is, equities) when the beneficiary is young. As the beneficiary grows older, the portfolio transitions to a more conservative positioning by allocating more to bonds and cash or cashlike accounts. A glide path shows how an age-based or target-enrollment series\\\\u2019 allocation shifts to a more conservative positioning as the beneficiary grows closer to college enrollment. Over the years, Morningstar has cautioned investors against glide paths with large equity steps (21% or more), as they expose investors to market-timing risk. If a portfolio happens to derisk after a large market decline, investors risk locking in their losses and capping their upside by selling stocks at their low and allocating those funds to bonds and cash.In recent years, many plan providers have improved their series by adopting a smoother glide path, and 2022 was no exception. Several plans have adopted a progressive glide path, which makes small (around 2%) asset-allocation changes, typically four times a year. Others have added portfolios to their age-based series so that the equity step-downs (which take place in one day) are 12.5% or less. By the end of 2022, close to 80% of all plans featured equity steps of 10% or less, while series with large step-downs accounted for less than 3% of the industry.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPercentage of Series by Greatest Equity Step\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA chart showing the percentage of total available age-based\\\\/target-enrollment series by their greatest equity step-downs.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\\\\/31\\\\/2022 The chart below shows the average equity allocation of 166 age-based or target-enrollment series, divided into five groups. The first group, progressive, includes 60 series that typically follow one glide path but may provide choice. For example, plans managed by Fidelity, such as Massachusetts\\\\u2019 U.Fund College Investing Plan, which has a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Bronze, employ one progressive glide path but provide a choice of three series: one that uses all active underlying funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a blend of active and index funds. This group saw several new entrants, including Idaho\\\\u2019s Vanguard Target Enrollment series and Arkansas\\\\u2019 Bright Future Target Enrollment series, launched in April and September 2022, respectively. These new plans harbor varying risk appetites along the glide path. On average, however, there were not any notable changes in the equity allocation.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAverage Glide Paths for Progressive and Age-Based Series\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA graph showing average glide paths for age-based and target-enrollment series.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t     Source: Morningstar Direct.

There are 25 plans that offer one glide path option, depicted as \\\\u201cage-based: one option.\\\\u201d This group saw a roughly 2% increase in equity allocation across the glide path. Other plans allow investors to pick their preferred risk profile by providing aggressive, moderate, and conservative options. These \\\\u201ctarget-risk\\\\u201d glide paths saw little increase in equity allocation; in fact, the equity stakes decreased in some parts of the glide path. Fees Continue to FallAverage fees continue to fall across the investment industry, including 529 savings plans. By the end of 2022, the average fee for an age-based or target-enrollment series was 0.46%, a 2-basis-point decline from the year before. Direct-sold plans maintained their fee advantage and slashed another 3 basis points, arriving at an average fee of 0.31%. Advisor-sold plans remained significantly more expensive, with an average fee of 0.83% after a basis-point decline in 2022.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAverage Total Expense Ratios of Age-Based and Target Enrollment Series\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA chart showing the time-series data for average total expense ratios of age-based\\\\/target-enrollment series.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 05\\\\/30\\\\/2022 Fee reductions can come from multiple sources. A switch to cheaper (often passive) underlying funds is one way. For example, Bronze-rated Florida 529 Savings Plan switched to index funds in the target enrollment series in 2022 and became the cheapest plan in the industry. Illinois\\\\u2019 Bronze-rated Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 plan also added an all-passive track in November 2022 that features Vanguard and iShares index funds, offering a cheaper option to its investors. Other plans have trimmed their state fees and\\\\/or negotiated with their program manager for lower fees. Plans with a growing and relatively larger asset base can achieve some economies of scale, which can be passed on to investors through lower fees. For instance, Silver-rated Oregon College Savings Plan met its $2.5 billion breakpoint in 2022, resulting in a slight reduction to its asset-based fees. Moreover, as the team saw stable asset growth, it cut its administrative fee by 5 basis points.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAge-Based and Target-Enrollment Series Fees by Distribution and Allocation in Active Funds\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t \\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA scatterplot showing the distribution of age-based and target-enrollment series\\' allocation to active funds and their average total expense ratio.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\\\\/31\\\\/2022 Advisor-sold plans remain more expensive on average than direct-sold plans, partially because of their higher allocation to actively managed strategies (see chart above). While holding actively managed strategies itself is not a flaw, investors need to ensure that the fees do not eat into their investment returns. For instance, New Hampshire\\\\u2019s Fidelity Advisor 529 Plan earns a High People rating thanks to its impressive lineup of active managers. However, a hefty price tag that ranges from 0.67% to 1.85% keeps its rating at Neutral.Having said that, advisor-sold plans can hold index funds and still be expensive because of sales and distribution fees paid to the advisor. For instance, Maine offers an advisor-sold series that only holds low-cost index funds. The weighted average fee for the underlying index funds is just 8-10 basis points, but after adding program management, administrative, and distribution fees, the average total expense ratio ranges from 0.57% to 1.37%.As the Price Pillar accounts for 30% of the Morningstar Medalist Rating for 529 plans, there are very few advisor-sold plans that earn a Bronze rating or higher. As of June 2023, only three such plans exist: Illinois Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 Plan, Ohio\\\\u2019s BlackRock CollegeAdvantage, and Virginia\\\\u2019s CollegeAmerica. All three earn Above Average or High ratings in all pillars besides Price, reflecting a well-thought-out process, high-caliber investment personnel, and\\\\/or exemplary oversight. Morningstar doesn\\\\u2019t prefer active or passive funds for age-based or target-enrollment series. In fact, we recognize promising 529 plans offering series across the active-passive spectrum. However, our research has consistently shown that, over time, lower-fee options provide a reliable edge relative to peers. Lower fees present lower performance hurdles, putting less pressure on portfolio managers to take more risk to make up their funds\\\\u2019 costs. It\\\\u2019s hard even for outstanding asset allocation and talented managers to consistently overcome high costs, especially when their styles are out of favor. Low fees, however, are a dependable advantage that compounds over time and can lead to better investor outcomes.\",\"Article Author\":\"Hyunmin Kim\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Jun 12, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"2 Top-Rated 529 Plans\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/2-top-rated-529-plans\",\"Article Content\":\"Morningstar currently rates 54 529 plans, representing 93% of the assets in the industry. Of those 54, two receive our top mark of Gold, reflecting our highest confidence in the plans\\\\u2019 ability to provide participants with compelling investment results.While these two plans may not be the best options for everyone (once personal preferences or tax situations come into the picture), they serve as examples of what is possible in a 529 plan, and it behooves diligent investors to take note.Why? Because best-in-class standards help an investor shape expectations and make a selection, even as applied to a subset of 529 options best suited to their personal profiles. Below, we discuss some of the features that distinguish the two Gold-rated plans from their peers. Before We Start: Applying Morningstar\\\\u2019s Medalist Rating to 529 PlansMorningstar\\\\u2019s Medalist Rating for 529 plans considers four supporting pillars:PeopleProcessParentPriceFor each pillar, we look for what we believe are best-in-class industry practices, including:Skilled investment teams with experience managing multi-asset strategies;A well-researched asset-allocation approach;A robust process for selecting investments and managing risk;The state agency\\\\u2019s ability to provide thoughtful oversight and stewardship; andLower fees relative to Morningstar Category peers in age-based or target-enrollment options.The pillar scores are then rolled up to arrive at a Morningstar Medalist Rating, which reflects our analysts\\\\u2019 confidence in each plan\\\\u2019s ability to offer a compelling risk-adjusted performance relative to peers.First-Rate Plans: Michigan and UtahAs of May 2023, the two plans that hold Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold are the Michigan Education Savings Program and Utah\\\\u2019s my529. Each offers a well-designed age-based or target-enrollment series, which are set-it-and-forget-it investment options that gradually derisk during the accumulation and savings period. They also employ a solid menu of static options of mutual funds and\\\\/or exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to individual asset classes and a safe vehicle to park cash, such as an FDIC-insured savings account.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTwo Top-Rated 529 Plans\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Utah: Customization for Experienced InvestorsUtah\\\\u2019s my529 has consistently been one of our favorite offerings, setting industry standards on many fronts and currently differentiating itself from peers with customization capabilities.The series employs a progressive glide path, which starts with a 100% allocation to equities and falls to 17% by enrollment. This gradual shift is an industry best practice, as it helps education savers avoid the risk of meaningfully shifting out of equities just after a market dip, when there is the potential to lock in losses. The underlying lineup using Vanguard index funds provides broad market exposure at a low cost. This design earns it an Above Average Process rating. The fees for these portfolios are low, at 0.14%-0.15%. The team behind my529 boasts topnotch resources, underpinning a High People rating. Instead of hiring an investment manager for the plan, the state employs its own well-resourced and experienced investment team. A dedicated group of roughly 75 professionals handles everything from portfolio management to recordkeeping. The team also receives support from an investment advisory committee and multiple independent consultants. These additional resources and insights provide an edge compared with the typical 529 peer. We rate the state parent as High because its centralized oversight structure allows for engaged stewardship of the plan, and the state has earnestly continued to reduce fees.One distinctive feature that only the Utah plan offers is the ability to create a custom series in which investors design their own glide path and select the underlying investments. The investment menu includes 22 options, such as Vanguard index funds and DFA funds that cover broad asset classes, style and size, and strategies with a sustainable investment focus. Given the degree of customization for this option, it is suitable for experienced investors or those who work with an investment advisor.Michigan: Low Cost, Easy to UseMichigan Education Savings Program offers an easy-to-use, straightforward series with extremely low average fees of 0.10%. Michigan also employs a progressive glide path, but one slightly flatter than Utah\\\\u2019s, as it starts with an 80% equity allocation and lands at 20% by college enrollment. (This can result in some performance differences depending on the market environment.)This shape is influenced by the historical average age of the beneficiary when the account opens. This prudent approach aids investors who may have delayed saving for education expenses and supports a High Process rating. The enrollment-date portfolios hold mostly index funds, with a slightly more diversified lineup relative to Utah, as it also includes REITs, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and high-yield bonds.This plan was designed via an effective collaboration between the Michigan Bureau of Investments and its dedicated program manager TIAA, driving its Above Average People rating. Michigan, with its investment staff, conducts in-house research and taps participant studies to make informed investment decisions on behalf of beneficiaries. For instance, the state worked closely with TIAA to design the target enrollment glide path that came into effect in 2020. It also pushed for improvements in the underlying lineup, resulting in an offering that includes highly rated Vanguard, iShares, Schwab, and TIAA funds. This move also resulted in lower fees for the series, and the plan continues to be among the cheapest in the industry. Their dedication to shaping a simple, low-cost plan around their participants\\\\u2019 evolving needs also supports a High Parent rating.ConclusionThe two Gold-rated 529 plans differ on some fronts, but they share the key characteristics of being excellent stewards of capital for the end investors. Namely: a skilled investment team, a robust investment and oversight process, reasonably low fees, and more. While these plans exemplify many of what Morningstar considers as best practices, there are many other plans we rate that investors can explore. Depending on personal circumstances and preferences, a thoughtful investor can still settle on a different plan.

You can learn more about 529 college savings plans and how to start saving in our 529 guide. Movers and Shakers in Our 529 RatingsAt the overall plan level, 529 ratings moves were modest\\\\u2014two downgrades and six upgrades\\\\u2014with a few notable themes across the underlying pillars. Vanguard-managed plans that employ an age-based structure experienced Process rating downgrades to Average, as these offerings now feature less attractive traits, such as an aggressive track that has above average duration risk in and near enrollment, and conservative and moderate tracks that derisk relatively early, meaning investors are less likely to keep pace with the rising costs of higher education. Stewardship standards for each state, as reflected in the Parent rating, continue to rise, with elements such as evidence of robust interaction between the state and its investment entity set as a baseline; two states were upgraded and two downgraded within this context. And in good news for 529 investors, fees continue to inch downward. The average fee as of our 2022 review fell to 0.45% from 0.48% in 2021 (prior to 2022, the average fee was calculated across only plans under coverage, but the average fee calculation now includes all 529 plans, regardless of coverage, and provides a more representative context for industry trends). Many plans continue to employ index funds and exchange-traded funds, when possible, improving cost efficiency for investors.In 2022, 34 plans received a recommended rating in the form of Gold, Silver, or Bronze. Morningstar Medalist plans offer investment options that should outperform and exhibit some combination of the following attractive features:A well-researched asset-allocation approachA robust process for selecting underlying investmentsA well-resourced and experienced investment teamStrong, stable, and engaged oversight from the stateLow feesInvestors in these medalist 529 plans should be well-positioned for the future.The remaining 20 plans with Morningstar Analyst Ratings are Neutral or Negative and are dominated by advisor-sold plans, whose high fees detract from their overall ratings. Of the 16 Neutral-rated plans, 11 are advisor-sold, six of which carry Above Average Process ratings, indicating these plans offer well-designed investment options. The compounding impact of high fees, however, can hinder performance and the total amount saved over the long term. Negative-rated plans may exhibit a subpar asset-allocation approach, an unattractive lineup of underlying funds, and\\\\/or high fees that reduce the odds of investor success. Many states offer income tax benefits to 529 participants who invest in their home state\\\\u2019s plan, but these benefits vary widely. Some are generous, offering tax credits on low contributions. For other states, the tax benefit is dependent on the contributors\\\\u2019 marginal state income tax rate and state deduction limits. Morningstar does not factor state tax benefits into its ratings, but 529 plan participants can consider the potential tax benefits of investing in their state\\\\u2019s plan, along with our ratings, as part of their decision-making process.Gold 529 Ratings: Industry Standard SettersIn 2022, two plans merit Analyst Ratings of Gold. The excellent stewardship of the state Parents of the Michigan Education Savings Program and Utah\\\\u2019s my529 result in well-designed, low-cost offerings.     In 2020, the Michigan plan moved to a target enrollment structure, in which participants see a gradual shift to bonds from stocks; this mitigates the risk that comes with equity step-downs during volatile markets (age-based series make larger, more infrequent step-downs). To plan this transition, the treasurer\\\\u2019s office worked closely with its investment manager TIAA-CREF to design the glide path to benefit the average beneficiary in this plan, who typically starts saving at around 5 years old. At the same time, the state pushed for improvements in the underlying lineup and now the plan features highly rated Vanguard, iShares, Schwab, and TIAA-CREF funds. This move also resulted in lower fees for the series, and the plan continues to be among the cheapest in the industry.Utah\\\\u2019s my529 plan is the only plan that has received a Gold medal every year since we debuted our ratings in 2012. Utah moved from an age-based to a target enrollment structure in 2021, and it incorporated insights from participant data and asset-allocation research into this new glide-path design, benefiting set-it-and-forget-it savers. The plan also continues to offer its unique, custom age-based portfolios that allow investors to build their own glide paths using Vanguard and DFA funds. State oversight continues to be topnotch. Instead of hiring an investment manager for the plan, the state employs its own well-resourced and experienced investment team and draws upon a network of experts, including its board, an investment advisory committee comprising institutional investors and advisors, and consultants. Silver 529 Ratings: Standard CarriersAlmost all of the Silver-rated plans have an Above Average or High rating for both People and Process. This indicates that a highly regarded investment team employs a rigorous process regarding glide-path design, asset allocation, manager selection, and risk management to create an offering that is suitable for 529 beneficiaries.There are two new Silver-rated plans this year. Illinois\\\\u2019 Bright Start Direct-Sold College Savings was downgraded to Silver from Gold because of recent turnover in the state treasurer\\\\u2019s office, and the Wisconsin Edvest 529 Plan was upgraded to Silver from Bronze following improvements to the target enrollment lineup and fee cuts.     Bright Start\\\\u2019s partnership between the Illinois treasurer office\\\\u2019s investment professionals and investment advisor Wilshire has long been a source of strength. The state actively manages its age-based series with regular small adjustments to the underlying fund lineup. One ongoing trend is the effort to gradually shift to passive from active funds in more efficient asset classes. In 2021, the state\\\\u2019s director of investment analysis and due diligence was promoted to chief investment officer, and later that year, his sole team member\\\\u2014and replacement\\\\u2014departed. The CIO now works with an interim director (as of August 2022) and a new analyst hired in late 2021 who is new to the industry. These changes lowered the plan\\\\u2019s People rating to Above Average from High and caused an overall downgrade to Silver. Overall, this plan is still a strong option, offering three risk-based tracks, available with either very low-cost index funds or a strong mix of active and passive strategies composed of many Morningstar Medalists.In May 2022, Wisconsin improved its target enrollment series\\\\u2019 underlying fund lineup, swapping in three highly rated Vanguard funds and removing three actively managed TIAA-CREF funds. This change, along with newly negotiated program manager fee cuts, resulted in a large 30% average fee reduction and a Price Pillar upgrade. Wisconsin\\\\u2019s open-architecture approach has become more like those of the Silver-rated direct-sold plans that TIAA-CREF manages for California, Georgia, and Minnesota. As such, we have upgraded this Wisconsin plan to Silver.The Vanguard 529 College Savings Plan, Pennsylvania 529 Investment Plan, and Ohio\\\\u2019s CollegeAdvantage 529 Savings Plan also earn Silvers. Vanguard is the investment manager for these plans, all of which have adopted Vanguard\\\\u2019s new target enrollment structure. MOST Missouri\\\\u2019s 529 Education Plan has not adopted the target enrollment structure but retains its Silver rating because of strong state Parent stewardship and recent fee reductions.Other Silver ratings include plans (offered by Alaska and Maryland) run by a topnotch team at T. Rowe Price. These are favorites among all-active target enrollment series. Silver-rated Oregon College Savings Plan distinguishes itself with a target enrollment series that features a portfolio for every year (most plans offer portfolios every two or three years).Bronze 529 Ratings: Meeting and Sometimes Exceeding StandardsBronze-rated plans tend to have a mix of Average to Above Average ratings across the People, Process, Parent, and Price Pillars. They can still help investors meet their goals, but the range of outcomes is wider than those of Silver- or Gold-rated rivals.     Four plans were upgraded to Bronze from Neutral in 2022. Indiana\\\\u2019s CollegeChoice 529 Direct Savings Plan earned a Process upgrade by improving the diversification of its target enrollment series\\\\u2019 by increasing its exposure to non-U.S. stocks to 35% within the equity sleeve (from 25%) and adding a real estate fund. Other improvements included removing a credit-sensitive bond strategy and dropping average fees by 25%.Fee cuts also elevated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan and Illinois\\\\u2019 Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 College Savings Program to Bronze from Neutral. Iowa trimmed its program management fee this year, making it among the industry\\\\u2019s cheapest. Illinois\\\\u2019 Bright Directions\\\\u2019 average fees for its age-based series are the lowest among advisor-sold plans. In November 2022, the plan will launch a lower-cost index-based series, which will further reduce average fees.Nebraska\\\\u2019s Bloomwell 529 Education Savings Plan earned an upgrade because of increased confidence in its offering, which features two options: a core low-cost index fund track and a socially aware track whose underlying holdings include Morningstar Medalist iShares ESG equity funds and a high-quality bond sleeve.Vanguard plans that continue to use the age-based structure instead of the newer target enrollment structure all saw Process rating downgrades to Average from Above Average. These include North Carolina\\\\u2019s National College Savings Program, MOST Missouri\\\\u2019s 529 Education Plan, Colorado\\\\u2019s CollegeInvest Direct Portfolio College Savings Plan, and New York\\\\u2019s 529 Program (Direct). North Carolina\\\\u2019s and Colorado\\\\u2019s overall ratings remained Bronze, but New York\\\\u2019s fell to Bronze from Silver and Missouri retained its Silver. Vanguard\\\\u2019s age-based offerings have outdated traits such as above-average duration risk in the aggressive track and overly conservative moderate and conservative tracks that remove equity exposure by 17 and 13 years old, respectively.Neutral 529 Ratings: Industry StandardThe list of Neutrals remained consistent. It includes many advisor-sold plans whose layers of fees offset their Above Average Process ratings. New Mexico\\\\u2019s Scholar\\\\u2019s Edge has made adjustments that bring it more in line with evolving industry standards, prompting an upgrade of its rating to Neutral from Negative.     Negative 529 Ratings: Below StandardSeven plans earned Negative ratings in 2021. Four of them stayed Negative in 2022, New Mexico\\\\u2019s Scholar\\\\u2019s Edge moved to Neutral, and two plans were dropped from coverage: Nevada\\\\u2019s SSgA UPromise 529 Plan and USAA 529 Education Savings Plan.     There were some pillar changes among the Negatives. College Access 529 Plan saw a People downgrade to Below Average, as a new firm with fewer resources took over. Virtus provided a home for three members of the team after the SEC disqualified their previous employer Allianz Global Investors from providing advisory services to U.S.-registered funds effective July 2022. This transition hollowed out the plan\\\\u2019s investment team, as it lost access to Allianz\\\\u2019s 80-person global multi-asset outfit.For New Jersey, recent improvements to its direct and advisor-sold age-based series\\\\u2019 underlying fund lineups drove a Parent rating upgrade to Below Average from Low. The new fund lineup also features lower cost strategies, improving New Jersey\\\\u2019s Franklin Templeton 529 College Savings Plan\\\\u2019s Price rating to Above Average from High.Morningstar Analyst Rating InputsWe began rating 529 education savings plans in 2012. Over that period, these tax-advantaged investment options have gained popularity, as assets climbed from $167 billion to over $386 billion as of August 2022. The 529 industry continues to evolve, and in July 2020, we rolled out an enhanced rating methodology, reflecting our updated views on what an industry-standard plan looks like and what aspects of a plan warrant our highest conviction. We evaluate plans based on four key pillars: Process, People, Parent, and Price. Pillar-level research informs our holistic view of plans and results in the Morningstar Analyst Rating for 529 plans.The 2022 ratings (54 plans covered) featured a total of eight upgrades or downgrades, compared with 11 in 2021 (62 plans covered) and 27 in 2020 (61 plans covered). The implementation of our enhanced ratings methodology in 2020 sparked an increased number of upgrades and downgrades compared with prior years, but with this rubric well-exercised for a third year running, our forward-looking ratings were within expectations.\",\"Article Author\":\"Patricia Oey\",\"Label\":\"save-for-college\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Nov 2, 2022\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"The Best Way to Save for College\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/1117187\\\\/the-best-way-to-save-for-college\",\"Article Content\":\"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I\\'m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Morningstar director of personal finance and retirement planning Christine Benz has put together a monthly financial to-do list for 2022, and October\\'s to-do is all about how to save for college.Christine, thanks for being here. Good to see you.Christine Benz: Good to see you, Susan. Key TakeawaysFinding balance is key. It\\'s important to balance college savings alongside other important financial goals, retirement savings being the main one.If you go with your home state\\'s 529 plan, you\\'re typically able to earn a tax break on the contribution.Don\\'t overcomplicate saving for college. Typically 529 plans offer age-based tracks, so you can select the plan that corresponds with your child\\'s age, and those options are really hands-off.Overextending the parents\\' financial situation in an effort to pay for college is a big mistake that investors make.Dziubinski: One key challenge that many families face is, I have, you know, I want to send my kids to college. I want to save for college, but then I have these other goals like retirement. Any tips for how to think about balancing a variety of different goals when college is one of them.Benz: Balance, is really the keyword. Like so many things in life, it\\'s important to balance college savings alongside other important financial goals, retirement savings being the main one. You have to put retirement savings in the front seat, because if you come up short with your retirement savings, you just simply have fewer levers than you do with college. And another thing I would say on the college front, I think parents might be put off by these incredibly high numbers we see in the realm of what college costs today. I was looking at in-state tuition at public universities--$9,000, $19,000 for out-of-state students at those public universities. Some elite public universities are charging well more than that. And of course private-school tuition has gone through the roof, too, where it\\'s like $38,000 I believe is the average, and many elite private institutions are charging upward of $60,000.Don\\'t be blinded by those really high numbers, recognize that for all but very, very wealthy families, college funding is probably going to come from a variety of sources. So, it might be your personal savings, that might be a component of it, but so might financial aid, so might loans, so might a healthy dose of compromise on the part of your student, and that might entail some work in college. When college comes close, you\\'ll be able to look at the whole toolkit and recognize that for many households, aid, financial aid, merit-based aid will be a big piece of the puzzle. I would urge everyone to read Ron Lieber\\'s great book on this topic. It\\'s called The Price You Pay for College. Really great explainer of how merit-based aid works. Dziubinski: And in your podcast The Long View you actually interviewed Ron about this very topic about a year ago.Benz: We did, and he is a fount of wisdom on this topic of paying for college.Dziubinski: Now there are already different vehicles or tools that parents or family can use to help save for college. What do you recommend? What do you think is the best tool for folks to use. Benz: Well, I would say the basic, main receptacle that people should use is a 529 college savings plan. And there are a few key reasons to look at 529, the big one is tax breaks. So if you go with your home state\\'s plan, you\\'re typically able to earn a tax break on the contribution. As long as the money stays within the 529 plan, you\\'re able to enjoy tax-deferred compounding on your money. And then when the money comes out to pay for college, assuming it\\'s going for qualified college expenses, those withdrawals are also tax-free. You get some nice tax breaks for using a 529 plan. The other big advantage is that for super savers especially, you can get a lot of funds into a 529 plan and there aren\\'t any income limits that would clamp down on how much you can put in there. So, some nice tax benefits and also just a lot of flexibility built in.Dziubinski: How would an investor have a sense of what they should be looking for when they\\'re choosing a 529 plan?Benz: I would say the starting point is to look at your home state\\'s 529 plan. But I would also urge people to take a look at our College Savings Center on Morningstar.com. We\\'ve got a map where you can dial in and look at your home state. See what sort of plan is on offer. Our team does these great annual ratings of 529 plans. I believe the next round of ratings is coming out in November. But it\\'s a really nice distillation of how various plans stack up from the standpoint of investment options and fees. And I\\'m happy to say when we look at the data since we\\'ve been covering 529 plans and certainly other entities have been shining a light on this space as well. We\\'ve seen fees come down. We\\'ve seen investment lineups improve. It\\'s, I think, a fact of life that transparency, shining a light in this space has really helped improve the plans.Dziubinski: And let\\'s talk a little bit about investing those 529 plan assets and the investment choices that you have within a 529 plan. What\\'s your advice there?Benz: My advice is to not overcomplicate this. So, typically 529 plans do offer age-based tracks so you can select the plan that sort of corresponds with your child\\'s age. And the nice thing about that is that those options are really hands-off. So as your child gets closer to college, the plans will typically take risk off the table. And the nice thing is we\\'ve seen 529 plans, the age-based plans, really get religion about the importance of becoming more conservative as that matriculation date draws close. We saw some plans get into trouble during the great financial crisis, more plans have cleaned up their act. So, we\\'re seeing more of these age-based plans really sort of being in sync in terms of being thoroughly derisked at the time that college is upon your child.Dziubinski: Lastly Christine, what are some common mistakes that families make when they\\'re saving for college? What are some things that they should try to avoid doing?Benz: I think a big one is overextending the parents\\' financial situation in an effort to pay for college. I truly get it. I get where parents are coming from in terms of wanting to raid their own coffers to try to make college work. But generally speaking, if you\\'re having to reach into your own Roth IRA or take a home equity loan or take what\\'s called a Parent PLUS loan, which is basically a loan in your own name to pay for your child\\'s education. Those are probably red flags that you are putting your own financial life at jeopardy. I think that\\'s a big risk factor for parents.Dziubinski: Well, Christine, thank you for your time today. It\\'s a really overwhelming topic for parents.Benz: You know.Dziubinski: I know, having just sent our children to college.Benz: Right.Dziubinski: We really appreciate your time and your tips when it comes to this.Benz:Thank you so much, Susan.Dziubinski: I\\'m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

I hope these guidelines will be valuable to others starting their careers or looking for a refresher. Note that while I reference 401(k)s throughout this article, my comments are generally applicable to workers whose employers offer 403(b) or 457 plans instead, which are intended for nonprofit, governmental, and educational institutions.Here are some insights into how 401(k)s work and my top suggestions for getting the most out of yours:What a 401(k) Is, and What It\\'s Not  Although the 401(k) plan wasn\\'t originally designed to be the primary retirement vehicle for U.S. workers, the decline of pension plans since the early 1980s has forced plans like 401(k)s to occupy that role. The key consequence for most new workers is that the heaviest burden of saving for retirement now rests largely on their shoulders. A 401(k) aids in that process by granting you a tax benefit: first by allowing you to defer a portion of your salary before taxes, and second by allowing those savings to compound tax-free. Down the road you will then pay income taxes on the distributions you take. If it\\'s made available by your employer, the newer Roth 401(k) flips that around by taking away that up-front tax benefit but allowing you to take the distributions tax-free later on.Taking the First Step  To borrow from the immortal catchphrase of Star Trek\\'s USS Enterprise Captain Jean-Luc Picard, your first and most important step with respect to a 401(k) is simply to \\\\\"engage\\\\\" with it by signing up for the plan. When it comes to sending a percentage of your paycheck to your 401(k) account, my message is to start with whatever you can afford, even if it\\'s a small percentage--ideally up to the level of your company match.There are several benefits in doing so. One is simply to develop the habit of investing early in your career, which can become second nature and be built upon as your cash flow increases. Another is the power of compounding interest. Although the dollar amounts trickling into your account early on may seem depressingly small, you can look at any number of models to see how the steady accumulation of even small amounts over very long periods of time reaps great rewards. In the past, we\\'ve demonstrated how you could attain a $1 million account balance at age 65 by contributing just a shade over $5,000 per year (including employer matches), if you started at age 22. Delaying your first investment until age 30 would drive up that required annual amount to nearly $9,000. So, it\\'s in your best interest to start early.Learn to Juggle  Many young people are struggling to balance multiple financial goals, including regular expenses, multiple forms of debt payments, and the need to build up an emergency fund. Experts have differing views on how to prioritize managing expenses and debt. My own view is that, to the extent possible, you should try to tackle multiple goals at once.As noted above, if you can start out with making even small contributions to your 401(k), you\\'ll be giving yourself a huge head start. And this sort of financial juggling is something you\\'ll have to do throughout your life. Later on, it may involve saving for an automobile, a house, or a child\\'s tuition, so take advantage of only having to worry about a few things now and establish good habits.If you happen to be working remotely from your parents\\' house right now while saving on rent, travel, and eating out, there\\'s no time like the present to use that extra income to build up your emergency fund and stash more in your 401(k).Raise the Stakes  You may be wondering how much you should invest in your 401(k). It goes without saying, of course, that the more you can invest, the better.Once you\\'ve established that regular contribution habit, there are relatively painless ways to increase your contribution rate over time. One is to sign up for an \\\\\"auto-escalation\\\\\" feature that many plan providers offer, allowing you to automatically raise your contribution rate by a preset amount on a regular schedule--say by 1% or 2% each year.Another option is to commit to lifting your contribution rate by the amount of your raise each year, which will have no effect on your take-home pay. A more advanced move is to devote a higher share of any bonuses you receive to your 401(k), which will help plump up your account value.Mind the Match Another way to compound the effects of your 401(k) contributions is to take advantage of any employer-matching program that might be available. Matches are typically constructed to mirror a certain percentage of your own contributions, up to a given level. For instance, an employer might contribute 50 cents on the dollar up to a 6% deferral rate.In that scenario, let\\'s say you earn a salary of $60,000 per year. If you elect to contribute at the 6% level, that means you\\'ll put in $3,600 of your own money during the year, plus your employer would contribute an additional $1,800. (Keep in mind that you\\'ll also be reducing your taxes because the pretax contributions will lower the income level that you declare to the IRS.)Two things should be called out here, though. First, there is occasionally a brief waiting period of a few weeks before an employee is eligible to participate in these kinds of plans. Second, while your employer may contribute to your 401(k), there will likely also be something called a vesting schedule in place that determines when you gain full ownership of employer contributions. In many cases you won\\'t have access to 100% of your employer\\'s contributions for a couple of years. (Your own contributions are always yours, even if you switch jobs.) Since this is \\\\\"free money\\\\\"--or, more accurately, additional compensation from your employer--most advisors recommend contributing at least up to the level of the employer match to get the biggest possible benefit.5 Ways to Keep Investments Simple  We\\'ve all heard stories about young people opening up Robinhood accounts and day-trading stocks to their hearts\\' content. Let me categorically say that your 401(k) is not the place to take unnecessary risks or get overly complicated. As I\\'ve written in the past, a simple approach to choosing 401(k) investments is often the best.Here are five methods you can use to do just that:1) Consider Target-Date Funds These funds offer a convenient way to invest money that will grow over time and shift your investments from riskier stocks with potentially higher returns to more secure bonds as you get closer to retirement. It\\'s best for you to pick a vintage year closest to when you\\'ll turn 65.2) Consider Index (Passive) Funds These funds track an entire market (the S&P 500, for example) at once. Consider selecting a broad equity index fund or combining a U.S. and international index to have a wider variety of assets working in your favor.3) Avoid Trendy Areas of the Market Don\\'t choose to invest in a fund just because it\\'s had great recent returns, as research shows that markets tend to be heavily mean-reverting. Remember, in retirement, you\\'re playing the long game.4) View Active Funds With Caution Be wary of actively managed mutual funds, which may have higher fees, more erratic performance, and generally require more attention on your part.5) Stick With Your Plan\\'s Options If your plan offers a brokerage window where you can access stocks, exchange-traded funds, and funds not available through your plan, it\\'s best to pretend it doesn\\'t exist. Lock It Up and Throw Away the Key  I\\'m exaggerating for the sake of effect here, but I often think that one of the most helpful steps investors can take is to simply forget the passwords to their accounts, depriving them of the ability to constantly check their balances.If you\\'ve made smart, strategic choices up front, and you have the benefit of a time horizon of 30 to 40 years, there\\'s really no reason to check in on your account on anything more frequent than an annual basis. The quarterly ups and downs of the stock market are irrelevant to your long-term returns, and checking in during a bear market may induce you to panic and make poor, emotionally driven decisions.During that annual check-in, you should make sure that none of your holdings have performed significantly out of line with your expectations. If you\\'ve gone the route of selecting a target-date or index fund, you likely won\\'t have much to do in the way of reallocating. But if you have selected multiple funds from multiple asset classes, you should rebalance if weightings have diverged significantly from your targets. It\\'s also a good time to consider raising your contribution rate if you haven\\'t signed up for an auto-escalation feature.Note that there are ways to gain access to your 401(k) funds prior to retirement, but doing so is generally not recommended. \\\\\"Hardship\\\\\" withdrawals are allowable if you meet certain criteria defined by the IRS, but you will be subject to taxes and penalties.You can also take a loan from your 401(k), which you then repay through additional contributions to your account at a predetermined (usually variable) interest rate. Just know that depleting your 401(k) assets can do serious damage to your long-term investment plan, so you should only consider it under extreme circumstances. (Here\\'s a more detailed list providing 20 common mistakes that investors make with their 401(k)s).Don\\'t Let Your 401(k) Stress You Out  First jobs are a time of anticipation, excitement, and exploration.

This content is part of Morningstar\\\\u2019s Tax and IRA Guide special report.I get this question a lot. Or, rather, it\\'s usually something like, \\\\\"Which is better?\\\\\"Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs both offer tax-advantaged growth of money. The contribution for both account types for 2021 is $6,000, or $7,000 if over age 50. The biggest difference between the account types comes down to when you pay taxes on the money. With that in mind, here is the first question to ask yourself: Do you think you\\'ll be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement than you are now?You\\'ll be forgiven if--like me--you don\\'t really know the answer to this question. But here\\'s the conventional wisdom: If you have reason to believe you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you are now, it might be wise to stick with a traditional IRA (in other words, pay taxes on the money later, when your income tax rate will be lower).Conversely, if you are just starting your career and there\\'s a good chance that you will be in a higher tax bracket later in life, a Roth could be a better choice because you\\'ll pay income tax at your current (lower) tax rate. But there are other considerations, too. If you are on a very tight budget and could really use the tax deduction now, a traditional IRA could be the way to go. Here are some additional questions to help you decide.I Think My Tax Bracket Will Be Higher in Retirement If you think your tax bracket will be higher in retirement than it is now, you might lean toward a Roth IRA. But you need to ask yourself a few more questions to see if you qualify.     Source: Morningstar.Of course, if you really want to open a Roth IRA but you aren\\'t eligible to contribute because your income is too high, you can do a backdoor Roth maneuver. With a Roth IRA, you pay tax now. You contribute to a Roth IRA using aftertax money, and you can\\'t deduct the contribution from your taxable income. But when you do withdraw the money in retirement, it\\'s tax-free.Roth IRA contributions are also subject to certain income limits. A single filer and head of household can make a full contribution if your income is below $125,000 and a partial contribution up to $140,000. For married filing jointly, you can make a full contribution if your income is less than $198,000, and a partial contribution up to $208,000.You can withdraw contributions you made to your Roth IRA anytime, tax- and penalty-free. However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties if you withdraw the earnings in your Roth IRA prior to age 59 1\\\\/2. If you are 59 1\\\\/2 or older but haven\\'t had the account for more than five years, your earnings may be subject to taxes but not penalties.Unlike a traditional IRA, you aren\\'t required to take withdrawals after age 72.I Think My Tax Bracket Will Be Lower in Retirement If you think your tax bracket will probably be lower when you\\'re in retirement than it is now, a traditional deductible IRA might serve you better. But there are some considerations with that, too:     Source: Morningstar.With a traditional IRA, you pay tax later. When you contribute to a traditional IRA, if your income is below certain limits, you may be eligible to deduct the contribution from your adjusted gross income, which means you won\\'t pay tax on it now. Beginning at age 59 1\\\\/2, you can withdraw money from your traditional IRA; at that time, you will pay income taxes on the amount withdrawn.For single filers who are covered by a company retirement plan, you can deduct the full contribution if your modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, is below $66,000, and a partial deduction up to $76,000 ($105,000 and $125,000 for married filing jointly). If your spouse is covered by a retirement plan but you are not, the deduction is phased out between $198,000 and $208,000. If neither you nor your spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you are eligible to take the full deduction.If you withdraw the money before you turn 59 1\\\\/2, you may be subject to a 10% penalty on the withdrawal.Beginning at age 72, you will be required to take taxable withdrawals from your account or you will be subject to a penalty.I Have No Idea What My Tax Bracket Will Be When I Retire! If you don\\\\u2019t know what the future holds--and many people fall into this category!--it\\\\u2019s a tax-savvy idea to split the difference. Contribute to both account types if you can.

You contribute pretax dollars to the account, and your invested money grows tax-free. You can also withdraw money tax-free if you use it for qualified medical expenses. This triple tax benefit makes HSAs a helpful tool with two roles: You can spend money on current healthcare expenses or invest to cover future ones.You also keep your HSA money until you use it, even if you change employers. This portability differentiates an HSA from a flexible spending arrangement, another account that covers healthcare expenses. You usually lose FSA money if you change employers or have any remaining funds after the plan year (with a few exceptions).Do I qualify for an HSA? You have to be enrolled in a health insurance plan that qualifies as a high-deductible health plan. Your deductible is how much you pay before your insurance kicks in\\\\u2014meaning it starts covering part or all of each eligible healthcare expense. For 2022, a high deductible is at least $1,400 for a self-only insurance plan and $2,800 for a family plan. (Note that the IRS regularly adjusts these figures upward for inflation.) Your health insurance plan\\'s out-of-pocket maximum also cannot exceed $7,050 (or $14,100 for family coverage). You also cannot be a dependent on a tax return, enrolled in Medicare, or enrolled in another health insurance plan (unless permitted under other health coverage).What is the maximum HSA contribution for 2022? In 2022, you and your employer can contribute to your HSA, but combined contributions must be at or below $3,650 for a self-only insurance plan and $7,300 for a family plan. If you\\'re over age 55, you can contribute $1,000 more each year.What can I buy with HSA money? You can spend HSA dollars on qualified medical expenses, which generally include dental, vision, and prescription costs. (You can see a full list of qualified medical expenses on the IRS website.) You\\'ll pay a steep 20% penalty and regular income tax on HSA withdrawals used for nonqualified medical expenses, so try contacting your doctor\\'s office if you\\'re unclear whether a healthcare expense qualifies. Where should I open my HSA (and does it impact how I contribute)? If your employer sponsors an HSA that qualifies as a section 125 cafeteria plan, you may want to start your search there. If you elect to defer part of your pretax salary into the employer-sponsored HSA, these contributions (and any employer match) are not subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes. You won\\'t reap this additional tax benefit by contributing aftertax dollars to your HSA (though you can still deduct the contributions from your taxable income when filing income taxes).You might also receive some extra benefits from an employer-sponsored HSA. Your employer might contribute money to your HSA (though you can transfer any funds into another HSA, as Morningstar\\'s director of personal finance Christine Benz has explained). Additionally, some employers cover the HSA fees that you\\'d pay if you opened the HSA on your own.If your employer doesn\\\\u2019t sponsor an account, you can use Morningstar Research to find the best HSAs. Our analysts rate HSAs on various criteria including fees, interest rates, and investment quality\\\\u2014depending on whether you use the account for spending or investing. How should I use my HSA? Many people use their HSAs as spending vehicles\\\\u2014in other words, they use their HSAs to pay for qualifying medical expenses.Others, however, also use their HSAs as investment vehicles if they do not need to use their HSAs to cover medical expenses or if they have more money in their HSAs than they need each year to cover medical costs. If you plan to spend and invest with your HSA, consider keeping at least your deductible amount (or even your maximum-out-of-pocket amount) in cash to cover expenses and invest the rest.Are there any other ways that I can use an HSA? You can use HSA funds in these other ways:As a retirement account: Benz notes that after age 65, you can withdraw HSA money for any purpose and avoid the 20% tax penalty. However, you\\'ll pay regular income tax on withdrawals for nonqualified medical expenses.To pay insurance premiums under COBRA: You generally can\\\\u2019t use HSA money to cover an insurance premium or regular payments for an insurance policy. However, if you lose your job and you keep your insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act\\\\u2019s (COBRA) continuation coverage, you can pay the premium with HSA funds. Using tax-advantaged HSA dollars to pay COBRA premiums is a helpful benefit, because COBRA enrollees are often responsible for paying the entire premium.\",\"Article Author\":\"Michael Schramm\",\"Label\":\"start-investing\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Sep 28, 2021\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" What Does It Take to Have a $1 Million 401(k)?    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/878897\\\\/what-does-it-take-to-have-a-1-million-401k\",\"Article Content\":\"Editor\\'s note: This article originally ran on Sep. 5, 2019. It\\\\u2019s since been updated to reflect new data.Let\\'s say your goal is to save a million dollars by the time you retire. For many people, that sounds like a Herculean task.What are you picturing right now? If you are imagining squirreling away money for decades and holding it in cash (which has returned 0.4% after inflation* over the past 90 years), you would need to sock away a lot of money to get to a million. And along the way, your budget could be really tight. Change your mental picture. Instead, invest in your 401(k) (or another retirement savings account) with the goal of having a million dollars in 30 to 40 years. Although it may sound like it\\'s just semantics, it\\'s actually much easier--especially if you start saving early--to let your investments do as much heavy lifting as possible.What Does It Take? You can contribute up to $19,500 to a 401(k) in 2021. But the good news is that you don\\'t have to save anywhere near that much per year if your goal is to have a million dollars at retirement age (65), provided you start early. The earlier you start investing, the longer your investment will compound (your money will grow exponentially). You can do the math yourself if you have a financial calculator, but in case you don\\'t (or you don\\'t have it handy), here\\'s an example of a 25-year-old who has not yet begun saving.     What about that market rate of return? How do I know what stocks will return over the next 40 years? The truth is I don\\'t, and neither does anyone else. If we did know, we would know exactly how much we need to save to reach our goal. But since we don\\'t, we will make educated guesses instead.Here\\'s how I came up with 7%. Over the past 90 years, stocks (as benchmarked by the S&P 500) have returned about 10% per year on average. Adjusted for inflation (which is referred to as the \\\\\"real\\\\\" return), stocks have gained around 7% per year on average. Does that mean the S&P 500 will earn around 7% after inflation in every year going forward? Of course not--this is just the smoothed-out, average annual return over the past 90 years. Importantly, there is just no accurate way to guess what stocks will do over short-term periods. Over a multidecade period, though, 7% per year is as reasonable an estimate as any. Again, though, there are no guarantees. If you want to be more conservative in your estimate, you can use 6% or 5% as the return for stocks. The result of lowering the growth rate will be that the recommended savings amount rises: In other words, the market won\\'t do as much heavy lifting and you will have to save more. The downside of saving more in the present is that you may have to keep a pretty tight budget, which can be challenging. The upside, obviously, is that you\\'ll have more money saved.Don\\'t forget: Part of your contribution might come from your employer in the form of a company match. Let\\'s say your employer matches the first 5% of your 401(k) contribution at $0.50 on the dollar. That means that if you save at least 5% of your paycheck ($2,000 if your base salary is $40,000), your employer will kick in $1,000. So that means that you only have to save $4,000 per year (10% of your salary) to get into the ballpark you want to be in.Is a Million Going to Be Enough? Now that we\\'ve figured out how to save a million dollars, we should ask ourselves if that\\'s even an appropriate target. It\\'s a considerable amount of money and it\\'s a lot more than many people have when it comes time to retire. But if you have many decades until retirement, inflation takes a toll and you might find that a million dollars just isn\\'t a whole lot of money. The goal in retirement savings and drawdown is to maintain your current lifestyle, plus or minus some expenses--maybe more travel spending but less money required for commuting and new clothing. Many people focus on replacing 80% of their preretirement paycheck. Remember, too, that Social Security will provide some income in retirement. Also--and this is something that people sometimes forget--you still have some earning power in retirement, especially if you maintain a modest allocation to stocks in your portfolio.For that reason, it\\'s recommended that you base your savings goal on your household\\'s anticipated cash flow needs rather than on an arbitrary number. For example, Fidelity periodically releases recommended age-based savings benchmarks expressed in terms of multiples of salary (see this article in Fidelity Viewpoints).     These savings \\\\\"guideposts\\\\\" are Fidelity\\'s, not Morningstar\\'s. I think they they are pretty decent benchmarks. The problem with homing in on a dollar amount is that it might be a lot more or a lot less than you will need in retirement, depending on your current salary and lifestyle.Saving a considerable amount for your retirement isn\\'t impossible. It can be difficult, of course--especially in the early stages of a career when incomes tend to be lower. But hopefully you can afford to sock away $100 to $200 per paycheck. Though for some it may be out of reach, for others it may be more achievable than they thought.* To find rate of return for cash, I used the compound annual growth rate of a T Bill over the period from 1928-2018 (3.4%). (A T Bill is debt instrument backed by the U.S. Treasury that has a maturity of less than one year.) I then used Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI data to come up with a compound growth rate for inflation over the same period (3.0%).\",\"Article Author\":\"Karen Wallace\",\"Label\":\"start-investing\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"May 7, 2021\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" Morningstar\\'s Guide to Stock Investing    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/988220\\\\/morningstars-guide-to-stock-investing\",\"Article Content\":\"At Morningstar, we take an owner-oriented approach to stock investing. What does that mean? When investors buy stocks, we don\\'t think they\\'re just buying tickers or stories. Rather, they\\'re buying partial ownership in companies. As such, we think it\\'s important to understand a company\\'s fundamentals before purchasing its shares.Our approach to stock investing boils down to three basics: having an intimate knowledge of the company\\'s sustainable competitive advantages, determining what its shares are worth, and then only buying the stock when there\\'s a significant margin of safety in doing so.Let\\'s unpack that a bit. We encapsulate our opinion of a company\\'s competitive advantages in the Morningstar Economic Moat Rating. From our perspective, these are the types of companies that are able to effectively fend off competitors and earn high returns on capital for years to come. A company whose competitive advantages we expect to last more than 20 years has a wide moat; one that can fend off their rivals for 10 years has a narrow moat; while a firm with either no advantage or one that we think will quickly dissipate has no moat.Our fair value estimates are our take on what we think a company\\'s shares are worth. We look beyond fleeting metrics, such as a company\\'s recent earnings or any stock price momentum. Rather, we calculate fair value estimates based on how much cash we think a company will generate in the future. Our fair value uncertainty rating--depicted as low, medium, high, very high, or extreme--depicts the level of uncertainty around our fair values estimate, based on things like a company\\'s sales predictability, operating and financial leverage, and exposure to contingent events.Lastly, the Morningstar Rating for stocks indicates whether a stock is undervalued (4 or 5 stars), fairly valued (3 stars), or overvalued (1 and 2 stars) based on where a stock\\'s market price is relative to our fair value estimate, adjusted for uncertainty. This guide takes a deeper dive into our process for evaluating and rating stocks and provides useful insight into how to make the most of our company reports.How to Read a Morningstar Stock Analyst ReportWhat Makes a Moat?The Morningstar Economic Moat RatingThe Morningstar Fair Value Estimate Why Do Stocks\\' Fair Value Estimates Change?The Morningstar Rating for StocksThe Morningstar Rating for Stocks Do\\'s and Don\\'tsHow to Use Morningstar Ratings to Find Quality StocksQuick Definitions: Key Morningstar Terms Economic MoatFair Value EstimateFair Value UncertaintyMorningstar Rating for Stocks\",\"Article Author\":\"Susan Dziubinski\",\"Label\":\"start-investing\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Jun 15, 2020\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" Key Factors for Evaluating Mutual Funds    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/990067\\\\/key-factors-for-evaluating-mutual-funds\",\"Article Content\":\"If you\\'re currently saving for retirement--or looking to get started saving--you might be wondering how to assess the quality of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.There are a few main areas that form the foundation of Morningstar manager research analysts\\' evaluations of funds, known as the Morningstar Medalist ratings. We\\'ll walk you through all these Pillars--Process, People, and Parent--and we\\'ll show you a quick and easy tool you can use to see how your fund picks work together in a portfolio.How Has the Fund Performed? Performance may be the first thing many people look at when evaluating a fund, but it\\'s not the most important consideration and it certainly shouldn\\'t be the only one. For one thing, a fund\\'s trailing returns won\\'t tell you much about what role a fund could play in a portfolio. And they also won\\'t tell you too much about how the fund will perform in the future. By clicking on \\\\\"expanded view\\\\\" on the Performance tab, you can take a closer look at how a fund has performed during different market conditions. The Performance chart also helps you put returns into context by showing performance relative to both a benchmark index and Morningstar Category peers, which are other funds that invest in a similar way.You can find more helpful information on a fund\\'s Risk tab. A fund\\'s Morningstar Risk score can tell you how volatile a fund\\'s returns have been relative to category peers. (A fund must have three years of performance history in order to receive a Risk score.) The score assesses the variations in a fund\\'s monthly returns (with an emphasis on downside variations--the ones that keep investors up at night) in comparison to similar funds. The greater the variation, the larger the Risk score.You can pair a fund\\\\u2019s Risk score with its Morningstar Return score, which is an assessment of the fund\\'s excess return compared with category peers. (Again, funds with less than three years of performance history do not receive a Return score.) Funds with Low Risk scores and High Return scores have earned higher returns than peers while taking on much less risk. You can find a visual representation of how a fund\\'s Risk and Return scores compare to peers on the Risk tab.     What Is the Strategy, and How Well Have the Managers Executed It? Morningstar analysts evaluate a fund\\'s performance in the context of its strategy, and you should, too. When you select a fund, it\\'s important to understand how it invests and what type of performance profile you can expect from it. When you look at the fund\\'s past performance, see if it jibes with what you would expect from the fund\\'s stated objective.For example, you would expect an aggressive growth fund to outperform in strongly rising, growth-favored markets. You would expect a fund that plies a defensive strategy, either by investing in stocks with a more-defensive profile or by allocating a portion of assets to bonds or less-volatile asset classes, to protect capital better during market sell-offs. But that defensive fund might look pretty dull in red-hot markets, and that growth fund probably looks abysmal when stocks take a nosedive. Understanding how funds invest and behave in different markets, as well as the different roles they play in a diversified portfolio, will help you maximize your wealth-building potential. (More on that later.)Morningstar analysts thoroughly evaluate a fund\\'s strategy when they rate a fund\\'s Process, which is one of the three Pillars, along with People and Parent, that determine a fund\\'s Medalist Rating. The ratings, which are a feature of Premium Membership, are forward-looking and express how much conviction our analysts have in a fund\\'s or ETF\\'s ability to outperform its peers in the future. Analysts give higher ratings to funds whose performance objective and investment process (for security selection, risk management, and portfolio construction) are sensible, clearly defined, and repeatable. The process must also have be implemented effectively; in this context, trailing returns can be informative. Who\\'s Running the Fund? You should also give consideration to the team running a fund. This includes not only the managers\\' tenure and demonstrated skill in executing the strategy, but the analyst team supporting those managers.We\\'ve found that mutual funds and ETFs run by high-quality management teams tend to outperform their benchmark and peers. To evaluate an investment\\\\u2019s management team (the People rating), Morningstar analysts assess the fund managers\\\\u2019 and analysts\\\\u2019 experience and ability; their workload; and the depth of direct and indirect resources that support them.Analysts consider other factors, too, such as whether fund managers invest alongside investors and whether their pay incentives are aligned with investors\\\\u2019 interests. Prospective investors can check publicly available SEC filings to see how much each fund manager has invested in the fund; this is a way to ascertain whether the managers\\' interests are truly aligned with shareholders\\'.The parent fund company\\'s behavior also matters. Morningstar analysts ask a lot of questions to determine whether a fund company is a good steward of investor capital (the Parent rating). For example, is the fund firm dominated by a sales culture or an investment culture? Does the company often launch funds in hot-performing sectors of the market, whether or not they have demonstrated investment expertise in the style? Does the fund company have a history of closing strategies after a periods of strong returns and frothy inflows? Fund closures can be a sign of a shareholder-friendly fund parent--one that doesn\\'t prioritize asset-gathering at the cost of sacrificing current shareholders\\' future returns.How Much Does It Cost? Price is one of the best predictors of a fund\\'s future returns. That\\'s because a fund\\'s costs come right off the top of its total return.As explained in this article, you can use Morningstar to check a fund\\'s price and see whether it\\'s a good deal relative to other funds that invest the same way.

But selecting good investments is only one part: Investors should also pay attention to overall portfolio diversification and not take on too much risk by being too heavily concentrated in any one area.How the investments correlate with one another is another consideration. Modern portfolio theory says that investors can maximize their return potential and reduce the risk of losses by combining investments in asset classes that are not perfectly correlated with one another. A combination of investments like this is likely to do reasonably well in a variety of environments, because as one asset is falling, another is likely rising. Once an optimal asset allocation is established, it\\'s often advisable to rebalance back to the target allocations every so often and to reduce exposure to risky assets like stocks and stock funds as retirement approaches. Whereas early on investors are focused on growing their wealth, as they approach retirement the focus shifts to preserving it.These tasks are not impossible; certainly many investors manage their own portfolios and do it quite well. But there are a great many savers who would prefer to outsource the tasks of portfolio assembly, rebalancing, and gradually making their asset allocation more conservative. That\\'s where target-date funds come in: They do all this for you.What Is a Target-Date Fund? A target-date fund is made up of other funds. The underlying funds offer diversified exposure to a mix of asset classes such as stocks (large caps as well as small\\\\/mid-caps), foreign stocks, bonds, foreign bonds, and maybe a small portion of cashlike securities. They are designed to be held throughout a person\\'s lifetime, and the asset mix shifts dynamically, becoming less risky over a person\\'s working career and into retirement. These funds achieve this by rebalancing portfolios over time to become less focused on growth (lowering their allocation to stocks) and more focused on preservation (raising their allocation to bonds) as the fund approaches and passes the target date. (The year in the fund\\'s name corresponds approximately to the investor\\'s retirement date.) Target-date funds have become very popular: Investors had more than $3 trillion in target-date strategies by the end of 2021. One reason is that the Department of Labor\\'s Pension Protection Act of 2006 designated these funds as a Qualified Default Investment Alternative within 401(k) retirement plans, which are investment vehicles into which plan sponsors are allowed to place participants who do not make their own investment election.But their popularity also owes to their relative ease of ownership--they are truly hands-off investments that offer a diversified portfolio of building blocks with professionally managed allocations and automatic adjustments.What to Look For Although you may be limited by your plan choices, there are many characteristics that Morningstar pays attention to when we evaluate target-date funds. Here are some things to look for. Low fees Unlike buying a luxury car, paying a high price for an investment doesn\\'t guarantee you a better ride. It\\'s important to pay attention to the overall cost of the target-date fund. Some providers layer on fees, and the resulting price tag represents not only the blended costs of the underlying funds but also a layer of management fees that the advisor charges to implement the asset-allocation glide path. Look for low fees. (Note that the funds that are closer to their target retirement date will tend to be less expensive overall than later-dated options because their asset mix starts to tilt away from higher-priced equity fare and toward lower-priced fixed-income options.)For instance, Silver-rated Vanguard Target Retirement Series charges just 0.08%. The portfolio is made up of low-cost index funds, and Vanguard does not charge a management fee to handle the dynamic asset-allocation piece for investors. Also, target-date funds built around index funds tend to be cheaper than those built around actively managed funds. According to Morningstar\\'s target-date landscape report, the average asset-weighted expense ratio for target-date funds was 0.34% at the end of 2021.Asset mix that suits risk tolerance Some target-date funds invest more aggressively than others. Funds in the BlackRock LifePath Index series have an equity allocation approaching 97% for investors targeting retirement around 2060, while JPMorgan SmartRetirement has an equity stake of 85%--nearly 12 percentage points lower--for its similarly dated fund.Investors can also drill down to the underlying exposure to foreign stocks (maybe your risk tolerance doesn\\'t jibe with having a big stake in emerging markets, for instance) or fixed income (perhaps you would prefer to avoid high-yield bonds).Check out the Portfolio tab on Morningstar.com\\'s fund quote pages. There you will find statistics about the fund\\'s portfolio.A glide path that makes sense The rate at which a target-date fund adjusts its allocations to stocks and fixed income over time is known as its glide path. Check to see how the fund invests over time and ramps down its equity exposure as retirement nears. Some invest more heavily in stocks throughout the life of the fund in the belief that a higher equity position--and the higher returns that typically come along with stocks--is necessary to ensure that investors don\\'t outlive their savings.Morningstar analysts can help you evaluate a fund\\'s glide path and allocation. The Fund Analysis section contains a thorough evaluation of the fund\\'s merits and drawbacks and our analysts\\' overall rating. (The Fund Analysis section and Morningstar Analyst Rating are features of Premium Membership. You can sign up here for a free trial.)The Fund Analysis is divided into six sections. Each analysis begins with a Summary, in which the analyst provides a summary of their overall opinion, which often discusses the most important or decisive factors leading to the fund\\'s overall rating. In the sections that follow, the analyst provides an evaluation of how well a fund scores in three fundamental areas (or Pillars): Process, People, and Parent. A fund\\'s overall rating is heavily influenced by the qualitative scores our analysts assign to these three pillars.One-Size-Fits-Most For many investors, target-date funds make a lot of sense, but they may not work for everyone. Outside of initially picking the fund, they don\\'t offer investors control over their investment or allocation choices. Also, by choosing a target-date vehicle, investors are limited to a given fund family\\'s funds; most target-date funds use their own underlying funds to build portfolios. The drawback of that is that few fund companies offer best-of-breed funds across all asset classes.In addition, they are intended to be used on their own. If satellite holdings are added--perhaps to add exposure to market sectors not represented in the target-date fund\\'s portfolio--investors must take on part of the rebalancing task by recalculating the asset allocation of the entire retirement portfolio to make sure it\\'s in line with targets. (Morningstar.com\\'s Portfolio Instant X-Ray tool can help.)Those caveats aside, target-date funds offer a great proposition for most retirement savers. They are no doubt the easiest path to setting up a diversified portfolio and maintaining a sensible asset allocation for decades.\",\"Article Author\":\"Karen Wallace\",\"Label\":\"start-investing\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Mar 11, 2022\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\" What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund?    \",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/952709\\\\/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund\",\"Article Content\":\"Editor\\'s note: This article originally ran on Nov. 19, 2020. It\\\\u2019s since been updated to reflect new data.ETFs (or exchange-traded funds) are hybrid investment vehicles that can offer relatively low-cost and tax-efficient exposure to a variety of asset classes and investment strategies. Like traditional mutual funds, most ETFs invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs trade on a stock exchange.The majority of ETFs are passively managed, which means they track an index. That said, a growing minority of them are actively managed. Irrespective of whether they are tracking an index or delivering an active strategy, ETFs tend to have lower annual expenses relative to mutual funds. That said, because they trade like stocks, investors should account for transaction costs (commissions, bid-ask spreads, and so on). ETFs are often lauded for their tax efficiency compared with traditional mutual funds. There are two main reasons ETFs are often more tax-efficient. First, most ETFs are index funds. And index funds, especially large-cap index funds or total-market index funds that are weighted by market cap, have fairly low turnover. Low turnover means fewer opportunities to realize gains when securities are sold from the portfolio. ETFs\\' structure is the second, more important driver of their tax efficiency. ETF shares are created and destroyed via in-kind transactions between ETFs\\' sponsors and a special kind of market maker known as an authorized participant. As such, ETFs tend not to have to directly sell positions from their portfolios to meet redemptions, which protects investors from taxable capital gains distributions.Investors should be aware that tax-efficient doesn\\'t mean tax-free, though. The primary benefit of ETFs from a tax perspective is that they can allow investors to defer the realization of capital gains taxes. Investors in ETFs will still pay taxes on regular distributions of income, and they will also pay capital gains taxes when they sell an ETF for more than they paid for it. Also, some ETFs will distribute capital gains, though they tend to be less frequent and of lesser magnitude than those their mutual fund counterparts generate.How to Find the Best ETFs Morningstar Analyst Ratings can help you identify topnotch ETFs in nearly every asset class. Our analysts carefully evaluate exchange-traded funds, paying particular attention to the fund\\'s process; they tend to favor ETFs that are very broadly diversified, low-cost, and sponsored by solid parent firms. The ETFs that attract the most investor dollars tend to be in \\\\\"core\\\\\" categories such as large-cap equity, foreign large-cap equity, and intermediate-term core bond, which are often used as the main building blocks of investors\\' portfolios. Encouragingly, many of the 10 largest ETFs by net assets are among those rated highly by Morningstar analysts for their broad diversification, low fees, and demonstrated ability to efficiently track a well-constructed index.     We assign positive (Morningstar Medalist) ratings to ETFs that we believe can outperform the median fund in the Morningstar Category, after fees. The ETFs we expect to outperform by the widest margin are rated Gold; our next-highest conviction picks are rated Silver, followed by Bronze.We hold ETFs that fall under the heading of strategic- or smart-beta to a different (higher) standard. At Morningstar, we think of strategic-beta ETFs as index funds that make active bets: They are linked to indexes that focus on one or more factors--such as value, momentum, or low volatility, in an effort to improve their returns or alter their risk profiles relative to traditional market benchmarks. Because of this, we require strategic-beta funds to surpass a tougher hurdle: They need to convince us they can beat the category index after fees (not the median fund in the category). Our assessment of process is the most important consideration behind the rating for these funds.We also assign Analyst Ratings to a number of actively managed ETFs. We put these funds through the same paces as we do actively managed mutual funds, while paying close attention to how the potential constraints of delivering an active strategy in the ETF format might affect the management team\\'s process.

On paper, Buffett\\\\u2019s investment strategy is pretty simple:Buy businesses, not stocks. In other words, think like a business owner, not someone who owns a piece of paper (or these days, a digital trade confirmation).Look for companies with competitive advantages that can be maintained, or economic moats. Firms that can successfully fend off competitors have a better chance of increasing intrinsic value over time.Focus on long-term intrinsic value, not short-term earnings. What matters is how much cash a company can generate for its owners in the future. Therefore, value companies using a discounted cash flow analysis.Demand a margin of safety. Future cash flows are, by their nature, uncertain. To compensate for that uncertainty, always buy companies for less than their intrinsic values.Be patient.

If you have years or decades to invest, as many beginning investors do, you can invest in stocks and see your dollars multiply over the time period.But you might wonder whether you should buy individual stocks or an equity fund, which is a basket of stocks. While it doesn\\\\u2019t have to be an either\\\\/or decision forever, beginning investors are often better starting with funds because they offer some conveniences. We take a closer look at why and give some advice on how to choose a fund.Diversification Is a Fund\\'s Main Benefit One risk of holding only a handful of individual stocks is that if a few failed, it could have a big impact on your overall return. This is called unsystematic or business risk; it\\'s the chance that company-specific issues like poor management or lawsuits could cause a stock\\'s price to permanently plummet. The good news is that you can eliminate this risk by owning many companies, which is called diversifying. When you diversify by owning many stocks, the performance of the overall portfolio would be only minimally affected by a few poor performers. As most funds have dozens (or hundreds) of holdings, you can diversify away unsystematic risk with just one fund in many cases. For many beginning investors, that shortcut is a huge advantage compared with buying and researching individual stocks.You might also benefit from other diversification shortcuts that funds offer. There are also risks if you concentrate your portfolio in a specific sector or geography because that area may perform poorly and hamper your returns. With mutual funds, the portfolio often contains companies across sectors; if you add an international fund or two, you can easily own companies from around the globe (this also spreads your bets across more currencies).However, diversification comes with a drawback: It lessens the impact of high-performing stocks, which some investors might seek. But as Alex Bryan discusses, it\\\\u2019s difficult to beat the market, and you face even more difficulty if you\\\\u2019re just learning the ropes. Many beginners will find that diversification\\\\u2019s downside protection outweighs losing out on the small chance of sky-high returns. Using Morningstar Research to Choose a Fund While a fund can offer shortcuts, beginning investors must still perform meaningful due diligence to find the right pick(s).If you\\'re looking for some help, you can use Morningstar\\'s research. We assign many funds a Morningstar Analyst Rating, which expresses our confidence in whether a fund can beat or mirror its benchmark\\'s return going forward depending on whether it\\'s an active or passive strategy (more on that difference later). For funds that our analysts like, we assign Bronze, Silver, and Gold medalist ratings, with Gold expressing our highest level of conviction.  Evaluating and Choosing the Right Fund(s) for You You might notice that Morningstar awards Medalist ratings to hundreds of funds in many different Morningstar Categories. As a first step, you\\'ll need to determine what type of fund you\\'re looking for. One area of the market investors often use for core stock exposure is the large-cap blend category, which contains large, multinational businesses across many different market sectors. For core foreign-stock exposure, many investors opt for funds in the foreign-stock large-blend categories. Another option is a target-date fund, which contains various underlying funds that combined can satisfy an investor\\'s diversification needs. You can use Morningstar research to find a topnotch choice in your preferred area(s) of the market. That\\'s because Morningstar analysts rank funds relative to peers in their Morningstar Category, or Morningstar-created peer groups that cluster together similar types of funds. If you choose a Gold-rated U.S. large-blend fund, you know that our analysts have high conviction in that fund relative to other large-blend funds.Once you\\'ve zeroed in on a category or two, you\\\\u2019ll need to carefully consider your preferences and circumstances to determine the best fund for your needs. Here are some key considerations:Active or Passive You\\'ll have to decide whether you want a passive or active fund. A passive fund\\'s goal is to replicate the return of a designated market segment, and an active fund seeks to outperform the market segment.Why would an investor choose a fund that won\\\\u2019t beat the market, you might ask? Many active fund managers underperform in the pursuit of beating the market (and active funds tend to charge higher fees), which can make the average return of passive investments appealing. (For more on the decision, see \\\\\"What Is Passive Investing?\\\\\")Traditional Mutual Fund or ETF You\\'ll also have to decide whether you want a traditional mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund, which is a fund that trades on a stock exchange. ETFs are typically passive investments, which means they track an index.Beginning investors won\\\\u2019t notice many huge differences between traditional mutual funds and ETFs, so they can usually choose either (or a mix of both). One notable difference that Ben Johnson highlights is that ETFs have a tax-efficient structure, so you might prefer an ETF if you\\\\u2019re in a taxable account.Costs You\\'ll want to carefully consider a fund\\'s costs because every penny paid in fees is a penny that\\'s no longer available for you to invest. It\\'s easy to find a fund\\'s costs using Morningstar.com quote pages. Here\\'s how:Enter the ticker (1) of the share class you want to invest in to pull up its Quote page.Look for the fund\\'s expense ratio (2), or the annual fee that covers various costs, including the costs associated with managing the fund and selecting investments; administrative costs; and fees associated with brokers that facilitate the purchase and sale of funds.To put the expense ratio into context, you can also check the fund\\'s Fee Level (3), which compares the fund\\'s fees against those charged by category peers.You can also see whether the fund has a load (4), or sales charge.     Investment Minimum Many mutual funds have an investment minimum (5), which is the least amount of money a fund will accept to establish a new account. Some funds have $0 minimums, while others can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars for share classes that are available to individual investors. (If you\\'re unsure what a share class is, see Karen Wallace\\'s How to Choose Among Fund Share Classes.)If you require a small investment minimum, you do have some options:Some funds have a $0 investment minimum, so you could choose only funds that meet these criteria.You can buy most ETFs for a specified price that\\'s usually a few hundred dollars at most.You can gain access to funds for less than the investment minimum in many employer-sponsored retirement plans, like a 401(k).\",\"Article Author\":\"Michael Schramm\",\"Label\":\"start-investing\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"May 21, 2020\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How Much Should I Have in My 401(k)?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/articles\\\\/1129518\\\\/how-much-should-i-have-in-my-401k\",\"Article Content\":\"If you ask any Morningstar specialist for advice, they\\\\u2019ll tell you to save early and save often.

Once you pay off the highest interest-rate debt, move onto the next highest one.Debt snowball: List your debts from smallest to biggest, make minimum payments on all the debts, and throw the extra cash on the smallest balance. Once you pay that one off, move onto the next debt, and keep building up the snowball until everything is paid off.Develop a plan that works best for you and your situation with these steps.Can I Take a Loan From My 401(k)?What Is a 401(k) Catch-Up Contribution?If you\\\\u2019re 50 or older, you\\\\u2019re eligible for a catch-up contribution.

Resources like these can help you realize that investing doesn\\\\u2019t have to be intimidating or complicated. Here are the best investing books for beginners that are great places to get started.Prefer podcasts? This list has you covered.1. The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing, by Benjamin GrahamBenjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing. He taught Warren Buffett, a modern investing icon. His book lays a framework for evaluating a business\\\\u2019 worth based on financial value, not short-term trading techniques. In his book, Graham defined many important investing concepts such as \\\\u201cmargin of safety,\\\\u201d which is an important input in the Morningstar Rating for stocks. The revised edition includes commentary from The Wall Street Journal\\'s personal-finance columnist Jason Zweig that contextualizes and modernizes the text. With Zweig\\'s commentary on every chapter, the book is north of 500 pages, which is a lot; however, it\\'s a thorough introduction to investing. If getting through means skimming a few chapters, no judgment here.2. A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, by Burton MalkielIf Graham teaches you how to evaluate a business, Burton Malkiel explains why that might not help you. The Princeton economist argues that markets demonstrate efficiency because people are analyzing a company\\\\u2019s value. (Efficiency means a company\\\\u2019s share price reflects its current worth, and its price will change when new information alters a business\\\\u2019 worth.) Malkiel recommends earning the market\\\\u2019s return instead of beating it, which he compellingly argues is good enough. The book was first published in 1973, but updated editions have added contemporary topics. These include exchange-traded funds and investment techniques like smart beta (which Morningstar prefers to call \\\\\"strategic beta,\\\\\" but I digress).3. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns, by John BogleInvesting icon John Bogle died on Jan. 16, 2019, but he left behind an impressive legacy: He revolutionized the mutual fund industry and was a tireless advocate for investors. He pioneered the index fund, which allowed investors to gain diversified exposure to the stock market at a very low cost, helping them keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets. His book explains why low fees significantly affect returns. It also addresses topics like mean-reversion and tax costs. The text is accessible and shorter than many other investing books, and it includes quotes from many prominent financial figures who support Bogle\\'s claims.4. Morningstar\\\\u2019s 30-Minute Money Solutions: A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your Finances, by Christine BenzEven if you understand investing basics, you might struggle to incorporate them into your personal finances. Executing them in manageable steps can prove even more challenging.That\\'s the beauty of this book. Christine Benz, Morningstar\\'s director of personal finance, breaks financial planning down into bite-size chunks that anyone can handle. You start with basics like assessing your net worth and creating an organization system, and you progressively conquer more advanced topics including retirement investing, college savings, and estate planning.If you want to meld investment basics with tangible advice, this book is a great option.5. The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, by Warren BuffettMany consider Warren Buffett to be the best modern investor. He has risen to fame as Berkshire Hathaway\\\\u2019s CEO, a position he\\\\u2019s held for over 50 years. Berkshire Hathaway invests in high-quality businesses with strong growth potential. But Buffett only buys such companies when they\\\\u2019re selling at an attractive margin of safety (hat tip to his mentor, Benjamin Graham). This makes Buffett an extreme stock-picker. Under his reign, Berkshire Hathaway\\\\u2019s growth has far surpassed that of the S&P 500, a testament to the success of his approach.Each year, Buffett writes an annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, and all of them are published on the company\\'s website, so anyone can read them. Buffett writes in a straightforward style that is accessible to investors of all skill levels, and he\\'s often very funny to boot. \\\\\"The Essays of Warren Buffett\\\\\" weaves together Buffett\\'s essays into a sequential, cohesive book.12 Lessons on Money and More From Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger6. The Bogleheads\\\\u2019 Guide to Investing, by Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, and Michael LeBoeufThe advice of The Vanguard Group founder John Bogle is echoed in this comprehensive guide for investors of all experience levels. Packaged into 23 short, light-hearted chapters, this book contains practical advice and explores many aspects of investing, from how to choose the financial lifestyle that fits you to how to balance your emotions to truly master your investments. This guide also provides external resources and other information for readers who want to dive deeper into any of the topics that the longtime Bogleheads cover. A second edition of the book was released in 2014 and includes updated chapters on tax law changes, 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans, and backdoor Roth IRAs.The Bogleheads are investing enthusiasts who honor Bogle and his advice, living by a philosophy to \\\\\"emphasize starting early, living below one\\'s means, regular saving, broad diversification, simplicity, and sticking to one\\'s investment plan regardless of market conditions.\\\\\" Members actively discuss financial news and theory in a forum.7. I Will Teach You to Be Rich, by Ramit SethiAdvisor and The New York Times best-selling author Ramit Sethi outlines a six-week program for 20- to 35-year-olds to learn the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing. Sethi shares his strategies for eliminating student loans and debt; finding a balance with saving and spending every month; and preparing to purchase a house or car. In the newest edition, he includes stories from readers and insights on the psychology of investing. Sethi strives to demonstrate to investors how to make investments that grow with them and their goals, and how they can spend their money on the things they want without feeling guilty.Our Favorite Best Investing BooksStill have room on your shelf?

These funds\\\\u2014which combine major asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash in a single package\\\\u2014can be a great way to start investing. And even if you already have an established portfolio, an allocation fund could be a logical addition thanks to this fund type\\\\u2019s built-in diversification and simplicity.In this series on portfolio basics, I\\\\u2019ll explain some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\\\\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are Allocation Funds?Allocation funds invest in more than one asset class. There are two major varieties. First, some allocation funds aim for a risk level that remains relatively static. Morningstar classifies these funds into six main categories, ranging from conservative to aggressive. In practice, these classifications mainly reflect the level of underlying equity exposure, which ranges from about 12%, on average, for conservative-allocation funds to 90% for aggressive-allocation funds.Second, target-date funds provide diversified exposure to stocks, bonds, and cash for investors saving up for retirement on a specific target date. These funds automatically adjust their asset mix to become more conservative as the target date approaches, following a preset glide path. Morningstar currently has several target-date fund categories, with future target dates ranging from 2025 to 2065. There are also several categories with target dates that are in the past (for investors who are already retired) or for funds that are geared toward retirees in general (without a specific target date). As shown in the chart below, target-date funds typically start with heavier equity exposure for investors with many years left until retirement, gradually reducing their level of equity exposure to about 44% of assets at the retirement date. After retirement, the equity allocation continues to gradually decrease.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAverage Target-Date Asset Mix Over Time\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in Allocation Funds?The main advantage of allocation funds is their simplicity. Because they\\\\u2019re already diversified across asset classes, investors don\\\\u2019t have to cobble together individual funds to put together a diversified portfolio. And in practice, Morningstar\\\\u2019s research on investor returns has consistently found that allocation funds are among the easiest types of funds to use, meaning that investors in allocation funds don\\\\u2019t typically make bad trading decisions and are therefore able to keep a larger portion of returns.Because most allocations include both stocks and bonds, they generally provide middle-of-road risk and returns.As mentioned above, though, their risk level mainly depends on the level of equity exposure. The level of risk spans a wide range. The standard deviation for conservative-allocation funds over the past 10 years, for example, has been just slightly higher than that of bonds. At the other end of the spectrum, aggressive-allocation funds have been nearly as volatile as stocks.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTrailing 10-Year Risk and Returns: Allocation Funds and Other Assets\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. Drawdown risk for allocation funds also spans a wide range. As shown in the table below, aggressive-allocation funds have lost as much as 25% over the past 10 years, while conservative-allocation funds had more-limited losses of about 14%. Both returns reflect performance during the bear market that started in January 2022. Even though the market has reversed course since then, none of the categories below had quite made up all of their losses as of Aug. 31, 2023. The reason? While diversifying a portfolio across both stocks and bonds usually helps limit losses, that formula didn\\\\u2019t work in 2022 as rising interest rates and stubbornly high inflation roiled both stocks and bonds.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tOther Risk and Drawdown Stats (Since Sept. 1, 2013)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. How to Invest in Allocation FundsAs the wide range of drawdown risk highlights, it\\\\u2019s important to consider your time horizon and level of risk tolerance before homing in on a specific type of allocation fund. Expenses are another important consideration. Because most allocation funds are funds of funds (meaning they invest in other mutual funds or exchange-traded funds), they have two layers of fees: the expenses for the fund itself, plus the cost of the underlying funds they invest in. For example, Allspring Asset Allocation EAAFX has an expense ratio of 1.04%, but its underlying holdings have additional expenses averaging about 0.57%. Taxes are another thing to consider. Because most allocation funds hold a portion of their portfolios in bonds, they\\\\u2019re typically not the most tax-efficient. This makes them better holdings for a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or IRA, where taxable distributions won\\\\u2019t lead to a higher tax bill. If you\\\\u2019re looking for an allocation fund for a taxable account, consider a tax-managed offering such as Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced VTMFX.Most allocation funds are active to some extent, in the sense that they actively shift their mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes. But funds that invest in passively managed underlying funds will generally have lower costs overall. The most active type of allocation funds\\\\u2014tactical allocation funds\\\\u2014have a terrible track record as a whole. I\\\\u2019d avoid them.When Do Allocation Funds Perform Best?Allocation funds are designed to provide diversification and simplicity, not to maximize returns. As a result, they typically won\\\\u2019t outperform other types of funds in any given year. In risk-adjusted terms, though, allocation funds fare best when both stocks and bonds are generating positive returns. They also perform best during periods when the correlation between stocks and bonds is negative, which reduces risk at the portfolio level. How Long Should I Hold My Investment in An Allocation Fund?The answer to this question depends on the type of allocation fund you\\\\u2019re holding. If you\\\\u2019re using a target-date fund to save up for retirement, you\\\\u2019ll want to hold it at least until the specified target retirement date. Most target-date funds these days are designed to allocate their assets up until the retirement date and beyond, so you can continue holding them even after you\\\\u2019re retired.For other types of allocation funds, Morningstar\\\\u2019s Role in Portfolio framework recommends the minimum holding periods shown in the table below.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMinimum Recommended Time Horizon for Selected Allocation Categories\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. We came up with these guidelines mainly by looking at the average level of equity exposure within each category. The higher the equity exposure, the greater the chance of incurring a loss over shorter periods. To minimize the odds that an investment is in the red when you need to access the money to fund a goal, it makes sense to plan a longer holding period for allocation funds with higher levels of equity exposure.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Allocation Funds?The answer to this question partly depends on how simple you want to keep your portfolio. If you want to keep things super-simple, allocation funds can be a one-and-done solution, especially if you\\\\u2019re saving for retirement. In fact, Morningstar\\\\u2019s Role in Portfolio framework considered allocation funds to be the only type of fund suitable as a stand-alone holding that makes up the entirety of a portfolio.If you don\\\\u2019t mind a little more complexity, you could dedicate your retirement assets to a single allocation fund (such as a target-date fund) and hold other types of investments (such as dedicated stock and bond funds) in another type of account.What Are the Best Allocation Funds?The table below shows a few highly rated allocation funds in various categories. About half of these are funds of funds that employ index funds as their underlying holdings, while the remainder, including American Funds American Balanced ABALX, Vanguard Wellington VWELX, and Vanguard Wellesley Income VWINX, are actively managed portfolios that invest directly in stocks and bonds.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA Few Highly Rated Allocation Funds\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of August 31, 2023. What Funds Pair Well With Allocation Funds?As I mentioned above, you don\\\\u2019t necessarily need to add other funds if you\\\\u2019re already holding an allocation fund. But if you already hold an allocation fund in a tax-deferred account, you could consider adding more specialized funds, such as funds we consider core holdings or building blocks, to a taxable account.Are Allocation Funds a Good Investment?My answer to this question is unequivocal: yes. Allocation funds give you built-in portfolio diversification, thereby solving one of the most difficult parts of investing for many people. Their simplicity also helps investors avoid many of the major pitfalls of building portfolios, such as buying into popular asset classes at the wrong time and failing to choose the right mix of assets for their goals.\",\"Article Author\":\"Amy Arnott\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Oct 2, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"It\\\\u2019s Too Soon to Say the Value Premium Is Dead\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/portfolios\\\\/its-too-soon-say-value-premium-is-dead\",\"Article Content\":\"The underperformance of U.S. value stocks since the Great Recession has received much attention from the financial media, and prompted at least some investors to conclude that value investing is dead. That has led to papers being written, such as AQR\\\\u2019s May 2020 article, \\\\u201cIs (Systematic) Value Investing Dead?\\\\u201d Because the value premium has been much larger in small stocks than in large, we\\\\u2019ll review the performance of small-value stocks compared with broad market indexes. From 2008 through July 2023, while the S&P 500 returned 9.8% per year, the Fama-French small-value research portfolio returned 8.6%, an underperformance of 1.2 percentage points annually. (Fama-French data is from Ken French\\\\u2019s website.)A Cautionary TaleWe heard the same argument about the death of the value premium in 2000. From 1994 to 1999, the S&P 500 returned 23.6%, annually outperforming the Fama-French small-value research portfolio by 7.2 percentage points. However, the declaration of the death of the value premium was premature. From 2000 to 2007, while the S&P 500 returned 1.7%, the Fama-French small-value research portfolio returned 16.2%, outperforming by 14.5 percentage points annually. Such performance should be a cautionary tale for those declaring the death of value.If the underperformance of the value premium in U.S. stocks since 2008 was a sign that value was dead, we should see similar underperformance outside the U.S. From 2008 through July 2023, the MSCI EAFE Index returned 3.2%, but the Dimensional International Small Cap Value Index returned 5.2%, outperforming by 2.0 percentage points annually. In emerging markets, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 1.7%, the Dimensional Emerging Markets Targeted Value Index returned 4.1%, outperforming by 2.4 percentage points. Thus, outside the U.S., investors who diversified their portfolios to include small-value stocks benefited. We can now examine how a globally diversified small-value-oriented portfolio performed over this 15-year-plus period relative to a market-based portfolio. Roughly allocating to the global market capitalization, we can assign a 50% weighting to U.S. stocks, a 37.5% weighting to non-U.S. developed stocks, and a 12.5% weighting to emerging-markets stocks. This hypothetical, globally diversified, market-based portfolio with those weights would have returned 5.84% annually, underperforming the return of 6.33% of a globally diversified small-value portfolio. And this was perhaps the worst 15-year period for value stocks, ending with the spread in valuations between growth and value stocks being about as wide as they were at the end of the dot-com boom\\\\u2014which foreshadowed the largest outperformance ever for small-value stocks.It\\\\u2019s All About ValuationsWhile all crystal balls are cloudy (we cannot know the future), valuations are the best predictor we have of future returns. And small-value stocks are trading at historically cheap valuations relative to their market counterparts, indicating the likelihood of a large premium going forward. The table below shows the relative valuations of Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF AVUV and Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF AVDV, along with Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF AVES, compared with Vanguard\\\\u2019s broad market index funds, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VTSMX, Vanguard Developed Markets Index VTMGX, and Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index VEIEX.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tValuations of Selected Indexes\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      The increase in relative valuations has left the value spread at historically high levels. That raises the question: Does the value spread contain information about future returns? To answer that question, Avantis examined the historical data from Dec. 31, 1979, to Dec. 31, 2019. The table below shows the subsequent five-year return difference between value and growth when the valuation spread is below the median and above the median. It makes clear that the valuation spread does contain information about future returns\\\\u2014the future value premium tends to be much higher after periods when the valuation spread is above the median spread\\\\u2014and it is well above the median today.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMonthly Valuation Spreads\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Investor TakeawaysWhile there are no crystal balls, there doesn\\\\u2019t seem to be any strong evidence that the value premium is dead. The poor recent performance has been due to changes in what John Bogle called the \\\\u201cspeculative return\\\\u201d (the change in relative valuations). In support of this idea, consider the following.Let\\\\u2019s go back in time to the end of 2016 and ask if the value premium was dead based on the out-of-sample returns (after the publication of the original Fama-French research on the value premium) over the 25-year period 1992 through 2016. During this period, the Russell 1000 Growth Index returned 8.2% per year, underperforming the Russell 1000 Value Index return of 10.1% per year, or by 1.9 percentage points; and the Russell 2000 Growth Index returned 7.4% per year, underperforming the Russell 2000 Value Index, which returned 11.5% per year, by 4.1 percentage points. The annual average value premium was 4.5%, not much different from the 5.1% premium for the period 1927 through 1991. I don\\\\u2019t think anyone would have declared the value premium dead based on those figures. Yet, just a few years later, we hear a clarion cry that the publication of the Fama-French research and cash flows have killed the value premium. Does anyone seriously believe that 25 years was not enough time for publication of the research to kill the premium, but just a few more years did the trick? And if cash flows had killed the premium, 25 years of them should have been enough to accomplish the task.In addition, as David Blitz demonstrated in his study \\\\u201cAre Exchange-Traded Funds Harvesting Factor Premiums?,\\\\u201d while some ETFs are specifically designed for harvesting factor premiums, such as the size, value, momentum, and low-volatility premiums, other ETFs implicitly go against those factors. Specifically, Blitz found that \\\\u201cfrom a factor investing perspective, smart-beta ETFs tend to provide the right factor exposures, while conventional ETFs tend to be on the other side of the trade with the wrong factor exposures. In other words, these two groups of investors are essentially betting against each other.\\\\u201d Despite what many investors believe, there has not been a massive net inflow into value stocks relative to growth stocks.The Comfortable Path or the Diversified One?The takeaway is that investors face a choice. They can either own a traditional 60% market-like equity\\\\/40% bond portfolio, which has most of its risk (as much as 90% or more depending on the maturity and quality of the bond holdings) concentrated in the single factor of market beta, or they can choose to diversify across as many unique sources of risk and return as they can identify that meet all their established criteria. The first path is the comfortable one in the sense that the portfolio will not cause any tracking error regret\\\\u2014investors won\\\\u2019t be underperforming popular benchmarks that are reported on a daily basis by the financial media. On the other hand, that strategy will likely be highly uncomfortable during periods like 1973-74, 2000-02, and 2008, when the single factor (market beta) that dominates their portfolio\\\\u2019s risk suffers from severe bear markets (and also over long periods, such as the 15-year period 1929-43, the 17-year period 1966-82, and the 13-year period 2000-12, when the S&P 500 underperformed riskless one-month Treasury bills).With that said, failing conventionally is always easier than failing unconventionally (misery loves company). And while based on the historical mean and volatility that the market beta premium should be expected to be negative about 9% of the time over 10-year periods, it seems likely that the odds have risen.According to data from Ken French\\\\u2019s website, from 1927 through 2022 the market beta premium was 8.6%. However, most financial economists expect it to be much smaller going forward, perhaps by half. The reason is that valuations are now much higher\\\\u2014in 1927 the CAPE 10 (cyclically adjusted P\\\\/E ratio) was about 13, whereas today it is more than double that, at about 30. Higher valuations forecast lower future returns. A smaller premium with the same volatility means greater odds of negative returns for U.S. stocks.The second path\\\\u2014diversification\\\\u2014is more likely to lead to successfully achieving goals. However, it does mean having to live with the fact that the portfolio will perform very differently than traditional portfolios, creating the risk of tracking variance regret. In that sense, diversification is not a free lunch. It means living through uncomfortable periods, even long ones. And during periods of failure, it means failing unconventionally, which is much harder to deal with.Given that investors must accept that they will have to live through uncomfortable times on whichever path they choose, it seems logical to pick the one with the highest odds of achieving their goals. And that is choosing the more efficient portfolio\\\\u2014the one that is more diversified across factors that provide exposure to unique sources of risk such as size and value\\\\u2014and saying to oneself, \\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t care about tracking variance regret because relativism [how you performed relative to some popular index] has no place in investing.\\\\u201dThe opinions expressed are the author\\\\u2019s.

So far, a recession hasn\\\\u2019t materialized. Economic growth has remained strong, with generally positive corporate earnings reports and unemployment still close to historic lows.But even if an economic slowdown isn\\\\u2019t imminent, there will be one eventually. The economy moves in cycles, with periods of economic strength followed by contractions and vice versa. Historically, recessions (generally defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining growth in gross domestic product) have occurred about once every five to 10 years, although the length of time between recessionary periods varies.It\\\\u2019s impossible to predict the timing or severity of a potential recession. And in many cases, it\\\\u2019s often only clear that a recession has happened after the fact, or after the market has already started reacting to slower economic growth. That said, looking at which types of investments have historically fared best during economic downturns can help you limit some of the damage. In this article, I\\\\u2019ll look at investing during a recession from multiple angles, including asset classes, factors, and sectors. (Note: For most of this analysis, I\\\\u2019ll focus on the past four or five most recent recessions because performance data is harder to come by for earlier periods.)Asset ClassesFrom an asset-class perspective, stocks are usually one of the worst places to be during a recession. The reason is simple: Recessions happen when there\\\\u2019s a decline in economic activity, which is usually accompanied by weaker trends in revenue and earnings growth. As companies produce less favorable results, their stock prices usually suffer.As a result, stocks had negative returns in most (but not all) previous recessions dating back to the Great Depression. Some of the worst recent results were during the global financial crisis, when stocks lost an annualized 24% between late 2007 and mid-2009.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTotal Returns (%) by Asset Class\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      On the flip side, bonds have been the best place to be in most previous recessions. Investors often seek shelter in lower-risk assets during periods of economic distress, which helps support bond prices. In addition, the Federal Reserve often cuts interest rates in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, also resulting in higher bond prices. Because of their higher level of sensitivity to interest rates, long-term bonds have historically fared best during recessions, although intermediate-term bonds and cash have also been pretty resilient. Gold has also been a winning asset class during recessionary periods, with positive returns during the eight most recent recessions since 1993. But the yellow metal had a relatively anemic showing during recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s; returns were negative after inflation.Investment StyleI used Morningstar\\\\u2019s U.S. equity fund categories as a proxy for measuring investment style. As shown in the table below, growth stocks have typically held up better during recessionary periods. Companies that have growth-oriented stocks typically have higher earnings growth, cleaner balance sheets, and better profitability\\\\u2014all traits that often help them hold up better than companies with cheaper stock prices during recessionary periods. But growth stocks haven\\\\u2019t fared well during every recessionary period. Growth stocks were hit hard in the tech-stock correction in the early 2000s, which coincided with a brief recessionary period in 2001.From a style perspective, large has generally been better than small during periods of economic weakness. Larger companies tend to have more stable earnings, diversified business operations, and the financial wherewithal to sustain their operations even during recessions. Smaller companies, on the other hand, may depend heavily on a single line of business and often have fewer financial reserves to sustain them during recessions.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTotal Returns (%) by Investment Style\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Equity FactorsEquity factors are another way of examining the drivers of equity market returns. Factors describe additional characteristics (beyond traditional metrics such as sector, market cap, and value\\\\/growth) that help to explain investment management styles and resulting performance differences. Because equity market returns are generally negative during a recessionary period, no investment factor consistently generated positive returns. In relative terms, the quality factor has historically fared best during periods of economic weakness. Definitions for quality vary, but the MSCI index that I used for this study focuses on stocks that score well on three main metrics: high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTotal Returns (%) by Investment Factor\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      The minimum volatility factor, which is designed to capture stocks with lower betas, volatility, and idiosyncratic risk, has fared second-best, and dividend stocks have also held up relatively well.On the negative side, the value factor has performed the worst during most recessionary periods by a fairly wide margin. (Note: This benchmark for this factor is similar to the value fund categories I discussed above, but it has more extreme performance traits because it has a more pronounced value bent than the typical value fund.) The value factor tends to be overweighted in economically sensitive sectors, such as basic materials, consumer cyclicals, and financials. This is usually a negative, but the early 1980s\\\\u2019 recession\\\\u2014a \\\\u201cstagflation\\\\u201d period that featured sluggish growth, high inflation, and high unemployment rates\\\\u2014was an exception. The value factor posted the best returns during that period.Equity SectorsFrom a sector perspective, healthcare and consumer staples stocks have been the most resilient performers during periods of economic weakness. Consumers can\\\\u2019t easily cut back on prescription drugs, medical devices, or household basics like canned goods and paper towels even if they\\\\u2019re feeling the effects of a weaker economy.On the negative side, energy and infrastructure stocks have been the hardest-hit in recent recessions. Companies in these sectors are acutely sensitive to swings in demand. Financials stocks also can suffer during recessions because of a rising default rate and shrinking net interest margins.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTotal Returns (%) by Sector\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Technology and communications stocks have a mixed record. During the 1990-91 recession amid the Gulf War and oil supply issues, the communications and technology sectors held up relatively well, and tech leaders such as Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and International Business Machines IBM continued to generate double-digit returns. After surging during most of the 1990s, the tech bubble finally popped in 2000, followed by a brief recession in 2001. Because valuations were still inflated leading up to the recession, the communications and technology sectors suffered the deepest losses.Does the prospect of a looming recession mean you should overhaul your portfolio? No. In fact, making wholesale shifts in portfolio holdings is usually a bad idea. But just like being mentally prepared for winter in Chicago can help longtime residents like me survive the tough season ahead, studying how the market has historically performed can help you set expectations for how your holdings might react if and when the economy weakens.

Instead, it\\\\u2019s their home. Research done by the Survey of Consumer Finances identified primary residences as the largest asset on household balance sheets.The United States is not the only property-crazed nation out there. Back in June, my colleague Mark LaMonica wrote a wonderful article about the Australian housing market and why he was opting out. Reading Mark\\\\u2019s article, I was floored by how much of it resonated with me. Like him, I am fortunate enough to have the means to purchase a home. Like him, I have opted not to.How Much Money Do I Need to Buy a House?Clearly, I\\\\u2019m going against the grain, and I know it. Only 34% of Americans share my lifestyle; many of them are facing a much different financial picture than I am. And I\\\\u2019m a millennial, which means that I am part of the homeownership-killing generation. I hope that by sharing my personal experience that others may find resonance with it, but of course investing is not one-size-fits-all. Take everything I say with a pinch of salt, ideally sprinkled on top of some avocado toast.A few facts about me before I begin. I am 28 years old. I live in Chicago. I am married, but I do not have kids. I am fortunate that my personal liabilities are light. My parents paid for my college education, so I graduated debt-free. I do not own a car, but my husband does. Since I do not have children, I\\\\u2019m not anchored to a particular school district. What\\\\u2019s Your Investment Approach?In his article, Mark outlined his philosophy for financial success. He organizes his decision-making process around his own personal statement of cash flows, keeping fixed costs at a minimum in order to maximize his flexibility.Others put housing in an entirely separate bucket from their human capital and treat it as a luxury good to consume. To these homeowners, a house is worth the money they put into it simply because they like the stability a home provides.Personally, I can\\\\u2019t stop thinking like an investor, even when I probably should. To make matters worse, I tend to think like a value investor, and value investments can fall out of favor for long periods of time.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tValue Investing Can Fall Out of Favor for Long Stretches\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Still, I prefer to buy things when they\\\\u2019re cheap. I probably read too much Benjamin Graham at an impressionable age, so now that\\\\u2019s just how I\\\\u2019m wired. You may have a different style, and that\\\\u2019s great. The important thing is to know what it is. Step 1: Define Your Time HorizonThe stalwart Mark has opted to rent for life. I\\\\u2019m not so resolute\\\\u2014I do happen to be in the position of wanting to own a home some day, if only to taste the freedom of getting to choose a paint color other than \\\\u201cFrench Gray.\\\\u201d But when is some day? For any investment decision I make, the time horizon is the starting point of my personal flow chart.Practically, my entry point would be the same as most other urbanites\\\\u2014a starter condo. Let\\\\u2019s say I want to buy a condo at a $500,000 price point, which is slightly below the median price of my area, but I like round numbers. I\\\\u2019ve squirreled enough away for a 20% down payment on that amount, which means I\\\\u2019d borrow $400,000.Based on a casual survey of my older peers, a starter condo would probably last my husband and me about five years. After that, life starts to get in the way\\\\u2014more dogs, more books, more camping gear, all clamoring for a fixed amount of square footage. Eventually, it becomes time to move on. As far as time horizons go, five years is pretty short. The average American spends 13.2 years in their home. Let\\\\u2019s assume I take out a mortgage at an interest rate of 7.6%. Holding home prices constant, by September 2028, I will have notched away an extra 5.3% of equity in my home. (Fear not, we\\\\u2019ll get to return potential in a minute.)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tHome Equity Accrues Slowly in Early Stages of Homeownership\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Step 2: Identify the Opportunity SetThis is a highly variable analysis based on a lot of factors that are unique to me. With so many levers to pull, people (read: pushy relatives) tend to probe at the boundaries of your investment universe: What if you put more money down, what if you bought somewhere other than Chicago, what if you bought fewer lattes, what if you stayed in the condo for a few more years\\\\u2014if, if, if.The choices are overwhelming. Know that I\\\\u2019ve run through other scenarios, too. To escape the decision paralysis, today we\\\\u2019re going to just focus on this one investment opportunity. A $500,000 condo within city limits, with 80% leverage and an exit after five years. That\\\\u2019s my opportunity set. It\\\\u2019s probably not yours! Being in the position of even considering a starter condo already makes me wildly fortunate relative to my peers with higher debt burdens. I hope you find this exercise useful anyway.Step 3: Establish Your Risk ToleranceThe third step on my personal flow chart is to establish my risk tolerance, given my time horizon and opportunity set. I am comfortable taking informed risks over long time horizons, like investing heavily in stocks for retirement while I\\\\u2019m still early in my career. But when it comes to shorter-term investing decisions, I am a nervous Nellie. Tail risks aren\\\\u2019t just theory for me: As a middle schooler during the 2008 financial crisis, I watched as my college savings went up in smoke. I need to have a very high degree of confidence because I know firsthand the pain of starting from scratch.My threshold becomes even higher when I consider the mechanics of a home purchase from a lending perspective. In investing, leverage is a powerful tool best used sparingly. The statutory limits for a \\\\u201840 Act mutual fund are 33.3% of overall fund assets. That means that for every $1 million in assets under management, a fund can borrow $333,333 to increase its buying capacity.Meanwhile, everyone considers it normal that homes are purchased with 80% leverage\\\\u2014if not more. For a $1 million home, an investor can borrow $800,000. Yes, the mechanics are very different. But I still think this is kind of wild! For me, it means I need to be extra sure that I\\\\u2019m making the right choice.Step 4: Conduct a Valuation AssessmentNext, I\\\\u2019m going to tally the expenses, which for homes tend to multiply like rabbits. I\\\\u2019ve tried to highlight the most salient ones, but I don\\\\u2019t think this is an exhaustive list by any means.I am probably going to spend at least 1%, or $5,000, a year on maintenance costs. (That expense merely staves off decline; it doesn\\\\u2019t include improvements to increase property value.)I\\\\u2019ll fork over another $2,900 in insurance costs.I live in a major metro, which means HOA fees will run me somewhere around $4,200 annually.I live in Chicago, long an outlier in terms of property taxes. They\\\\u2019re going to set me back $11,000 per year.When I sell my property, I\\\\u2019ll probably pay a \\\\u201cback-end load\\\\u201d in the form of closing fees, which are around 8% of the sale price in my area. For the sake of this analysis, I\\\\u2019ll spread that out over five years so that it is $8,000 per year.Holy smokes. $31,100 is already far more than what I pay in rent each year.Then there\\\\u2019s the interest expenses. Early on in a mortgage, they\\\\u2019re high. If I sell my condo in five years, I will have made a total of $169,547 in mortgage payments. The portion of those payments that go to interest is $148,300, which leaves a paltry $21,582 for principal payments. First-time buyers in this market\\\\u2014I feel your pain.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tIn Early Years, Vast Majority of Monthly Payments Go Toward Interest\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Interest expenses aren\\\\u2019t all bad, though, because they generate income tax deductions that can be significant. Everybody\\\\u2019s tax situation is unique, but in the 22% tax bracket (2 times the average household income of Chicago), I could deduct $30,300 in interest payments and $10,000 in property taxes from my income. That\\\\u2019s around $40,300 in tax deductions. Adjusting for the standard deduction that\\\\u2019s available to all taxpayers ($27,700), I could save an extra $2,800 a year. That brings my expenses down to $28,300.If $28,300 was an expense ratio on a mutual fund, it\\\\u2019d be around 5.7% of total net assets. That\\\\u2019s a pretty lousy value proposition when I could just keep my overall costs lower and buy an index fund for free.However, there\\\\u2019s one final sweetener. Unlike an index fund, residential real estate almost always appreciates in value above and beyond home equity, which is why leverage is so normalized.Ilyce Glink: The State of the U.S. Residential Real Estate MarketEven though Chicago has been in population decline since the 1950s, it has still seen the value of its properties go up by about 3.8% since the year 2000. (That return goes up to 5.8% if you venture out into greener pastures like San Francisco and Seattle.) If my home appreciates by the usual amount, it would be worth $601,400 by the time I go to sell it. That means that I would earn $222,982 on my total contributions of $121,582 for a 9.9% internal rate of return. Leverage is neat!\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tReturn on Investment Heavily Dependent on Sale Price\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      That illustration rests on a key assumption, though, one that I don\\\\u2019t hold. I do not assume that the returns that prevailed over the past 23 years are going to hold true over the next five. That\\\\u2019s the real sticking point. If I was going to stay in my home for 10 years, or 13.2, or 30, my calculus would be different. But it\\\\u2019s not.This is the chart that I can\\\\u2019t get out of my head. This is where my internal Benjamin Graham starts whispering in my ear.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t2020s Do Not Obey Linear Relationship Between Mortgage Rates and Home Prices\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      On the y-axis is the Case-Shiller Index for the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is an aggregation of home price values indexed to the year 2000. On the x-axis, we have the prevailing interest rate, courtesy of the Saint Louis FRED.When interest rates are low, prices are high. When interest rates rise, prices fall. Either way, the monthly payment that Chicagoans make when they enter into a new mortgage obeys the laws of gravity. Those two big dots, way up high in the chart, taunting Newton? Those are the years 2022 and 2023.There\\\\u2019s a simple explanation. Home prices are not responding to interest rates as they normally would because buyers are flush with cash and sellers are scarce. That throws the relationship between interest rates and the prices of Chicago home values out of whack. It does not, however, make them any cheaper.So What?How the housing affordability question gets resolved remains an open question. Interest rates could come down, making a monthly payment more affordable. Even better for first-time buyers, home prices could go down, making for a cheaper entry point. It need not take a global financial crisis to unwind. New construction could ramp up to meet existing demand, altering the mix of Chicago\\\\u2019s housing stock and increasing affordability overall.Could it be the case that it doesn\\\\u2019t get resolved at all, and Americans continue to pay ever-higher prices for a place to live? Aussies like Mark would say they sure can. These events are out of my control. What I can control is my peace of mind.Simply put, for me today, the math ain\\\\u2019t mathing. I have a low degree of confidence that the current return environment for residential real estate in my area will continue to prevail over the next five years, and that makes me unwilling to take a highly leveraged bet on a single asset. I have no qualms about sitting tight and aging out of the starter condo market, at which point the personal economics (not to mention the emotions!) of a home purchase change. I\\\\u2019m a long-term investor, and for the largest asset I will ever own, I don\\\\u2019t mind the idea of being in it for the long haul.Your math may be entirely different from mine. In fact, I hope it is. Everybody\\\\u2019s investment philosophy is as unique as their fingerprint and formed by their lived experience. I sleep better at night knowing that I have listened to the Benjamin Graham inside my head. You probably don\\\\u2019t have a Benjamin Graham inside your head\\\\u2014lucky you. For something as personal as a home, there\\\\u2019s no right or wrong approach. But there is great power in self-awareness.Correction (Sept. 20, 2023): In the calculation of income tax deductions, a previous version of this article didn\\\\u2019t account for the tax benefits of the standard deduction.\",\"Article Author\":\"Madeline Hume\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Sep 18, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"A Crucial Tipping Point for Bond Investors to Keep in Mind\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/portfolios\\\\/crucial-tipping-point-bond-investors-keep-mind\",\"Article Content\":\"After years of sleepwalking along at modest levels, bond yields and the markets that trade them have jolted awake. Dogged inflation and a surprisingly durable economic recovery have pushed the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by more than 5 percentage points since the current hiking cycle began 18 months ago, plunging bond markets into uncharted waters.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tRate Hike Cycles, 1983-2023\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Investors have been caught in the whipsaw. The 10-Year U.S. Treasury Bond, one of the most closely watched bond benchmarks, has seen its yield spike from 1.7% as of February 2022 to 4.1% as of August 2023\\\\u2014the first time it crossed 4% since the global financial crisis. (Yields rise when prices fall, so the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF IEF lost 14.6% over that stretch.)There are a few rules of thumb that are helpful for bond investors to take note of when navigating choppy markets like this one. One has laid dormant in the fixed-income markets for nearly 15 years: a concept known as escape velocity. This concept is a useful one but requires dusting off.What is Escape Velocity?Higher bond yields realign the risks that investors should emphasize when choosing what bonds to invest in. When yields are low, that means bond prices are not discounted very much relative to the face value of the bond (effectively the amount of the loan). With a lower price cushion, the risk of capital losses\\\\u2014that is, bond prices falling owing to a subsequent rise in market rates\\\\u2014is high. That makes a bond more attuned to shifts in the prevailing interest rate, all else equal. Duration is a way of expressing this relationship mathematically. It has a few ingredients: the face value of the bond, the coupon rate, the prevailing market interest rate, and years to maturity. By discounting the cash flows back to today, duration gives you an approximate measure of a bond\\\\u2019s sensitivity to interest-rate movements, given its starting yield. A good rule is that you can expect a bond to rise or fall by its modified duration, which is denominated in years, for every 1 percentage point move up or down in interest rates. We can illustrate this concept with a hypothetical $1,000 plain-vanilla bond that matures in 10 years and pays out an annual coupon of 4%.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tRising Yields Mean Lower Durations\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      For most of the past 15 years, Treasury bond investors operated in an environment where yield was extremely hard to find\\\\u2014not too dissimilar from the first two rows in this table. As evidenced by the table, lower yields modestly extend a bond\\\\u2019s duration, creating a slightly bumpier ride for bond investors.In those types of situations, it\\\\u2019s almost always true that a high-quality government bond\\\\u2019s duration is greater than yield to maturity, which means that bond investors can expect a negative nominal return as rates rise. Take the example of a bond priced at par, found in Row 2 in the table above. If rates rise after the bond is bought, the fall in price offsets the coupon and the investor loses money.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPerformance of a Hypothetical Bond at 4% Yield to Maturity\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Bummer, right? But as interest rates start to creep up, that no longer has to be the case. The north and south poles of bond investing invert: Yields rise, and bond prices fall. If the conditions are just right, yields can actually overtake duration. That\\\\u2019s where escape velocity comes in, and stuff starts to get really weird.How Does It Work?Let\\\\u2019s take the example of the bond in the bottom row of the table above. If rates start at 10% instead of 4%, an investor would pay $631 upfront instead of $1,000. If rates rise by 1 percentage point, the bond\\\\u2019s duration of 7.2 means it will lose roughly 7.2% of its value\\\\u2014not fun. However, an investor still has a margin of safety: $632 is a lot cheaper than $1,000, and they still have the same amount of coupons coming in the door, and time has passed, which brings the investor a year closer to their bond maturing.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tPerformance of an Identical Bond at 10% Yield to Maturity\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Inclusive of all of those levers, one can expect that over a calendar year the gears of bond math will overturn the initial price decline and an investor will end up with a positive nominal return of 3.3%. This math holds over the entire life of the bond, which means rates can rise to almost 19% and the investor will still end up with a positive return.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTime value of Money Outweighs Rising Yields as a Bond Approaches Maturity\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Which Bonds Have Reached Escape Velocity?It varies from bond to bond, but generally speaking short-term bonds with a duration of less than three years are the only bonds that are currently at escape velocity in aggregate.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tOnly Short-Term Bonds Have Reached Escape Velocity\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      That means that for investors who own bonds in this bucket, the direction of rates generally doesn\\\\u2019t affect the price of their investments enough to outweigh the margin of safety gifted by the time value of money. Investors can make enough for the next several years from the coupons they receive, boosted by the passage of time, that it doesn\\\\u2019t matter quite so much whether the bond market itself is in the red or in the black. However, it also means that most bond investors are still toeing the line between current bond yields and future interest-rate changes. What can they take away from this tipping point?ConclusionsIn the current interest-rate environment, escape velocity indicates that short-term bonds are on sale. Investors have fled the asset class in droves, hollowing out that bond market segment in favor of a barbell of shorter-term securities like money market funds, which have even higher yields, and bonds with a longer time horizon, which offer more certainty.It\\\\u2019s not hard to figure out why. Don\\\\u2019t fight the Fed, as the saying goes. John Rekenthaler discussed in his column just yesterday that long-term bonds have merit for investors who are confident that the Fed is close to finished with its current hiking cycle, as it has suggested. Meanwhile, cash-like instruments are going for an even deeper discount than short-term bonds are, providing all the income that some investors need to satisfy near-term goals. All along the yield curve, investors are bracing for the impact of impending rate cuts. But they are flocking to extremes in the process, and yield curve timing is a complicated art.

It depends. Many investors don\\\\u2019t need to load up on cash if they\\\\u2019re saving for long-term goals, but cash plays a critical role for retirees and other investors with shorter-term spending needs.In this series on portfolio basics, I\\\\u2019ll explain some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\\\\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Is Cash?Cash doesn\\\\u2019t only refer to the bills in your wallet. The term is broadly used to describe not just hard currency but other safe, liquid holdings such as Treasury bills, money market funds, and bank accounts.There are a lot of these assets out there. Based on the most recent quarterly report from the Federal Reserve, U.S. households own about $4.2 trillion in checking accounts and U.S. currency, $9.5 trillion in savings accounts and short-term instruments, and $3.2 trillion in money market funds. If you added in assets held by corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations, those totals would be even higher.What Role Should Cash Play in Your Portfolio?What Are the Advantages and Risks of Holding Cash?Cash has two main advantages: safety and liquidity. The U.S. dollar is perceived as a safe asset because while it\\\\u2019s not backed by any physical assets, it\\\\u2019s supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Outside of the United States, the U.S. dollar is a major reserve currency, meaning large amounts of dollars are held by central banks and major financial institutions to use for international transactions. Because the U.S. dollar plays such a key role in the global economy, it\\\\u2019s generally considered to be a reliable store of value globally. Cash is also safe because it essentially never loses value, at least in nominal terms. Moreover, cash is the most liquid asset. You can easily spend U.S. dollars. You can also easily access cashlike assets, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market funds, to make purchases, asset transfers, and debt payments.This safety comes at a price: lower returns. As shown in the chart below, cash has both the lowest risk and the lowest returns of any major asset class over time.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: Cash and Other Assets\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Because cash has no potential for capital appreciation, returns on cash are driven by yield. Over the past 40 years or so, yields on the three-month Treasury bill have ranged from a high of 16.3% in May 1981 to a low of 0.5% in October 2021.After the Federal Reserve made a series of aggressive interest-rate hikes starting in early 2022, the target federal-funds rate has increased by more than 500 basis points. (More on how this works in the next section.) As a result, the three-month Treasury bill yield had reached 5.31% as of Aug. 24, 2023, which was actually higher than the most recent inflation number over the past 12 months.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t3-Month Treasury Bill Yield Since 1954\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: https:\\\\/\\\\/fredhelp.stlouisfed.org. Data as of June 30, 2023. But holding cash isn\\\\u2019t usually a good way to stay ahead of inflation, as shown in the table below. Because yields on short-term securities have been so low (until recently), annualized returns for cash have fallen behind inflation over most of these trailing periods. That said, returns on cash have edged slightly ahead of inflation if you look at the entire 96\\\\u00bd-year period between January 1926 and now.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAnnualized Returns for Cash vs. Inflation (%)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. When Does Cash Perform Best?As mentioned above, yield is the main driver of cash returns. The yield on cash is partly driven by Federal Reserve policy since the target federal-funds range sets the rate for overnight bank lending, which in turn has a major impact on borrowing costs and overall financial conditions. As a result, the federal-funds rate indirectly affects short-term interest rates for cash and other securities. However, current yields on short-term Treasuries and other cashlike assets also reflect the market\\\\u2019s expectations for future inflation and interest rates. Some of the most generous periods for cash returns were in the 1970s and 1980s, but those periods were also marked by above-average inflation.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAnnualized Returns for Cash and Inflation by Decade (%)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How Long Should I Plan to Hold On to My Cash Assets?Morningstar\\\\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework considers cash to be the only suitable asset for holding periods of 12 months or less. If you have a spending need coming up a bit further out, such as within one to two years, cash might also be the best parking spot.And it\\\\u2019s always important to keep some cash on hand to cover unexpected emergencies, such as job loss, car repair, appliance replacement, and so on. Most financial advisors recommend keeping at least six to 12 months\\\\u2019 worth of living expenses in cash as an emergency fund\\\\u2014even if you don\\\\u2019t end up spending it right away.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Cash?The answer to this question largely depends on your life stage. If you\\\\u2019re many years away from retirement, you don\\\\u2019t need to allocate much to cash, assuming you already have an emergency fund set aside, as well as enough liquid assets to cover any short-term spending needs. Setting aside cash gets more important as you get closer to retirement age. Financial advisors typically recommend that retirees keep at least one to two years\\\\u2019 worth of expenses in cash or other low-risk assets. The reason? Holding cash gives you a ready source of liquidity for short-term spending and means you don\\\\u2019t have to sell stocks or bonds when the market is down.Where\\\\u2019s the Best Place to Stash My Cash?The table below shows some of the pros and cons of various ways to hold cash.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tWhere To Keep Your Cash\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar. What Funds Pair Well With Cash?If you\\\\u2019ve already set up sufficient cash reserves, a U.S. large-cap stock fund, international-stock fund, or a bond fund could be a logical addition.U.S. large-cap stock funds: These funds are a key foundation for nearly every investor\\\\u2019s portfolio. They\\\\u2019ve produced outstanding total returns over time and are one of the best ways to generate wealth for long-term financial goals. As mentioned above, U.S. stocks currently make up about 60% of global market capitalization, so we consider them core holdings that could make up the majority of a portfolio\\\\u2019s equity exposure.International-stock funds: Stocks located in markets outside the U.S. currently make up about 40% of the global market based on the value of shares outstanding. That makes them worth owning for the sake of getting more complete exposure to equity markets around the world. International stocks can also provide diversification benefits (especially as a hedge against weakness in the U.S. dollar) and exposure to leading companies outside the U.S.Bond funds: These funds typically help buffer against losses in years when the stock market is down (although rising interest rates and unexpectedly high inflation led to sharp losses for both stocks and bonds in 2022). Bond funds have also often had negative correlations with the equity market, which can help improve risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds.Should I Hold Cash in My Portfolio?You should hold some cash, but it\\\\u2019s not really an investment asset because of its lack of growth potential. That means that you can think of your cash holdings separately\\\\u2014not as a core component of your investment portfolio. While the generous yields currently available on cash may be tempting, keep in mind that it doesn\\\\u2019t generate enough growth to help fuel long-term capital appreciation.Correction (Aug. 29, 2023): A previous version of this article stated that the 40-year high yield on the three-month Treasury bill was 15.1% in September 2021.

I\\\\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are International Stocks?For investors who live in the United States, stocks of companies based in other countries are considered international stocks. International-stock funds can focus on developed markets (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan), emerging markets (such as China, India, or Brazil), or a combination of both.As of July 2023, non-U.S. stocks made up about 40% of global market capitalization. Because international stocks make up a significant portion of the available equity market, it makes sense for most investors to have some exposure to international stocks. Most international stocks are denominated in non-U.S. currencies and trade on exchanges in their local markets. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor\\\\u2019s stock is denominated in the new Taiwan dollar and trades on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, and Finland-based Nordea bank trades in the Danish krone on Nasdaq Copenhagen.The exception: American depositary receipts, or ADRs, which are certificates issued by a U.S. bank that represent ownership in foreign companies. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars and trade on U.S. stock exchanges.What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in International Stocks?International stocks have two main advantages: diversification and the potential to perform better than U.S. stocks over certain periods. In the past, non-U.S. stocks have had relatively low correlations with their U.S. stock counterparts, leading to better risk-adjusted returns for a globally diversified portfolio. As the economy has become increasingly global, though, U.S. and non-U.S. stocks have started moving more in tandem over the past couple of decades.There have also been certain periods, such as the early 1970s, late 1980s, and 2002 through mid-2008, when international stocks have fared better than their U.S. counterparts. These periods often correspond to periods when the U.S. dollar was weak: Stronger non-U.S. currencies mean that investors in international stocks come out ahead when their returns are translated back to U.S. dollars. More recently, however, international stocks have fallen behind, partly because of how the U.S. dollar has strengthened over the past 10 years or so.Along with their return potential, international stocks come with certain risks, including the impact of currency movements, political conflicts, and weaker accounting standards. This means that international stocks come with relatively high risks and returns. The table below shows annualized returns and standard deviations for international stocks in developed and emerging markets compared with other major asset classes over the past 20 years.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: Cash and Other Assets\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Historically, international stocks have lost as much as 50% or more during market drawdowns, such as the global financial crisis that started in late 2007 and the coronavirus-driven bear market in early 2020. On a quarterly basis, they\\\\u2019ve been subject to losses as large as 20% or more. Like other stocks, however, international stocks go up more often than they go down\\\\u2014helping them generate rewarding returns over time.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tOther Risk and Drawdown Stats (Since 1990)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How to Invest in International StocksThere are two main ways to invest in international stocks: by purchasing individual stocks or by purchasing a fund. Buying international stocks on local exchanges would probably be impractical for most individual investors. As mentioned above, ADRs are another more accessible option for purchasing individual foreign stocks. There are about 430 ADRs currently traded on major exchanges in the U.S., plus about 2,000 more that trade over the counter.But buying individual stocks also comes with additional risks. If you own one stock (or even as many as 20 different stocks), you\\\\u2019ll be subject to stock-specific risk\\\\u2014meaning that the odds of things going poorly are much higher than they would be with a diversified portfolio. In 2021, for example, nearly one out of every three ADRs lost 10% or more, even though non-U.S. stocks as a whole gained about 8% for the year.For most investors, broadly diversified index funds are the best way to invest in international stocks. Few active managers have been able to consistently outperform the overall market over time. Index funds, on the other hand, harness the market\\\\u2019s collective wisdom about the relative value of each stock included in a given benchmark. They\\\\u2019re also cheaper: Investors in actively managed international-stock funds pony up annual expenses of about 1%, on average, but the typical index fund costs less than half of that.If you only own one international-stock fund, I\\\\u2019d focus on the foreign large-blend Morningstar Category rather than more specialized areas. The foreign large-blend category typically provides the broadest exposure to the overall market, and it isn\\\\u2019t as subject to market swings that can cause growth, value, or region-specific funds to go in and out of favor over multiyear periods. Global large-blend funds can also be a good option if you want to get exposure to U.S. and non-U.S. stocks in a single package.When Do International Stocks Perform Best?Like all stocks, international stocks typically perform best during periods of strong economic growth, rising corporate profits, declining interest rates, and low inflation.As mentioned above, international stocks also usually fare best during periods of U.S. dollar weakness. The table below shows annualized returns for international stocks during some of their strongest periods.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAnnualized Returns During the Best Times for International Stocks\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How Long Should I Hold My Investments in Large-Cap Stocks?Morningstar\\\\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework recommends holding international-stock funds for at least 10 years. We came up with this guideline partly by looking at the historical frequency of losses over various rolling time periods ranging from one year to 10 years. We also considered the maximum time to recovery, or how long it usually takes to recover after a drawdown.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in International Stocks?There\\\\u2019s no easy answer to this question.Some people argue that you don\\\\u2019t need separate exposure to international stocks at all, given that many leading companies in the U.S. earn a significant portion of their revenue from overseas. Vanguard founder Jack Bogle was famously skeptical about the value of international investing, arguing that non-U.S. companies can\\\\u2019t keep pace with those in the U.S. based on innovation, productivity, technological advancement, and shareholder protection.On the other hand, skipping out on international stocks would mean missing out on some of the world\\\\u2019s leading companies, such as Nestle SA, Samsung Electronics, and Novo Nordisk. Plus, international stocks can generate better returns at times when the U.S. might be struggling. And as mentioned above, international stocks currently make up about 40% of the market\\\\u2019s overall capitalization globally.So, we maintain that most investors should probably have some type of exposure to non-U.S. stocks.We consider foreign large-blend funds to be core holdings that could make up as much as 40% to 80% of a portfolio\\\\u2019s assets, although most investors will probably want to keep their exposure on the lower end of that range.Foreign large-growth and foreign large-value funds fill more specialized roles; we consider them \\\\u201cbuilding blocks\\\\u201d that could make up as much as 15% to 40% of a portfolio\\\\u2019s assets. Because of the higher risk inherent in emerging markets or region-specific funds, we recommend limiting them to 15% of assets or less.What Are the Best International-Stock Funds?The table below shows a subset of highly rated index funds dedicated to international stocks. I\\\\u2019ve focused on international-stock funds that are broadly available through major brokerage platforms, with low investment minimums and ultralow expense ratios.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tHighly Rated International-Stock Funds (Index Funds)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct.

The CMBI Bitcoin Index posted a 76.4% return through July 2023 in defiance of the gloomy narratives that haunt the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.The trusty balanced portfolio has also beaten expectations as of late. Vanguard Balanced Index VBAIX has turned in a respectable 12.8% for the year to date after a lousy 2022 that augured the age-old question of whether the 60\\\\/40 fund (referring to its split between stocks and bonds) might be dead. Balanced funds\\\\u2019 performance owes a great deal to the excellent performance of U.S. stocks, which have returned a hearty 20.6%, as measured by the Morningstar US Market Index.So far in 2023, risk has paid handsomely. That fact may leave many investors wondering whether to add some extra firepower to their portfolio in the form of an allocation to bitcoin. Compared with other assets, though, bitcoin\\\\u2019s volatility is more kerosene than kindling. Over the 10-year period ended July 2023, bitcoin was 16.8 times as volatile as Vanguard Balanced Index. (The only asset that comes anywhere close is oil, although the price history of the Dow Jones Crude Oil Index only goes back to 2015.)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tRolling One-Year Volatility of Bitcoin Exceeds Other Assets\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Even though bitcoin has performed favorably since the last time we examined bitcoin\\\\u2019s impact on the 60\\\\/40 in 2021, its returns are still nearly 4 times as volatile as those of a balanced fund. That means that even a smidge of bitcoin changes the behavior of an investor\\\\u2019s portfolio a whole lot.How Much Is a Lot?Let\\\\u2019s say that in August 2013 a hypothetical investor added a 2% allocation to bitcoin to a costless 60\\\\/40 portfolio\\\\u2014that\\\\u2019s $20 in bitcoin for every $1,000 invested. (For the purposes of this example, let\\\\u2019s also assume the investor furnished that $20 investment from their bond portfolio, although it doesn\\\\u2019t change the results much whether that money comes from stocks or bonds. We also rebalanced this portfolio on a monthly basis\\\\u2014that will become important in a second.)Our study found that a 2% sliver of bitcoin reshaped the return profile of their portfolio nearly as much as adding a 10% stake in stocks would have: A 60%\\\\/38%\\\\/2% split between stocks\\\\/bonds\\\\/bitcoin yielded a standard deviation of 10.7 over the past 10 years, in line with how a 70%\\\\/30% S&P 500\\\\/Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond portfolio would have behaved.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tBitcoin Alters Standard Deviations Far More Than Additional Stock Exposure\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Further up the risk spectrum, a portfolio with a 5% stake in bitcoin had a risk profile closer to a 90\\\\/10 portfolio than a 60\\\\/40. In fact, if that hypothetical portfolio was a fund, adding bitcoin would have easily pushed it out of the moderate allocation Morningstar Category to which most balanced funds belong. The closest match among allocation categories is the aggressive allocation category, meaning that the portfolio leapfrogged the moderately aggressive allocation category altogether. (Meanwhile, any portfolio with a 10% allocation or more to bitcoin courted more risk than the S&P 500 on its own!) Decomposing that risk reveals even more. Effectively, a 1% allocation to bitcoin has a negligible effect on risk, either in terms of absolute volatility or relative contribution. But a 2% allocation to bitcoin explains close to 15% of a portfolio\\\\u2019s overall volatility, a much heftier contribution. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation accounts for nearly 45% of the return volatility the portfolio experienced, and overall volatility was meaningfully higher.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tBitcoin\\'s Relative Contribution to Risk Increases With Additional Exposure\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Although adding bitcoin does open up the risk throttle on these hypothetical portfolios, it\\\\u2019s worth pointing out that investors would have been fairly compensated for doing so. A costless 60\\\\/40 portfolio would have turned in a Sharpe ratio (a return metric that accounts for risk) of roughly 0.77 over the past decade. Each portfolio that contains bitcoin improves upon that result, although incremental improvements peak at a 5% slice.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tBitcoin Has Compensated Investors for Additional Risk\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. With that being said, our portfolios were crafted using a fairly narrow set of assumptions that aren\\\\u2019t likely to hold in practice. That\\\\u2019s because regulators in the United States have barred most brokerages from offering bitcoin alongside traditional stock and bond investments. Most digital assets are quarantined in a separate wallet or exchange account, which makes it tedious for investors to rebalance on a monthly cadence like we did in our study. Whether because of inertia or mental accounting or both, many investors opt not to rebalance at all.When it comes to security selection\\\\u2014picking individual stocks, for example\\\\u2014the \\\\u201cDo Nothing\\\\u201d approach may have some merit. But when it comes to asset allocation, there are consequences to portfolio neglect. For example, a 1% allocation to bitcoin (funded proportionally from stocks and bonds this time, to replicate the experience of segregating assets) can quickly spiral into a 60% allocation if investors fail to reap what they\\\\u2019ve sown.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFailing to Rebalance Has Significant Consequences for an Investor\\'s Asset Allocation\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Even one annual rebalance makes a world of difference. There are some edge cases, like 2013 and 2017, where the allocation to bitcoin would have climbed above 5%. But mostly it plods along somewhere between 1% and 2%. For only 15 months out of the entire 10-year holding period does the portfolio overtake that 2% threshold where the portfolio experiences volatility that\\\\u2019s out of spec with the risk profile of a 60\\\\/40 portfolio.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAnnual Rebalances Partially Succeed in Keeping Allocation to Bitcoin in Check\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. While the SEC weighs proposals that might broaden investor access to bitcoin by way of an exchange-traded fund, we see a marginal benefit to existing owners of digital assets who would have an easier time trying to rebalance this high-octane holding if it\\\\u2019s permitted to live alongside their traditional investments. But without the investor protections that other asset classes provide, we continue to advise that investors treat purchases of digital assets (including bitcoin) as a sunk cost rather than an investable asset.Even so, there are investors who fall somewhere in between these two extremes and treat bitcoin as something more than a sunk cost but less than a full-blown portfolio holding. I would advise those investors to tread cautiously. Like caviar or dynamite, a little bit of bitcoin goes a long way.

I\\\\u2019ll examine the most widely used types of investments and what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are Large-Cap Stocks?Large-cap stocks are defined based on their market capitalization (also known as market cap), which measures the total value of a stock\\\\u2019s shares outstanding, or the number of shares that are publicly traded multiplied by the current stock price.Morningstar defines a stock as large-cap if it lands within the top 70% of aggregate market capitalization for a given market, such as the United States, Europe, or Canada. (Currently, stocks with market caps of about $12.8 billion or more qualify as large-cap.) Stocks with larger market caps tend to be widely recognizable names, such as Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon.com AMZN. By definition, large-cap stocks make up the majority of the available market, so it makes sense that they should make up a significant portion of most investors\\\\u2019 total equity exposure.What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in Large-Cap Stocks?Large-cap stocks have several advantages. Because they\\\\u2019re widely held by so many investors, they\\\\u2019re extensively researched and liquid. Their sheer size means their performance is generally a pretty good gauge of the equity market overall.As shown in the chart below, large-cap stocks have generated strong returns over time. Over the 97 years since 1926, small-cap stocks have fared even better, with an annualized performance edge of about 1.5 percentage points per year. However, large-cap stocks have outperformed in more recent periods, such as the 14-year timespan following the global financial crisis.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tGrowth of $1 Over Time\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Along with their return potential, stocks come with certain risks. In contrast to bonds, which offer more certainty about their value at maturity, stocks are inherently riskier. And while bondholders receive periodic interest payments (typically at a set rate) in exchange for lending money to the bond issuer, the value of a stock is both difficult to model and constantly changing. This means that large-cap stocks come with relatively high risks and returns.

If you own one stock (or even as many as 20 different stocks), you\\\\u2019ll be subject to stock-specific risk\\\\u2014meaning that the odds of things going poorly are much higher than they would be with a diversified portfolio. In 2021, for example, about 1 out of every 6 large-cap stocks lost 10% or more, even though the overall market generated positive total returns of about 26% for the year. For most investors, broadly diversified index funds are the best way to invest in large-cap stocks. Few active managers have been able to consistently outperform the overall market over time. Index funds, on the other hand, harness the market\\\\u2019s collective wisdom about the relative value of each stock included in a given benchmark. They\\\\u2019re also cheaper: Investors in actively managed large-cap stock funds pony up annual expenses of about 88 basis points, on average, but the typical passively managed large-cap stock fund charges less than half of that.If you only own one large-cap stock fund, I\\\\u2019d focus on large-cap blend rather than large value or large growth. Large-cap blend typically provides the broadest exposure to the overall market, and isn\\\\u2019t as subject to market vicissitudes that can cause growth and value stocks to swing in and out of favor over multiyear periods.When Do Large-Cap Stocks Perform Best?Large-cap stocks typically perform best during periods of strong economic growth, rising corporate profits, declining interest rates, and low inflation. The table below shows annualized returns for large-cap stocks during several recent bull markets.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tReturns for Large-Cap Stocks in Recent Bull Markets\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Total returns are annualized. How Long Should I Hold My Investments in Large-Cap Stocks?Morningstar\\\\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework recommends holding stock funds for at least 10 years. We came up with this guideline partly by looking at the historical frequency of losses over various rolling time periods ranging from one year to 10 years.The idea is to minimize the odds that an investment is in the red at the same time that you need to access the money to fund a goal.Over a five-year period, for example, returns for large-blend and large-growth funds have been negative about 18% of the time. Over a 10-year period, the odds of incurring a loss are significantly lower.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tFrequency of Losses Over Rolling Periods Since 1990\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of Dec. 31, 2022. Numbers in the headings indicate the length of the rolling period in years. Another way to think about this issue is by looking at the maximum time to recovery, or how long it typically takes for a given fund category to recover after suffering a drawdown. As shown in the table below, large-blend and large-value funds have historically recovered within about six years. Large-growth funds have taken as long as 13 years to win back their losses after a market downturn.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMaximum Time to Recovery for Large-Cap Stock Categories Since 1990\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Large-Cap Stocks?The answer to this question largely depends on your portfolio\\\\u2019s overall asset mix.If you\\\\u2019re investing for a short-term (less than two years) or intermediate-term goal (two to six years), you\\\\u2019ll probably want to tilt your portfolio more toward cash and bonds. If your time horizon is long enough, however, a larger stock allocation may make more sense.Within the equity portion of a portfolio, it makes sense to use the overall composition of the market as a starting point. Large-cap stocks account for more than 70% of the market\\\\u2019s overall market capitalization; as a result, they\\\\u2019re generally a good proxy for the performance of stocks in general.That\\\\u2019s particularly true for large-blend funds, which we recommend as core holdings that could make up as much as 40% to 80% of a portfolio\\\\u2019s assets. Large-value and large-growth funds fill more specialized roles; we consider them \\\\u201cbuilding blocks\\\\u201d that could make up as much as 15% to 40% of a portfolio\\\\u2019s assets.What Are the Best Large-Cap Stock Funds?The table below shows a subset of highly rated index funds focusing on large-cap stocks. I\\\\u2019ve focused on large-cap blend funds that are broadly available through major brokerage platforms, with low investment minimums and ultralow expense ratios.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA Few Highly Rated Large-Cap Stock Funds (Index Funds)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. The list below includes a few actively managed funds from Russ Kinnel\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cThrilling 31\\\\u2033 list, which features funds with relatively low expense ratios, high Morningstar Medalist ratings, portfolio managers who have invested at least $1 million in their own fund, and above-average returns during the manager\\\\u2019s tenure for at least five years.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tA Few Highly Rated Large-Cap Stock Funds (Actively Managed Funds)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      What Funds Pair Well with Large-Cap Stock Funds?If you\\\\u2019ve already added a large-cap stock fund to your portfolio, a bond fund or international-stock fund could be a logical addition.Bond funds typically help buffer against losses in years when the stock market is down (although rising interest rates and unexpectedly high inflation led to sharp losses for both stocks and bonds in 2022). Bond funds have also often had negative correlations with the equity market, which can help improve risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds.International-stock funds can provide more complete exposure to the global market. U.S. stocks currently make up about 60% of global market capitalization, but non-U.S. stocks account for the remaining 40%. And while correlations between U.S. and non-U.S. stocks have trended up over the past couple of decades, international stocks can offer diversification benefits. There are also certain periods in which international stocks have had a performance edge.Small-cap stock funds can also make a good complement to large-cap stock funds. They offer some diversification benefits and might enhance returns over longer periods. If you select a \\\\u201ctotal market\\\\u201d index fund, though, you probably don\\\\u2019t need to add a separate small-cap stock fund. Most \\\\u201ctotal market\\\\u201d indexes provide broad exposure across the entire market-cap spectrum.Should I Invest in Large-Cap Stocks?As long as you have a long enough time horizon, large-cap stocks are a key foundation for nearly every investor\\\\u2019s portfolio. They\\\\u2019ve produced outstanding total returns over time, and are one of the best ways to generate wealth for long-term financial goals.\",\"Article Author\":\"Amy Arnott\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Aug 7, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Are Younger Investors Too Conservative?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/portfolios\\\\/are-younger-investors-too-conservative\",\"Article Content\":\"Last month, my esteemed colleague John Rekenthaler weighed in on the question of whether older investors have become too aggressive, based on research Vanguard conducted on retirement savers in the defined-contribution plans it record-keeps for.To summarize, John took the view that, yes, some older investors are too aggressive. To be sure, the near-retirees that invest in their plan\\\\u2019s default option typically do just fine. But, as John points out in his piece, roughly half of older investors can\\\\u2019t resist the urge to tinker when left to their own devices.On the flip side, Vanguard also found that younger investors largely don\\\\u2019t fall prey to the same temptation. More than 75% of investors under the age of 35 invest in a single target-date fund, which is generally considered the gold standard for retirement saving. What Is a Target-Date Fund, and Why Do Young Investors Love Them?A target-date fund is a multi-asset strategy that gradually shifts from stocks to bonds over the course of the investor\\\\u2019s life. Typically, people buy or are defaulted into one through their 401(k), IRA, or health saving account and select the strategy that has a year that lines up with the year they expect to retire. Target-date funds\\\\u2019 key feature is a \\\\u201cglide path,\\\\u201d which describes how the investment adjusts the proportion of retirement savings that are allocated to different asset classes over time. As the riskier asset, stocks are the primary engine of an investor\\\\u2019s returns over the long run, so most target-date funds start with a generous helping of them before gliding to a much lower allocation later on.Target-date funds have soared in popularity as the default option for automatic enrollment in defined-contribution plans, and to some extent the uptick in adoption reflects plan sponsors steering younger investors into the vehicle. But a good chunk of them are opting into these strategies, too, which is a welcome development: Our research has found that target-date fund investors have tended to fare better than average, capturing more of the funds\\\\u2019 total returns when compared with other types of funds.That said, Vanguard also found that the younger participants in its record-keeping plans were still investing only around 89% of their assets in stocks. That is pretty low, as the average longer-date target-date fund we track stakes around 93% in stocks, as shown in the chart below.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tVanguard\\'s Average Investor Allocates Less to Stocks Than the Typical Target-Date Fund\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      It appears that the average young investor in a Vanguard record-keeping plan is underweight stocks relative to the typical target-date fund. It\\\\u2019s a puzzling finding at first, but there are a few simple reasons why this could be. The first is that the \\\\u201cHow America Saves\\\\u201d methodology accounts for the dominance of the biggest target-date strategies, which are more conservative than the norm. (Morningstar does not take assets under management into account when defining the average target-date fund.) The two biggest target-date series\\\\u2014Vanguard itself and Fidelity\\\\u2014collectively command almost 50% of all target-date assets under management. Their glide paths start with 90% in stocks, a notch more cautious than the average target-date series.The other issue could be friction. Target-date managers can\\\\u2019t always invest all the way up to their desired strategic glide path\\\\u2014they need to keep some cash on hand to meet redemptions. Investors, too, may not be fully invested all the time. This is more of a problem for younger investors, whose contributions each month make up a significant portion of their overall balance.Whatever the reason, it appears that younger investors are slightly more conservative in their retirement plans than they ought to be. The question is whether that\\\\u2019s a problem. Could It Have an Effect on Younger Investors\\\\u2019 Retirement Savings?The short answer appears to be no.Target dates glide the way they do because they strike a balance between two sources of wealth: human capital and financial capital. Early on in their careers, young people may lack savings (that is, financial capital), but they boast future earnings potential (human capital).The best way for someone early on in their career to improve their retirement outlook is by, in effect, converting their human capital into financial capital. They do so by socking away a portion of each paycheck. As time wears on and those savings compound, the picture changes, with financial capital approaching and eventually exceeding human capital.What does that have to do with one\\\\u2019s stock allocation? It\\\\u2019s important to keep in mind that, until around age 35, contributions make up more than half of an investor\\\\u2019s overall balance, with investment returns making up the rest. Given that, modest changes in an investor\\\\u2019s asset allocation don\\\\u2019t make a very big difference.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tUntil Age 35, Contributions Make Up More Than 50% of an Investor\\'s Total Portfolio\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      An example might help to illustrate why this is so. Assume that stocks earn about 10% a year, while bonds print about 6%. If a young plan participant invested 5% more in stocks than they do in the average Vanguard target-date fund, they\\\\u2019d theoretically take home an extra 0.2% each year. So, let\\\\u2019s imagine it\\\\u2019s a 22-year-old investor who earns an average salary today and experiences the normal level of salary growth (broken out by gender, given the differences in growth and trajectory) over the course of their career. How would that participant\\\\u2019s ending balance vary if they began by allocating 89% to stocks versus 93%, contributed 10% of their take-home pay, and received a standard employer match?When we run the numbers, we find that upping the stock allocation would add about $50,000 to that 22-year-old\\\\u2019s account balance by the time they retire. (All figures are nominal and assume a 4% inflation rate.)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tInvestors Could Earn Roughly $50,000 From 10 Years of Extra Stock Exposure\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      But that pales when compared with the benefits the 22-year-old participant would reap by nudging her contribution rate a bit higher. For instance, if that investor chipped in 11% of their salary instead of 10% for the first 10 years of their career, it could add more than $300,000 to their ultimate balance.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tBut for Younger Investors, Contributions Make a Much Greater Impact\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      In that sense, quibbling over the asset allocation kind of misses the point. For young investors, it\\\\u2019s contribution rate, and not the stock\\\\/bond mix, that really moves the needle when it comes to the size of one\\\\u2019s retirement nest egg.On the Other Hand \\\\u2026With a 40-year time horizon to play with, the consequences of a young investor sprinkling on some added risk are minimal. Investors are not as likely to make trades when they\\\\u2019re invested in a target-date fund and are less likely to yank money out when their investments start to slump.Vanguard, of course, is aware of this. With respect to its target-date series, the firm argues that any risk above what\\\\u2019s absolutely necessary to deliver on investors\\\\u2019 retirement savings goals is unwise. Vanguard maintains a 10% exposure in bonds in order to temper volatility during downturns and favors higher contribution rates of 12%-15% to give investors the best chance of success. With contributions packing such a big punch, why court any more risk when stocks slide?Still, it\\\\u2019s hard to argue against an extra dash of equity if you can stomach it. Like young investors, stocks have a great deal of potential: In the long run, they do deliver excess returns over bonds, all else equal. The road to get there might be bumpy, but every little bit counts. It may take lower fees, higher equity, or extra contributions for young investors to meet their ultimate retirement goal. Then again, it more than likely will take some combination of all three.\",\"Article Author\":\"Madeline Hume\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Aug 1, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"7 Things I Don\\\\u2019t Own in My Portfolio\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/portfolios\\\\/7-things-i-dont-own-my-portfolio\",\"Article Content\":\"As someone who writes about building portfolios for a living, I do research on many types of investments, ranging from tried-and-true core holdings to more-esoteric corners of the investment world. A key part of my job is to comb through the available evidence and help readers understand the pros and cons of various investment types for their own portfolios.But what do I actually do with my own money? Here, I\\\\u2019ll discuss seven popular investment types on which I\\\\u2019ve decided to take a pass. I\\\\u2019ll also discuss the rationale behind why I\\\\u2019ve decided not to incorporate each one.Actively Managed FundsI still own shares in a couple of actively managed funds. But they\\\\u2019re mostly holdovers from a few rollover IRAs and make up a smallish slice of my overall assets. The majority of my fund holdings are passively managed index funds. This wasn\\\\u2019t always the case. I spent the first part of my career analyzing mutual funds, and it\\\\u2019s always fascinating to hear active managers explain the rationale behind their investment decisions. And there are a few active managers who have consistently added value for fund shareholders over time.But with more experience in both life and investing, I\\\\u2019ve become more skeptical about the value of active management in general. Keeping the bulk of my assets passively managed also simplifies portfolio management. I can focus the majority of my time on making sure my overall asset mix is appropriate for my financial situation and goals instead of keeping track of whether an active manager is still adding value.At the risk of splitting hairs, I do own shares in Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B and VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF MOAT, which could both be considered quasi-actively managed portfolios. In addition to its business operations in insurance, energy generation and distribution, and rail transport, Berkshire maintains a large investment portfolio. The VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF tracks an index, but the index itself relies on human judgment. The Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index features companies that Morningstar\\\\u2019s equity analysts believe have two key attributes: a sustainable competitive advantage and a low price compared with their estimated fair value. Real Estate Investment TrustsI have small stakes in real estate as part of my holdings in a diversified equity index fund and a target-date fund, but I don\\\\u2019t have any dedicated exposure to REITs or other real estate stocks. I often see articles hyping up the importance of real estate in a diversified portfolio. Real estate is often touted for its generally low correlation with other equity assets, as well as its ability to generate above-average returns over time.I\\\\u2019ve written about why I\\\\u2019m skeptical about real estate in a previous article. There are two key reasons behind my jaundiced view: diversification and idiosyncratic risk. On the diversification side, I think the value of real estate as a portfolio diversifier has often been overstated. Over the past three years, for example, the real estate sector has had a correlation coefficient of about 0.86 when measured against the broader U.S. equity market. In addition, real estate has been subject to periodic downdrafts that are difficult to predict: Witness the 21% cumulative loss in the FTSE Nareit All Equity REIT Index from 1998 through 1999, or the 47% cumulative loss in the same index from 2007 through 2008.As these drawdowns suggest, there are a lot of idiosyncratic risks specific to real estate investing. I don\\\\u2019t have any specialized industry knowledge that would give me a unique capability to mitigate these risks. Since I\\\\u2019m not fully convinced about the merits of real estate in the first place, I\\\\u2019ve put it in the \\\\u201ctoo hard\\\\u201d pile. Sector FundsThere\\\\u2019s no question that innovations in healthcare, technology, and communications have the potential to enhance human progress for years to come. But there\\\\u2019s often a disconnect between the growth potential of a given sector and its investment merit. By the time people start getting intrigued by the growth prospects for a given sector or industry, much of the potential is already priced into valuations. The technology sector, for example, which ranks as the most popular area for sector funds, is currently trading at 8% premium to estimated fair value.Over the trailing 10-year period through June 30, 2023, the average sector fund (including funds that have been merged or liquidated out of existence) has gained just 7%, compared with about 12.4% for diversified market benchmarks such as the Morningstar US Market Index. What\\\\u2019s more, sector funds have been incredibly difficult for investors to effectively use in a portfolio. In the most recent edition of Morningstar\\\\u2019s annual Mind the Gap study, we found that dollar-weighted returns for sector funds over the 10-year period through 2021 trailed time-weighted returns by more than 4 percentage points per year. With a track record like that, I\\\\u2019m staying far, far away.Alternative InvestmentsAlternative investments are designed to offer something fundamentally different from mainstream asset classes. Morningstar defines these strategies based on their ability to modify, diversify, or eliminate traditional market risks. The universe of alternative funds ranges from strategies that attempt to limit or offset their equity exposure to those that focus on absolute returns, meaning they focus on capital preservation and aim to generate positive returns no matter what the market environment.As John Rekenthaler has pointed out, though, alts\\\\u2019 track record is mixed at best. Some alternative-fund categories\\\\u2014particularly systematic trend and equity market-neutral\\\\u2014were successful during 2022\\\\u2032s bear market. But over longer periods, they\\\\u2019ve generally been disappointing. Over the past 15 years, the typical alternatives fund has gained less than 2% in annualized returns.Nontraditional equity funds, which employ strategies such as derivatives, shorting, and options overlays while maintaining exposure to traditional market risks, have fared a bit better, with annualized returns of 4.4% over the same period. But that\\\\u2019s well behind the 8% return of a traditional 60\\\\/40 mix of large-cap stocks and investment-grade bonds over the trailing 15-year period.Could alternative investments fare better going forward? It\\\\u2019s possible. But I\\\\u2019m not convinced.I BondsIn contrast to the areas discussed above, I don\\\\u2019t have a philosophical objection to I Bonds, which are Treasury bonds that pay a fixed rate of interest plus another layer of interest that adjusts to keep up with the current inflation rate, with the inflation adjustment made every six months. I Bonds are one of the best ways to hedge against inflation, especially if you can purchase them at a time when they\\\\u2019re offering an attractive real yield.They also boast tax benefits. I Bonds\\\\u2019 accrued interest is exempt from federal taxes until they mature or are sold off, and all interest is free from state and local taxes.Why haven\\\\u2019t I bought them? The reasons are pretty mundane: purchase limits and other practical drawbacks. For the most part, individual investors can only purchase $10,000 worth of I Bonds per year, making it tough to amass a big enough position to make a significant difference in an already-established portfolio. And I Bonds can only be bought and sold through the Treasury Direct website, which is reportedly somewhat clunky and out of date. At this point in my life, I\\\\u2019m reluctant to add yet another login and password to my list, which will add complexity both during my lifetime and for surviving family members after my death.High-Yield BondsHigh-yield bonds offer a yield premium in exchange for their additional credit risk, with the yield premium over Treasuries historically averaging more than 500 basis points.They\\\\u2019ve also generated above-average returns over time. Over the past 30 years, for example, the average high-yield bond fund has produced annualized returns of about 5.4% per year, on average, compared with 3.9% for the average intermediate-term core bond fund.But high-yield bonds also have some drawbacks. Because of their added levels of credit risk, they tend to be more equitylike than bondlike. Over the past three years, for example, the Morningstar US High-Yield Bond Index has had a correlation coefficient of about 0.85 versus a broad stock market benchmark. That makes high-yield bonds less useful as portfolio diversifiers than other fixed-income securities, such as investment-grade corporates, government bonds, and cash.High-yield bonds have also been subject to sharp drawdowns at times. During the global financial crisis, for example, high-yield bonds lost about a third of their value from June 2007 through August 2009.Overall, high-yield bonds don\\\\u2019t look that compelling to me on a risk-adjusted basis. My main goal for fixed-income holdings is to offset the risk of my equity assets, so I\\\\u2019ve given junk bonds a pass.GoldI\\\\u2019ve written about some of the virtues of gold in a previous article. It has a relatively solid record as a safe haven during periods of market crisis and also sports a low correlation with most major asset classes. Over the past three years, gold had a correlation of just 0.12 when measured against stocks and just 0.43 when measured against investment-grade bonds.But I haven\\\\u2019t been impressed enough to add it to my portfolio. Fundamentally, gold isn\\\\u2019t a growth asset: Its value typically remains stable in inflation-adjusted terms over long-term market cycles. My primary investment goal is long-term growth, and I have enough cash and shorter-term bond holdings to add ballast during market drawdowns. If I were truly worried about some type of financial Armageddon, I\\\\u2019d probably consider adding gold as an insurance policy, but I\\\\u2019m still pretty sanguine about the prospects for investing in mainstream asset classes.ConclusionWould I ever consider adding a position in one of the areas discussed above? Maybe. If new evidence emerged about their merit or if I looked at the pros and cons again and came to a different conclusion, I wouldn\\\\u2019t necessarily rule them out. At this stage, though, I\\\\u2019m comfortable keeping them off-limits for my portfolio.Disclosure: Morningstar, Inc. licenses indexes to financial institutions as the tracking indexes for investable products, such as exchange-traded funds, sponsored by the financial institution.

How can bond managers compete with 5% yields on cash? What should\\\\u2014and should not\\\\u2014be in your core portfolio? This is Investing Insights.Welcome to Investing Insights. I\\\\u2019m your host, Ruth Saldanha. Let\\\\u2019s get started with a look at your Morningstar headlines.Netflix Surpassed ExpectationsNetflix released a solid earnings report for the second quarter, topping Morningstar estimates. The streamer\\\\u2019s crackdown to turn password sharing into paid sharing led to the addition of almost 6 million subscribers. Netflix now boasts that it has more than 238 million global paid subscribers. Management says it expects growth to continue as the paid sharing plan is rolled out in all its markets. Despite the additional subscribers and fees, revenue lined up with estimates, partly due to stagnant average revenue per user in North America and Europe, Netflix\\\\u2019s two largest regions. Revenue rose 3% to $8.2 billion. However, growth hasn\\\\u2019t hit double digits since the fourth quarter of 2021, despite price hikes and the crackdown on password sharing. And once the benefits of paid sharing level off, attracting new subscribers will likely be challenging, even as competition in streaming is intensifying. Morningstar is upping its estimate for what Netflix shares are worth to $330 from $315. But still, the stock appears overvalued. United Airlines Q2 Results SoaredUnited Airlines reported robust second-quarter results, but higher costs loom on the horizon. The airline\\\\u2019s passenger revenue surpassed Morningstar\\\\u2019s expectations, and it almost sold out capacity, or available seats. Pilot hiring and delayed delivery of Boeing planes have constrained the U.S. airline industry. A shortage of air traffic controllers has led to capacity cutbacks. The playing field should remain level in the competitive industry as long as this continues. Morningstar expects higher revenue and booking rates across the board. Costs are starting to go up, however, as airlines try to push capacity beyond 2019 levels. Low fuel prices and unusually full planes should pay for these increases. Once either of these wavers, though, Morningstar expects lower profitability and the return of risky price competition. Morningstar is lowering its estimate for what United\\\\u2019s shares are worth by $1, to $35 per share.PNC Projected Slower GrowthPNC Financial Services reported slightly weaker results than the biggest banks. The regional bank also projected slower growth in net interest income, or the money that banks make on loans for the full year, while larger lenders actually raised their outlooks. Rising funding costs like higher payouts to savers on their deposits and slower loan growth are driving the decline. Despite the down numbers, results came in close to Morningstar\\\\u2019s expectations. Morningstar says regional banks will face more pressure on net interest income than the largest banks. That\\\\u2019s in line with updated expectations, and it isn\\\\u2019t leading to dramatic negative revisions like in the last quarter. PNC\\\\u2019s revenue and net interest income are still set to grow this year, despite this year\\\\u2019s banking crisis. Morningstar plans to update its forecast and may lower its $175 estimate for PNC shares. Currently, the stock looks undervalued.Inflation, Cash, and BondsNo one has escaped the effects of higher inflation\\\\u2014whether it\\\\u2019s when we are paying more for gas or groceries or utilities. To tame these prices, the Fed has been raising rates, and as a result, cash rates have skyrocketed\\\\u2014in some cases to as high as 5%. How can bond managers compete? Madeline Hume is a NEXT senior research analyst for Morningstar Research Services, and she has been tracking this space and is here to talk about it. Madeline, thank you so much for being here today. Madeline Hume: Thank you for having me, Ruth.Bond Outlook 2023Saldanha: What do flows look like for bonds, especially short- and medium-term bonds?Hume: Overall, flows are pretty steady when you look at bond funds in general, but that belies a lot of volatility underneath. You\\\\u2019ve got a large reallocation happening away from short-term bonds into bond funds that invest in longer-term bonds and also into cash. The category has lost a staggering $19 billion year to date, ranking among the highest in bond categories for outflows. Why Should Investors Consider Bonds?Saldanha: Is fleeing for bonds in favor of cash a good strategy right now? With yields being so high, why should investors consider bonds at all?Hume: Yeah, it\\\\u2019s not a good idea now, and it\\\\u2019s not a good idea ever. Cash and bonds both have yields, but ultimately, they serve different purposes in an investor\\\\u2019s portfolio. Bonds have something that\\\\u2019s known as duration, which basically means rate sensitivity. Cash doesn\\\\u2019t have that. So effectively, you\\\\u2019re comparing apples to oranges.Opportunity Costs of Holding Money in Bond FundsSaldanha: What about the opportunity cost of holding money in tied-up bond funds?Hume: The flip side of cash rates right now is, with cash, what you\\\\u2019ve got is a yield that looks really promising and is quoted on an annual rate, but that rate can change at any time if interest rates are adjusting. When you think about asset allocation and diversification, it\\\\u2019s a bit like a Ferris wheel. If something is up, that means that one asset class is performing well and another asset class is down, but that can change very quickly. So as I mentioned, with cash rates in particular, that can change nearly instantly.Bond funds, meanwhile, have money that\\\\u2019s locked up for a little bit longer, and so you have a guaranteed rate that holds for a little bit longer period of time. There are benefits and there are drawbacks to that. The drawback is that your money is locked up, and so there may be a more promising rate elsewhere, but you have to remember that, with investing, the grass is always a little bit greener somewhere else.The reason that bond funds are not earning as much as cash right now is because yield curves are inverted, and that means that investors don\\\\u2019t know as much about the short term as they do about the long term, so they command a little bit higher premium in order to keep their money in shorter-term investments because they\\\\u2019re not sure if in six months or in 12 months the Fed is going to be lowering those interest rates.That\\\\u2019s not the normal state of affairs. For investors, while they may be buying bonds now and those rates may be lower than what cash is, eventually rates will normalize and longer-term rates will come back up, and so there is this mean-reversion effect that you\\\\u2019ve got going on. So for people who choose to put their money in cash, if rates fall, their yields immediately adjust, but bonds allow investors to reduce their reinvestment risk, and they don\\\\u2019t have to necessarily worry about that scenario.Income in Investor\\\\u2019s PortfolioSaldanha: What should investors do for the income portion of their portfolios right now?Hume: Cash yields are so tempting right now that it\\\\u2019s easy to forget that we\\\\u2019ve entered in an entirely new paradigm as far as interest rates go. Two years ago, a bond yielded about 0.21%, and today a two-year bond is yielding about 4.9%. So while you might be able to make marginally more money in cash, ultimately 4.9% is still nothing to sniff at. It\\\\u2019s certainly much better than the scraps bond investors have been feeding on for the past 10 years. If you\\\\u2019ve got the right asset allocation, ultimately the best advice that I have is to do nothing and let the markets do their thing.Saldanha: Great. Thank you for joining us with your perspectives, Madeline.Hume: Thank you so much, Ruth.5 Surprising Investments That Shouldn\\\\u2019t Be Long-Term Core HoldingsSaldanha: Most of us construct our portfolios around some core holdings, and then there may be some fun or play holdings. New Morningstar research shed some light on the types of funds that should be in the core holdings for most investors\\\\u2019 long-term portfolios\\\\u2014and some that absolutely don\\\\u2019t belong in that coveted core holding spot. Amy Arnott is a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, and she sat down with Morningstar Inc.\\\\u2019s investment strategist Susan Dziubinski to discuss this. Let\\\\u2019s listen to what they had to say.Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I\\\\u2019m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. New Morningstar research shed some light on the types of funds that should be the core holdings for most investors\\\\u2019 long-term portfolios. But what types of funds don\\\\u2019t belong among an investor\\\\u2019s core holdings? Let\\\\u2019s find out. I\\\\u2019m joined today by Amy Arnott, who is a portfolio strategist with Morningstar Research Services.Hi, Amy. Nice to see you today.Amy Arnott: Thanks, Susan. Nice to be here again.Dziubinski: Now, we\\\\u2019ve talked before about your role in portfolio research, and viewers who are interested in learning more about that can watch the video through a link that will be included in the transcript. But give us a quick rundown of what the research is about and how investors can use it.Arnott: Sure. This role in portfolio framework is really designed to give investors practical guidance when they\\\\u2019re trying to put funds together in a portfolio. It\\\\u2019s not just about finding good funds with low expense ratios, but then taking the next step of how do you put them together in a portfolio in a way that makes sense for your specific financial goals. When we came up with this, there are two key dimensions: One is the time horizon, and the second one, as you mentioned, is the role in portfolio\\\\u2014or what size should a position play within the portfolio.Dziubinski: Amy, in your research, you define four roles in portfolio that an investment can offer based on the diversification that it provides. And those four roles are stand-alone, core, building block, and limited. Now stand-alone funds are those one-and-done investments that are going to provide you diversification in one place, maybe a target-date fund or asset-allocation funds. Core funds are the funds that should take up the bulk of a portfolio for an investor who doesn\\\\u2019t want to necessarily pursue that stand-alone approach to their portfolio, that one-and-done approach. The Morningstar Categories that qualified in your research as core holdings would be from the U.S. large-blend, the foreign large-blend, and the global large-blend categories. Why these three categories?Arnott: As you mentioned, we look at core holdings as something that would be appropriate for a large percentage of your assets, which we define as somewhere as much as 40% to 80% of your assets. And we look at core holdings as something that\\\\u2019s going to give you broad representation for a major asset class. In the case of the three categories that you mentioned, we\\\\u2019re looking for broad exposure to stocks in general. And the three categories that you mentioned we think are appropriate as core holdings on the stock side because they are really giving you a broad representation of the overall stock market. If you look at something like Vanguard Total Stock Market, VTI, for example, you\\\\u2019re getting exposure not just to that middle section of actual large-blend stocks but also some exposure to large-growth and large-value. So, if you\\\\u2019re looking for something that\\\\u2019s going to represent the equity market in general, a fund like that or a similar fund from the foreign large-blend or global large-blend category is a good place to start.Dziubinski: Got it. So, you mentioned U.S. large value and U.S. large growth, and it may surprise some readers\\\\u2014it surprised me a little bit\\\\u2014that these types of funds, these fund categories don\\\\u2019t actually fall under the definition of how you\\\\u2019re defining the core fund camp. Instead, they\\\\u2019re sort of the next tier down. They\\\\u2019re part of that building-block type of holding in a portfolio. Walk us through why they aren\\\\u2019t core.Arnott: If you look at large value or large growth, these are smaller slices of the equity market, so it\\\\u2019s not giving you quite the same level of broad market exposure. Another issue is that just as we found that it\\\\u2019s very difficult for active managers to outperform by deviating from a market index, it\\\\u2019s also very difficult to outperform by overweighting a specific investment style. If you do that, there might be periods when you have good returns. For example, on the large-growth side, that style outperformed by a pretty wide margin over most of the period from 2009 through 2021. But there have been other times when that would have really hurt your results. For example, during the technology correction that started in the year 2000, large-growth stocks fell behind by a pretty wide margin. And it would have taken you a long time, actually more than 13 years, to make up that loss. So, there\\\\u2019s definitely more risk associated with overweighting either value or growth.Dziubinski: Got it. So, now, another surprise for some investors might be that U.S. small-cap blend, small-cap value, and small-cap growth, those categories aren\\\\u2019t considered core in your framework. And in fact, they\\\\u2019re not even considered building blocks. They were assigned the limited role, which is even further down the ladder. Why is that?Arnott: It all goes back to the idea of using the neutral market portfolio as a starting point for your equity investments. And typically, you want to keep your allocations in line with how the overall market is allocated. And so, if you look at the U.S. equity market, actually less than 10% of the outstanding market cap is in those small styles: small value, small blend, and small growth. So, that\\\\u2019s why we assign those limited roles.Dziubinski: Got it. From a practical perspective, Amy, if investors, say, combine a U.S. large-cap growth fund with a U.S. large-cap value fund, have they really just assembled the equivalent of a U.S. large-cap blend fund? And then, in that case, if that\\\\u2019s what an investor is doing, could that really, those two funds combined, serve as the core of a portfolio?Arnott: You certainly could do it that way. Starting out with equal weightings between large value and large growth, you would just have to make sure that you\\\\u2019re keeping an eye on those allocations over time so that they\\\\u2019re not getting out of balance. And you probably want to be rebalancing them once a year at least, or anytime the allocations get significantly out of balance.Dziubinski: Amy, thank you so much for your time today. This role in portfolio research is really wonderful, and we look forward to talking with you more about it.Arnott: Thanks. Great to be here.Dziubinski: I\\\\u2019m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

As a result, investors may wonder why they should invest in international stocks as more U.S. companies benefit from global growth. We sat down with Morningstar Indexes strategist Dan Lefkovitz for a quick rundown of his new paper, Global Equity Markets Grow Even More Global, and what the implications are for investors.Susan Dziubinski: You recently authored some new research examining the revenue streams of nearly 8,000 companies around the globe. Your goal was to find out how much revenue companies were generating outside of their home markets. Why the undertaking?Dan Lefkovitz: In equity investing, we tend to think about geographic exposure in a one-dimensional way: Where\\\\u2019s a company based? Looking at revenue sources adds a new dimension to our understanding. It can illuminate both risk and opportunity. Morningstar collects geographic segment data reported by thousands of companies across the world, and we can aggregate that data to the national equity market level using Morningstar country indexes. This helps answer questions like: How national are national markets? Where do they source their revenues? How have they changed over time? Dziubinski: You found that revenue streams of companies around the world are, in general, becoming more global. Delve into that.Lefkovitz: We started conducting this study in 2019\\\\u2014prepandemic. Over the past several years, we\\\\u2019ve seen markets become increasingly global in their revenue sources. That runs counter to the narrative that the pandemic and geopolitics are turning countries inward. For example, the Morningstar US Market Index is only 61% U.S.-based from a revenue perspective, compared with 66% in our 2019 study. Japan, most of Western Europe, Canada, and Australia all source a larger share of revenues from outside their home markets. According to our estimates, many European equity markets earn more in revenue from the U.S. than they do at home.Dziubinski: You note in your paper that the revenue globalization trend is most pronounced among developed countries and less pronounced among emerging markets. Why is that? Lefkovitz: Europe is home to many multinational companies. If you think about Nestle NSRGY of Switzerland, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy MC of France, Denmark\\\\u2019s Novo Nordisk NVO, or Shell SHEL and BP BP of the U.K., these companies do business across the globe. In the U.S., companies like Apple AAPL, Meta META, Alphabet GOOGL, and Microsoft MSFT are global players. Some of the biggest constituents of the Morningstar Japan Index are Toyota TM and Sony SONY.On the flip side, emerging markets tend to have fewer multinationals. The Chinese equity market is dominated by local players. Banks, telecoms, and utilities are common atop emerging market indexes, and they tend to be domestically focused. There are some exceptions: Tech companies in India, South Korea, and Taiwan; and Brazil\\\\u2019s natural resources exporters.Dig deeper: Global Equity Markets Grow Even More GlobalDziubinski: Other research has shown that the correlations between U.S. stocks and non-U.S. stocks have risen over the past two decades. Is the trend of globalizing revenue the reason why international stocks, as a group, have been less effective portfolio diversifiers for U.S.-based investors than they\\\\u2019d been in the past?Lefkovitz: Globalizing revenue sources have likely contributed to equity markets moving in lockstep. Developed markets, which are the most globalized, are more correlated with each other than emerging markets are with developed markets. To bring this concept to life, think about biopharma companies. Whether they\\\\u2019re based in the U.S., France, Switzerland, or Japan, they are exposed to many of the same forces. On the flip side, a bank in Indonesia and a bank in Canada don\\\\u2019t have much in common. Dziubinski: If U.S. companies are generating more and more of their revenues from outside of the U.S., should investors even bother investing in international stocks? Put another way, are investors already getting exposure to international growth by owning U.S. companies?Lefkovitz: I like to invert this logic. If I neglect international stocks, I lack exposure to some of the leading businesses in the U.S. market. I live in the U.S., but my kids play Nintendo on a Samsung TV; I fill up my Japanese car at a British gas station; I fuel myself with a Swiss coffeemaking machine, then go running in German shoes. In investing, it makes sense to broaden the opportunity set to the fullest. There are unique companies, industries, and growth drivers that you can\\\\u2019t get access to through a purely domestic portfolio.More Investment Portfolio Strategies Why Your Portfolio Needs International Stocks The long-term strategic rationale for building a global portfolio. 5 Surprising Investments That Shouldn\\'t Be Long-Term Core Holdings Many would consider these types of funds to be core holdings.

This year to date, fixed-income returns are positive, with those bonds that trade with a credit spread having performed better than U.S. Treasuries.This year to date, the Morningstar Core Bond Index, our proxy for the overall bond market, has risen 2.83%. The return has been supported by a combination of underlying yield carry, declining long-term interest rates, and tightening credit spreads, partially offset by rising short-term interest rates.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMorningstar U.S. Fixed Income Index Returns\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of July 19, 2023. The yield curve became further inverted in the first half of 2023. Short-term interest rates rose as the Federal Reserve hiked the federal-funds rate three times and another hike is expected at the July meeting. For example, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill rose 107 basis points to 5.49% and the yield on the one-year Treasury rose 59 basis points to 5.32%.However, on the longer end of the curve where the market dictates interest rates, as opposed to the Fed\\\\u2019s monetary policy, yields have declined slightly.

Bonds that trade with an additional credit spread over equivalent maturity U.S. Treasury bonds performed the best thus far this year. For example, the Morningstar Corporate Bond Index (our proxy for investment-grade corporate bonds) rose 4.30% and the Morningstar High Yield Bond Index rose 6.81%. The reason for the outperformance was twofold. First, those bonds provide a higher yield to compensate investors for the risk of credit rating downgrades or defaults. Second, credit spreads tightened over the first half of the year. In the corporate bond market, for the year to date through July 19, the average corporate credit spread of the Morningstar Corporate Bond Index has tightened 11 basis points to +119. In the high-yield market, the average corporate credit spread of the Morningstar High Yield Bond Index has tightened 90 basis points to +389.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMorningstar Corporate Bond Indexes: Average Credit Spread\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of July 19, 2023. Outlook for Investing in Bonds in Second-Half 2023Now appears to be a good time for investors to begin lengthening the duration of their fixed-income investments. According to our forecasts, we think the Federal Reserve will hike the fed-funds rate one last time at its July meeting and that will be the last hike in this monetary policy tightening cycle. Further, according to our U.S. economics team, we project that longer-term interest rates are at or near their peak and will begin to decline over the next six to 18 months.Another factor that supports extending out further on the yield curve is our expectation that the rate of economic growth will slow. While the stock market has risen from the undervalued levels we saw at the beginning of the year, stocks are now trading near our fair value. With stocks no longer undervalued and earnings under pressure from slowing economic growth, further gains in the stock market will likely be muted in the second half of this year.At this point, corporate bonds are less undervalued than we thought at the start of 2023, but based on our economic outlook (slowing growth, but no recession), we think the current credit spreads offer an adequate margin of safety to investors to offset future downgrade and default risk. Interest-Rate ProjectionsOver the second half of 2023, interest rates may vacillate as economic and inflationary metrics are released, but our forecast is that the interest rate on 10-year Treasuries will generally follow a downward trend which will continue into 2024 and 2025. Falling interest rates will push up long-term bond prices and help bolster fixed-income returns over the underlying yield carry.While short-term interest rates are currently higher than long-term interest rates due to the inverted yield curve, we think investors should begin to lengthen their duration over the next 12 months. Once the market begins to price in the Fed switching to an easing monetary policy, short-term rates will quickly begin to subside. We project the fed-funds rate will average 4.15% and 2.15% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMorningstar Interest Rate Forecasts\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of June 26, 2023 End of This Monetary Policy Tightening Cycle in SightThe Federal Reserve paused and held the fed-funds rate steady at its June meeting. However, with inflation still running hotter than the Fed prefers and the economy more resilient than expected, we expect that the Fed will likely hike the federal-funds rate another 25 basis points at its July meeting. Yet, we also expect that will be the final interest-rate hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle. We expect that inflation will continue to moderate enough over the next few months to convince the Fed that it has raised interest rates enough to be appropriately restrictive to keep inflation on a downward path.Not only do we expect this will be the last hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle, but we also forecast that a combination of declining inflation and a slowing rate of economic growth will provide the Fed with the basis to begin loosening monetary policy in early 2024, with a rate cut coming as early as next February. Corporate Bond Market OutlookCorporate bonds have performed very well over the first half of the year. Performance has been driven by a combination of tightening credit spreads and the higher yield carry offered by corporates. At this point, corporate bonds are now less attractive than we noted in our 2023 bond market outlook published last December. However, we think that current spread levels are adequate to compensate investors for potential downgrade & default risk.According to PitchBook, defaults have risen back up to historical averages. Based on our economic outlook for the rate of economic growth to slow, we suspect there will likely be an additional increase in downgrades or defaults. However, considering we do not expect the economy to slip into a recession, the amount of downgrades and defaults will likely be constrained and remain below levels experienced in prior recessions.The combination of higher underlying interest rates and closer-to-average credit spreads is providing investors with some of the higher all-in yields we have seen in corporate bonds over the past 10 years. The Morningstar Corporate Bond Index currently yields 5.29% and the High Yield Index yields 8.03%. The main risk to our view is if the economy slips into a deeper and\\\\/or more prolonged recession, in which case default rates could rise.Watch: 2023 Midyear Market Outlook\",\"Article Author\":\"David Sekera\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Jul 21, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Why Large-Blend Funds Should Outweigh Value Plus Growth Funds in a Portfolio\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/portfolios\\\\/why-large-blend-is-better-than-value-plus-growth\",\"Article Content\":\"Large-blend funds have much to recommend them. They\\\\u2019re the easiest way to get broad exposure to the U.S. equity market. The category is home to some of the industry\\\\u2019s biggest funds, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VTSMX. And Morningstar\\\\u2019s Role in Portfolio framework, which I rolled out earlier this year, considers large-blend funds suitable as core holdings, meaning that they could make up as much as 40% to 80% of an investor\\\\u2019s portfolio.But there\\\\u2019s more than one way to build a portfolio; you could obtain similar market exposure by combining a large-value fund and a large-growth fund. However, there may not be a lot to be gained by doing so.Reason #1: Better Market CoverageMorningstar defines large-blend funds as those that are fairly representative of the overall U.S. stock market in size, growth rates, and price. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large-cap. The blend style is assigned to portfolios where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate, and these portfolios usually invest in a wide range of economic sectors. The average large-blend fund offers pretty good exposure to a full spectrum of stocks, as shown below. While purists might prefer to stick with funds that only focus on truly large-cap stocks, having some exposure to small and midsize stocks isn\\\\u2019t a bad thing, either.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLarge Blend Equity-Style Exposure\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of May 31, 2023. Large-value and large-growth funds, on the other hand, are generally more concentrated toward their respective corners of the Morningstar Style Box.Reason #2: Similar Long-Term PerformanceAbout a year ago, John Rekenthaler ran some numbers to test whether buying equal stakes in Vanguard Value Index VIVAX and Vanguard Growth Index VIGRX and periodically rebalancing would yield better results than buying Vanguard 500 Index VFIAX. The two-fund portfolio had an annualized return advantage ranging from 10 basis points to 28 basis points over rebalancing frequencies ranging from monthly to five years. There was no return difference for a 10-year rebalancing schedule.One drawback of this analysis: the fund results only go back to November 1992. And the three funds aren\\\\u2019t exact analogues, since the Value and Growth funds now track segments of the CRSP Large Cap index rather than value and growth stocks carved out from the S&P 500. I decided to take a fresh look at this question using a trio of Russell 1000 indexes, which have performance histories dating back to 1979. The Russell 1000 Value Index carves out stocks with lower price\\\\/book ratios and lower projected growth rates, while the Growth Index consists of stocks with higher price\\\\/book ratios and better projected growth rates for revenue and earnings. The Russell 1000 Index combines the holdings of both indexes.The results were underwhelming, to say the least. As shown in the table below, there was virtually no difference in performance for a two-index test portfolio relative to the large-blend benchmark over most rebalancing frequencies. Of all the tempos tested, the seven-year rebalancing schedule looks most promising. While an annualized performance edge of 18 basis points might elicit a response of \\\\u201cmeh,\\\\u201d it could be worth the effort if you have a very long time horizon and are disciplined enough to stick to the schedule (and remember to rebalance). Over the past 44 1\\\\/2 years, an initial investment of $10,000 split between value and growth and consistently rebalanced every seven years would have ended up with a portfolio value of about $1.6 million, or about $110,000 greater than $10,000 invested in the Russell 1000 Index.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTesting the Value Plus Growth Portfolio\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct and author\\'s calculations. Data as of June 30, 2023. I also tested a threshold rebalancing strategy, which involved rebalancing the two-index portfolio whenever one of the components drifted more than 5 or 10 percentage points away from its initial weighting. Here too, there\\\\u2019s not much to write home about. The 5% rebalancing strategy for the two-index portfolio came out ever so slightly ahead of the blend index over the full period, but the difference in returns was small. The 10% rebalancing strategy, on the other hand, led to slightly lower returns.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tTesting the Value Plus Growth Portfolio: 5% and 10% Rebalancing Bands\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct and author\\'s calculations. Data as of June 30, 2023. And while value and growth have taken over market leadership over various periods (such as growth stocks over the period 2009-21 and value stocks in 2022), the results for the two styles weren\\\\u2019t dramatically different over the full period from 1979 through mid-2023. Despite academic research supporting a long-term performance advantage for value stocks, growth issues came out slightly ahead over the past 44-odd years in my study. But the difference was less than 30 basis points per year. While growth edged out value, both style indexes fell slightly behind the Russell 1000 over the full period.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tGrowth of $10,000\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Reason #3: Minimal Diversification BenefitsWe took a deep dive into correlation coefficients for various asset classes in our 2023 Diversification Landscape report. As shown in the table below, most investment styles have fairly high correlations with the overall market. Morningstar\\\\u2019s Large Growth and Large Value indexes had correlations of 0.92 and 0.89, respectively, with the Morningstar U.S. Market Index. There might be some risk reduction benefit from diversifying into value and growth, but it\\\\u2019s pretty small. What\\\\u2019s more, combining value and growth into one portfolio would wipe out any potential diversification benefits.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tThree-Year Correlation Matrix by Investment Style\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. When Large Value Funds and Large Growth Funds Are Worth OwningHowever, style-specific funds can still play a useful role. If you own a stock or fund that you\\\\u2019re reluctant to sell, you might end up with a portfolio tilted toward either value or growth. For example, someone owning a large stake in Apple AAPL (such as yours truly), might end up with a portfolio tilted toward the Large Growth corner of the Morningstar Style Box. Investing in a value-oriented fund could help offset the portfolio\\\\u2019s growth bias.An investor could also deploy a style-specific fund to take advantage of valuation discrepancies if growth stocks seem more attractively priced than value, or vice versa. As of May 31, large-value stocks covered by Morningstar\\\\u2019s equity analysts had an aggregate price\\\\/fair value ratio of 0.82, compared with 0.97 for large-growth issues. If our analysts\\\\u2019 fair value estimates are accurate, large-value stocks should generate higher returns as market prices converge to fair value. But as the rebalancing tests above suggest, reversion to the mean doesn\\\\u2019t always happen on a predictable schedule. ConclusionStyle-based investing has gained favor since Eugene Fama and Kenneth French\\\\u2019s landmark research in 1992. The three-factor model they came up with (and Morningstar popularized with the Morningstar Style Box) goes a long way toward explaining investment performance and risk. But while it seems plausible that combining growth and value could lead to better results over time, that does not seem to be the case.\",\"Article Author\":\"Amy Arnott\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Jul 17, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Is It Time to Break Up With the Bonds in Your Portfolio?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/portfolios\\\\/with-cash-rates-nearing-5-is-it-time-break-up-with-bonds-your-portfolio\",\"Article Content\":\"Investors concerned about inflation have many lingering effects to worry about, including higher prices at the gas pump, in the grocery store, and on utility bills.

There\\\\u2019s reason to wonder if it might not be better to seek the sure thing and move into cash; with flows that massive, there\\\\u2019s reason to believe many investors already have.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tBottom 5 Bond Categories By Flows YTD\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Why Should I Keep Bonds in My Portfolio?With cash rates this high, are short-term bond allocations redundant? The short answer is no.Cash rates are easy come, easy go. (Although investors with money parked in traditional savings accounts, which still yield less than 1% in many cases, might beg to differ.) Savings rates may be denominated in annual percentage yield terms, but they are rarely locked in for any sort of fixed term. Banks can dial the rate up or down, essentially at will. That means cash lacks duration, one of the more useful tools in an investor\\\\u2019s quiver. Duration solves a different portfolio problem than cash, which means that bonds and cash shouldn\\\\u2019t be compared like-for-like.Cash might be a handy parking spot for emergency savings, but for expenses any further than two years out, bonds are the better match. That\\\\u2019s because bonds are typically offered with a yield that\\\\u2019s fixed over the life of the bond.For example, if you buy a bond with a duration that aligns with the time your payment is due, you can lock in a yield over that time horizon that fits with your liability. In the meantime, you won\\\\u2019t have to worry about reinvesting your savings to chase a better rate if interest rates fall\\\\u2014unlike investors who are keeping their money in cash. Put another way, for investors that can hang on to their bond investment to maturity, what happens to interest rates after they buy their bond isn\\\\u2019t terribly important. If an investor holds a bond until it expires, at the end of that period, (assuming the issuer is creditworthy) they are made whole. When a bond matures, its owner gets their principal back, and they can use the proceeds to address their saving goals.Sounds Great, Except \\\\u2026In the meantime, your money is effectively tied up. It\\\\u2019s possible that bonds underperform other asset classes (like cash) while you hold on to them, and there\\\\u2019s not much you can do about it. It\\\\u2019s even possible to lose money if rates rise and you sell a bond before it matures.But, again, investors generally won\\\\u2019t experience any observable losses in bonds held to maturity. On the other hand, investors in a short-term bond fund have a very different row to hoe, with both yields and returns fluctuating on nearly a daily basis. How is it possible that bond funds lose money when an individual holding a bond can always opt to stick it out and recoup their principal? There are a few reasons for that. First, funds have to manage cash flows in a way that an individual owning a bond doesn\\\\u2019t. An investor owning a single bond only has to worry about the coupons they receive and the principal that the issuer repays at the end. But every single day people buy into and sell out of mutual funds; they\\\\u2019re a pooled investment, after all. Plus, managers can only distribute cash at certain pre-specified times, which means they must reinvest the coupons they receive in the interim. Bond managers trade bonds all the time, even if all their existing investors sit tight.Beyond the constraints of the mutual fund vehicle, bond funds behave differently from individual bonds in another key respect. An individual bond\\\\u2019s duration will decline as it approaches maturity.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tDuration of a Hypothetical 5-Year, 5% Semiannual Bond\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Bond fund managers typically maintain a constant maturity, which means that unlike an individual bond, the fund never expires. A fund that invests in short-term bonds will continuously roll forward its bonds so that its maturity will always be roughly several years out from today. As one bond nears maturity, the fund will buy another to nudge the portfolio\\\\u2019s maturity forward and keep its duration stable.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tDuration of Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF, 2019-2023\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      This mechanism causes the returns of an investment with a constant maturity, like a bond fund, to vary depending on the path that interest rates take.Then Why Do Investors Stick With Short-Term Bond Funds?Partly it\\\\u2019s a matter of convenience. Bond investing obeys the economies of scale, which makes it a good candidate for outsourcing. There\\\\u2019s an old rule of thumb in bond investing that you need at least $100,000 to adequately diversify a bond portfolio\\\\u2014hardly chump change. Plus, money managers get better rates on transactions than retail investors do.Additionally, it may be easy to guess roughly when an event that you\\\\u2019ve been saving up for is going to occur, but in many cases it\\\\u2019s much harder to pin down the precise timing of the cash outlay. In these types of situations, individual bonds may be too fine an instrument. If you have a goal that you\\\\u2019re saving for with an uncertain start and end date, a basket of bonds with constant maturity gives you critical leeway in your portfolio.Finally, even if you don\\\\u2019t have a timed goal in mind, your portfolio may still stand to benefit from carrying some duration. Very short-term instruments like cash are currently paying more than longer-term investments because yield curves are inverted.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tUS Treasury Yield Curve\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      That\\\\u2019s not the normal state of affairs. Longer-term rates are typically higher than shorter-term rates, and eventually the current pattern will reverse. That means that over longer periods a yield boost does kick in for holding bonds instead of cash.How much duration you should hold depends on a whole host of other factors, like your age and the time until the goal you\\\\u2019re saving for. No matter what your priorities are, it\\\\u2019s important to keep in mind that bonds tend to outperform stocks during bear markets. That makes them a good ballast to have on hand, no matter what else is happening in the markets.\",\"Article Author\":\"Madeline Hume\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Jul 17, 2023\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What I\\\\u2019ve Done Right With My Portfolio\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.morningstar.com\\\\/portfolios\\\\/what-i-got-right\",\"Article Content\":\"If you read my column last week, you might have concluded that my investment portfolio is a mess. By my own admission, I hold too much company stock and too much cash, and I don\\\\u2019t have anything close to the recommended allowance of bonds for a person my age. And while I often write about tax matters and understand the tax code pretty well, my record on curbing taxes hasn\\\\u2019t been perfect. I\\\\u2019ve held tax-inefficient funds in a taxable account and have been slow to move money into IRAs each year. Inertia (laziness, sloth, whatever you want to call it) has been the major factor behind almost all of these problem spots.But you know what? Despite these missteps, my husband and I have managed to do just fine from a big-picture standpoint; our financial plan is well in hand. Here\\\\u2019s what has worked for us, as well as my most unscientific assessment of whether the successes resulted more from luck or skill.We Maintained a High Savings RateJust as an all-black wardrobe can conceal unwanted holiday pounds, so can a high savings rate cover up a multitude of investment sins. So when I think about what has worked for us from an investment standpoint, over the long haul, a high savings rate has to be at the top of the pyramid. Luck played a starring role in our ability to save: My husband and I had the good fortune of emerging from college debt-free, which enabled us to buy a house and start saving for retirement early in our careers. We\\\\u2019ve also both been employed for three-plus decades, meaning that we\\\\u2019ve been able to steadily sock away a good share of our incomes and benefit from employer-matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and a long runway of investment compounding. I have previously mentioned that we don\\\\u2019t have a budget, but automating our investment contributions\\\\u2014not just into our company retirement plans but into our taxable account as well\\\\u2014has helped us be disciplined about saving in good markets and bad. That\\\\u2019s not to say we haven\\\\u2019t made sacrifices, especially earlier in our careers. We spent many a weekend working on our old house when we were just starting out, and I\\\\u2019ve always taken my husband\\\\u2019s hand-me-down cars and driven them for a long time. The home renovations were fun\\\\u2014mostly!\\\\u2014and I\\\\u2019m not into cars so it\\\\u2019s a stretch to call either of those things a big sacrifice. Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 30% luck\\\\/70% skillStocks DeliveredWe\\\\u2019ve also lucked out in terms of market performance during our years of investing. There have been some bad spots: 2000-02 and 2007-09, to name the biggies. But over our 35-year horizon thus far, stocks have returned about 11% on an annualized basis. That\\\\u2019s a fabulous rate of return by any measure and one that we fully benefited from thanks to an equity-heavy posture throughout the period. Of course, stock market returns over any specific time horizon are mainly luck of the draw, but I\\\\u2019m giving us a few skill points here, too. While I haven\\\\u2019t calculated an internal rate of return for our investments over our entire time horizon, I know that we haven\\\\u2019t pulled back from stocks during times of market duress. We\\\\u2019ve kept on investing and even added extra to them, above and beyond our automatic contributions, when we\\\\u2019ve had extra cash on hand during such periods. It has helped that we\\\\u2019re too busy to think much about our investments, and intellectually we understand that stocks invariably shake off their periodic swoons.Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 80% luck\\\\/20% skill We Curbed Investment CostsLimiting investment costs has been another important tailwind, one that enabled us to \\\\u201creceive our fair share of the market\\\\u2019s returns.\\\\u201d (I can never write those words without hearing Jack Bogle\\\\u2019s booming baritone in my ears.) I quickly got religion on the importance of limiting costs shortly after starting at Morningstar in 1993. The first investing book I read in my new job was Burton Malkiel\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street,\\\\u201d which makes a compelling case for low-cost passive investing. And as an analyst, I learned that expense ratios were much more predictive of a fund\\\\u2019s future prospects than its past returns. Morningstar\\\\u2019s 401(k) investment menu skews toward low-cost investments, too, and my husband and I gravitated to cheap funds for the rest of our portfolio. It\\\\u2019s hard to know where luck ends and skill begins with this one, so I\\\\u2019m calling it a draw.Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 50% luck\\\\/50% skillWe Kept It \\\\u201cBasic\\\\u201dJust last week I learned that my taste in all sorts of things (Lululemon, avocado toast) is what the kids might call \\\\u201cbasic.\\\\u201d And my preferences in the realm of investing products are most definitely basic, too. I\\\\u2019ll admit that we got off to an inauspicious start on this front: Our very first non-401(k) investment was the niche-y and high-cost Templeton Developing Markets TEDMX, the result of me attending an early Morningstar Investment Conference and enthusiastically trusting the long-term prospects for emerging markets. We also dabbled in individual stocks early on, in that period in the late 1990s when everyone seemed to be opening a brokerage account. But our portfolio was largely anchored in core stock funds from the start. I had become an avid reader of Bogle, Jason Zweig, Bill Bernstein, and Jonathan Clements, all of whom enthused about the virtues of a minimalist, low-cost investing approach. My own cynicism about the investment industry grew, too, as I observed the all-too-familiar pattern of firms launching products only after an asset class had enjoyed a strong runup in the market. While we have steadfastly maintained a healthy allocation to non-U.S. stocks, which has certainly held back our results relative to a U.S. 60\\\\/40 allocation, that\\\\u2019s about as exotic as it gets for us. Just as important is what we\\\\u2019ve avoided: We haven\\\\u2019t bitten on alternative investment products, cryptocurrency, thematic funds, or any number of other investment fads that have come and gone over the years. I haven\\\\u2019t run the numbers, but I know ignoring the fads has redounded to the benefit of our long-term results.

While most analyses of the nation\\\\u2019s growth in wealth disparity analyze how wages have risen faster for high-income employees than for everyday workers (thus, the ongoing complaints about CEO pay), I included the effect of a second item: The Great Bull Market.Given that equity returns have overwhelmingly outstripped wage increases over the past half-century, and that wealthy Americans are much likelier to own stocks than their compatriots, the rise in stock prices has overwhelmingly helped the affluent.A valid argument. (If I say so myself.) Since the 1970s, the top wage earners have not only outstripped others\\\\u2019 incomes, but they have also benefited most from the stock market\\\\u2019s boom. Throw in the profits from real estate investing, which have also mostly accrued to the wealthy, and that\\\\u2019s quite the trifecta! The Missing Piece: Investment PsychologyBut of course, more can be said about the subject, which Bill Bernstein amply does in the newly released second edition of his 2002 classic, The Four Pillars of Investing. The book covers a wide range of territory: investment theory and history, financial advisory practices, and portfolio construction. But Its section on investor psychology best addresses what my argument omitted.(Note: I provided a back-cover blurb, but alas will not be receiving any of the book\\\\u2019s revenue.)When Bernstein wrote the first edition of Four Pillars, as a relative newcomer to the field, he was enthralled by the numbers. Investment research is bounded by science. In contrast with many of his quantitatively minded peers, though, he recognized from the start that investment math could also be a trap. History never repeats exactly\\\\u2014sometimes not even approximately. For that reason, he addressed investor psychology. Twenty years later, he has expanded on that message. The second edition opens by contrasting two investors: 1) the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, run by two Nobel Laureates, and 2) Sylvia Bloom, a legal secretary. The former belied its name by surviving only four years, while the latter persisted for 67 years, with great success. Writes Bernstein, \\\\u201cUnlike the geniuses at LTCM, [Bloom] wasn\\\\u2019t trying to get rich quick, but rather to get rich slow\\\\u2014a much safer bet.\\\\u201dThat sentence neatly summarizes Bernstein\\\\u2019s counsel. Speculators pursue high returns; investors seek appropriate returns. Four Pillars spends little time on the obvious forms of speculation, such as buying meme stocks or trading options. No need to beat that horse; the book\\\\u2019s readers either already realize the futility of tail-chasing, or they bought the book because they are ready to absorb that lesson.Four Pillars instead addresses the type of errors that educated investors might unknowingly make\\\\u2014and that Bloom did not. They include 1) becoming seduced by investment narratives, as made by intriguing but ultimately mediocre theme funds; 2) succumbing to recency bias; and 3) believing too strongly in one\\\\u2019s own abilities, thereby discounting the wisdom of the crowd. (Is the marketplace crazy? Perhaps. But that occurs far less often than most investors believe.) The Biggest MistakeThe most dangerous delusion, states Bernstein, comes not from how investors perceive the outside world, but instead from how they view themselves. The first edition of Four Pillars included a risk-tolerance table, to help readers establish their equity allocation. For example, investing 80% of one\\\\u2019s assets in stocks might lead to a 35% portfolio decline, under unusually bad (although not the worst possible) circumstances, while owning 40% would cut the loss to 15%.Writes Bernstein in the second edition:I neglected to ask whether readers had actually lost 15%, 25%, or 35% of their portfolio. Simply looking at this table or running a portfolio simulation on a spreadsheet is not the same as facing real-world losses. The stock market only rarely falls for no good reason \\\\u2013 bear markets are almost always the result of incipient financial system collapse, hyperinflation, or the prospect of nuclear annihilation. The fear of real geopolitical and economic catastrophe makes such times the most dangerous mountain passes on the highway of riches. That is, it is not enough to have been in the right place at the right time, as wealthy Americans have been during the past 40 years. Investors must also know how to convert their paper opportunities into tangible dollars, by making sound decisions that withstand the test of time. Underinvesting is an obvious problem, as one can\\\\u2019t pocket stock market gains without stocks. But overinvesting can also be a costly error. Getting rich slowly means finding the appropriate personal level.That conclusion may seem simple, but enacting it proves surprisingly difficult. Over the years, tens of millions of investors have crashed upon the asset-allocation rock. Such a fate, however, is unlikely to befall those who read Four Pillars. By the time the reader encounters Bernstein\\\\u2019s homily on risk perception, the book already established 200 pages of context, with another 100 yet to follow. The advice is therefore not hollow. It echoes.ConclusionMy previous two columns, on whether older investors have become too aggressive and the inadequacy of alternative investments, can broadly speaking be regarded as defending relatively high equity exposures. I am happy to defend those claims. If taken in context, they are (I believe) both accurate and helpful.But no investment argument tells the full story. Although also supporting the concept of holding stocks for the long term, Four Pillars does so from a different perspective. It not only complements my thinking but also sometimes challenges it. I learned a lot from reading the book.

As international stocks in general have fallen behind the U.S. market for more than a decade, emerging markets, which are generally defined as countries that have lower levels of income per capita and are making the transition to become more developed, have been even weaker.Over the trailing 15-year period through June 30, 2023, the Morningstar Emerging Markets Index has generated annualized returns of just 3.1% per year, compared with 4.1% for the Morningstar DM xUS Index. The picture looks even worse over the past 12 months. As developed-markets stocks have rallied to a 17.1% gain, emerging-markets stocks have gained just 4%. As a result, diversified emerging-markets funds (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) have suffered about $8.9 billion in net outflows for the trailing 12-month period through May 2023.These disappointing results notwithstanding, there are still valid arguments for investing in emerging-markets stocks. In this article, I\\\\u2019ll look at risk-adjusted returns over longer periods, as well as other reasons investors may not want to give up on emerging markets just yet. The Rise and Fall of Emerging MarketsBy definition, emerging markets should have greater growth potential than more established equity markets. As mentioned above, emerging markets generally produce less economic output relative to the size of their populations. As these countries become more industrialized and integrated with the global economy, rapid economic growth can follow, often accompanied by robust equity-market returns.That is exactly what happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dates back to the end of 1987, just as global economies were opening up and investment capital was flowing into markets that were formerly unavailable. As a result, rolling three-year returns for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index trounced more-developed markets by healthy margins through over most periods up until early 1995.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tRolling Three-Year Difference in Returns\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. The trend reversed in the mid-1990s following the Mexican peso crisis in December 1994 and the Asian currency crisis in 1997. Emerging markets fell behind their developed counterparts from 1994 through 1998, and lagged again in the tech correction in 2000. Driven by robust economic growth in China and rising global commodity prices, emerging markets then entered a secular bull market that lasted until the global financial crisis in 2008.After staging a strong (albeit partial) recovery in 2009 and 2010, emerging markets ran hot and cold in the following years. Both 2013 and 2021 stand out as examples of what can go wrong. Emerging-markets stocks fell about 17 percentage points behind developed-market issues in 2013, when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it planned to slow down its bond-buying program and tighten monetary policy. They fell out of favor again in 2021 because of market worries over slower economic growth and regulatory uncertainty in China, which makes up about 30% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. These dramatic swings in performance were accompanied by above-average risk levels. As shown in the table below, standard deviation for the emerging-markets benchmark has been about 30% higher than that of developed markets since 1988, and emerging markets have also been subject to more extreme drawdown risk. Recovery times have been prolonged, as well. After the painful drawdown during the global financial crisis, for example, emerging markets didn\\\\u2019t fully recover until nearly 10 years later.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tReturn, Risk, and Drawdown Stats (Jan. 1, 1998, through June 30, 2023)\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. However, emerging markets\\\\u2019 volatility has been partly offset by their relatively low correlations with U.S. markets. The correlation coefficient between emerging markets and the U.S. equity market has averaged about 0.66 since performance data started in 1988. As a result, adding emerging markets to a globally diversified portfolio (including both U.S. and non-U.S. stocks) has led to better risk-adjusted returns more often than not. To test this, I created two separate portfolios: One with a 30% stake in developed-market stocks and the remainder in U.S. equities, and the other with a 20% stake in developed-market stocks, 10% in emerging markets, and the remainder in U.S. equities. The emerging-markets version came out with better risk-adjusted returns in about 68% of all trailing three-year periods since 1988.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tRolling Three-Year Difference in Risk-Adjusted Returns\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Assessing the Odds Going ForwardWill emerging markets continue to add value going forward? There are a few key considerations. The dollar\\\\u2019s strength versus other major currencies is one of the most important ones. Emerging markets typically fall behind when the dollar strengthens, which is one of the main reasons they\\\\u2019ve lagged over the past 15 years or so. A strong U.S. dollar often hurts emerging-markets economies because it raises the cost of imports (including food and energy) and leads to less foreign investment.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tEmerging-Markets Performance vs. U.S. Dollar\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Valuation is another key consideration. Valuations for emerging-markets stocks have declined, leading some investors to argue that they\\\\u2019re currently undervalued. In terms of relative valuation, though, emerging markets haven\\\\u2019t declined all that much. Emerging-markets stocks typically trade at a discount to stocks from developed markets, partly reflecting their higher levels of political and economic risk. Emerging markets also have fewer safeguards for investor protection and can be subject to bribery and corruption. Over time, price multiples such as price\\\\/book, price\\\\/sales, and price\\\\/earnings are typically about 40% lower for emerging markets relative to the Morningstar US Market Index.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tEmerging-Markets Valuations vs. U.S. Market\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t      Viewed from this perspective, valuations for emerging markets don\\\\u2019t look all that compelling. The Morningstar Emerging Markets Index currently trades at about 11.4 times earnings for the trailing 12-month period, compared with a longer-term average of 13.5. Relative to the U.S. market, though, the P\\\\/E multiple is now 0.56, which is only slightly lower than the longer-term average of 0.59.Another argument frequently made in favor of emerging markets is their greater growth potential. Based on data from the International Monetary Fund, emerging markets made up about 58.3% of global gross domestic product and 86.1% of the global population in 2022. As markets continue to develop and modernize, emerging markets\\\\u2019 share of the global economy should expand. However, there\\\\u2019s no guarantee that the rapid economic growth many investors now expect will materialize, or that if it does, economic growth will translate into stock market gains for emerging markets.ConclusionEmerging markets\\\\u2019 growth potential and generally low correlations with more developed markets make them worth including in a diversified portfolio. A prolonged period of weakness in the U.S. dollar could also provide a tailwind. However, their higher levels of risk make deviating from the global market-cap weighting (currently about 8%) a risky bet.\",\"Article Author\":\"Amy Arnott\",\"Label\":\"Protfolio\",\"Article Source\":\"Morningstar\",\"Article Date\":\"Jul 10, 2023\"}\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/qqz_morning_invest_updated.json'}),\n",

That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here\\'s an explanation of how we make money.Credit cards can be useful in building a higher credit score and financing some of life\\\\u2019s more expensive purchases. Hundreds of credit cards are available, which raises the question: How many should you carry?For some credit-averse consumers, leaning on credit cards is a risky game that can lead to a debt spiral. For others, it\\\\u2019s an essential wealth-building tool that can expand their purchasing power and help them save.How many credit cards does the average American have?The average American has three credit cards, with an average balance of $5,525, down from $5,897 in 2020 and $6,494 in 2019. While less popular than traditional credit cards, retail credit cards still have a place in most consumers\\\\u2019 wallets. Most adults carry an average of 2.3 store cards.According to 2022 data from the Federal Reserve, 82% of American adults have a credit card. While this is the majority, it signals that a significant portion of Americans still do not carry a credit card.It also suggests that consumers can easily build credit with other types of loans like a mortgage, personal loan, car loan, and others. However, the numbers show clearly that credit cards are widely used and offer an accessible path to build a positive credit history.For consumers who want to use a credit card as their primary tool for building credit, they might start with a student card or no-frills secured credit card. These types of cards are typically easier to qualify for and won\\\\u2019t charge an annual fee. Once you\\\\u2019ve used a credit card and made on-time monthly payments, you might consider adding a new card to the mix.When it makes sense to get a new credit cardCredit cards are not all built the same, and there is no set number or specific type of card you should carry. Getting a new type of credit card could make it easier to pay down debt, finance significant purchases, build credit, start a business, and more.Some consumers may choose to go without a credit card and work on building their credit by taking on other types of debt.For others, the right mix of cards can help them save money and make it easier to reach their financial goals. Some of the most common card types include:Rewards cardsRewards cards can be useful for the cardholder who wants to save on travel, dining, and entertainment through cash back, points, or miles. If you\\\\u2019re a frequent traveler, issuers such as Chase, Capital One, Citi, and American Express all offer travel credit cards with lucrative rewards programs that can help you save on airfare, baggage fees, hotel stays, and travel insurance, among other services.Balance transfer cardsBalance transfer credit cards are another type of credit card that may be worthwhile if your priority is to pay off credit card debt. These cards make it easier for consumers to pay off debt faster without being bogged down by high interest charges.Cash-back cardsCash-back cards can help you save on some of your day-to-day expenses by giving you back a percentage of what you spend on different purchases. Once you\\\\u2019ve earned enough cash back, you can redeem it for a statement credit, check, direct deposit, gift cards, and more.Secured credit cardsFor consumers who have a thin credit profile, secured credit cards \\\\u2013 which require a cash deposit to open \\\\u2013 can offer a chance to showcase their credit habits and build their credit score.How to settle on the right number of credit cards for youLanding on the \\\\\"right\\\\\" number of credit cards for your financial situation will depend on your budget, your future plans, and your comfort handling multiple accounts, each with payments due every month. How much you pay for your rent or mortgage, utilities and other household expenses, savings goals, and other debt obligations will help you determine how much credit you can manage.If you\\'re considering a new credit card, think carefully about your habits and upcoming purchases.If you\\\\u2019re a frequent shopper at a particular store\\\\u2026Apply for a credit card that will reward you for the purchases you already planned to make. Say you cook most of your meals at home and make weekly trips to the grocery store, a credit card like the Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card that rewards your spending at the grocery store and doesn\\\\u2019t charge an annual fee can help you lower your food bill each week.If you regularly fill up your tank at the same gas station, or are planning a road trip, adding a fuel rewards card like the Citi Premier\\\\u00ae Card to your wallet can help you earn rewards points each time you fill up.If you have a major purchase on the horizon\\\\u2026The right credit card can help you make that bigger purchase more manageable. Say you\\\\u2019re upgrading your home with new appliances, a credit card like the Discover it\\\\u00ae Cash Back with a generous introductory offer could help you finance that type of purchase and pay it off over a longer period while lowering how much you pay in interest.If your credit card balances are creeping up on you\\\\u2026Adding the right type of card to the mix can be a key part of your repayment strategy. If you want to pay down some or all of an existing credit card debt, a balance transfer card with more favorable terms could cut down your repayment timeline. It may seem counterintuitive to add a new credit card to your plate if you\\\\u2019re struggling to make payments. Still, if interest charges are making it difficult to reduce your principal balance, a balance transfer card could work in your favor.The Citi Simplicity\\\\u00ae Card, for example, boasts a 21-month interest-free balance transfer period, then 19.24%-29.99% variable APR.Do you prefer simplicity vs. playing the rewards game?Some consumers thrive off the savings and perks their credit card rewards provide. However, this often comes at the cost of paying annual fees and being mindful of multiple monthly statements and various fee structures.Travel credit cards, for example, boast lucrative rewards, but they can also come with above-average annual fees. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, for example, charges an annual fee of $395, which may be more than some cardholders are willing to pay. But one major perk that can make this card more appealing is the annual $300 travel credit that Venture X cardholders will get back as a statement credit each year for bookings through Capital One Travel.If you are the type of cardholder who can keep tabs on multiple credit cards each statement cycle, you might benefit from having more than one credit card. Still, applying for a new credit card is a big decision, and with greater access to credit comes greater responsibility. If you don\\\\u2019t have a good handle on your budget, having more credit cards could become difficult to manage.How to start building your credit score with a credit cardHaving a credit card gives you opportunities a debit card doesn\\\\u2019t. You can build credit using other forms of debt, but credit cards can provide a more immediate route to hitting your long-term financial goals while, with some cards, trimming your day-to-day expenses.One of the pillars of credit-building and a key factor that credit bureaus and lenders consider is the length of your credit history, but building a good credit score takes time.For many cardholders, building credit with a credit card starts early. According to Experian\\\\u2019s 2021 State of Credit report, the youngest generation of cardholders, Gen Zers, carry 1.7 credit cards, on average, with an outstanding balance of $2,312.Cardholders often don\\\\u2019t have to wait until they\\\\u2019re 18 to start building credit. Consumers can start working toward that goal early as an authorized user on a parent\\\\u2019s credit card or with a student credit card and then grow into more complex credit cards as they learn to manage their credit and establish healthy financial habits.The same data from Experian shows just that. Over time, most consumers tend to see their credit scores trend upward. While the average Gen Zer\\\\u2019s credit score sits at 660.5, Generation Y and Generation X have an average credit score of 667.4 and 685.2, respectively. Boomers and the Silent Generation have even higher average credit scores that sit well over 700.How credit cards impact your credit scoreCredit cards can play a key role in building and maintaining a strong credit score, but the number of cards doesn\\\\u2019t always directly affect your score. A credit score is a number calculated by FICO, which stands for Fair Isaac Corporation, and others that predict how likely a borrower will repay a debt. It\\\\u2019s based on information gathered by credit reporting agencies.Your FICO credit score ranges from 300 to 850, with a score on the low end considered \\\\\"poor\\\\\" and a score on the opposite end of the spectrum deemed \\\\\"excellent\\\\\" or \\\\\"exceptional.\\\\\"So how do the major credit bureaus calculate your credit score? Well, they consider a few different factors.Your payment history: 35%Building a record of consistently paying your debts on time is the single most important thing you can do to increase your credit score. It shows you regularly meet your financial obligations and lenders consider it a sign that lending you money is a low-risk undertaking.How much of your credit you use: 30%Lenders want to know how much of your available credit you\\\\u2019re using, a measure known as your credit utilization ratio or credit utilization rate. Lenders consider a lower credit utilization ratio a sign that a borrower is paying their bills on time. It also shows how much credit you have available.Most experts agree that you should try to spend less than 30% of your total available credit. Pushing it lower, by paying your credit card balances in full each month if possible, is a practice that will boost your credit score, and lower your costs.Length of credit history: 15%Your score takes into account the average age of your accounts, the age of your oldest account, and the amount of time since you last opened a new account. Usually, the longer your credit history, the better your score\\\\u2014if you\\\\u2019ve taken care to make your payments on time and not spend more than you can afford along the way.New credit applications: 10%Credit card applications can hurt your credit score if you apply for multiple new cards in a short period of time. Every time you apply for a new credit card or loan, the lender will look closely at your credit history\\\\u2014also known as a hard inquiry. These hard inquiries can cause your credit score to drop a few points\\\\u2014for a period of time.A significant number of hard inquiries bunched together in time can be interpreted by lenders as a signal of unwise use of credit. Too many hard inquiries could not only ding your score, but it could make future lenders uneasy about doing business with you.Credit mix: 10%Your credit mix refers to the different types of revolving and installment debt that you carry. Lenders want to see that you\\\\u2019re able to manage different types of debt. Unlike installment debt which has a set payoff date and balance, revolving debt only requires a minimum monthly payment and allows borrowers to use as much or as little credit as they want.When considering how many credit cards you should own, you should consider how adding a new card to your wallet will fit into your monthly budget as far as your minimum payment is concerned, when you last applied for a new card, as well as your other debt obligations.Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

With accident forgiveness coverage, though, your premiums will not increase after your first at-fault accident claim.Whether accident forgiveness is worth the added cost depends on how you structure your policy and what sort of protections are most important to you. Here\\\\u2019s a deeper look at what accident forgiveness covers and whether you should consider adding this coverage option to your own policy.How accident forgiveness worksIn most cases, accident forgiveness applies only to the first accident you have or only one within so many years. It also generally only covers one accident per policy during that specific time period, not per driver. So if you get in an accident that\\\\u2019s forgiven, and then another driver on your policy, like your spouse, gets in another at-fault accident, you can expect your premiums to go up as a result.It\\\\u2019s important to keep in mind that your premiums may still increase at renewal time even if you qualify for accident forgiveness. That\\\\u2019s because your carrier considers many factors when setting your car insurance rates. Accident forgiveness just ensures that your premiums aren\\\\u2019t increasing because of a qualifying accident.Here are some other factors to consider about accident forgiveness.How much premiums go up after an accidentThe amount that your premiums increase after an accident varies depending on your carrier, location, coverage limits, and more. In some cases, you could see your premiums go up by 28% to 50% or more. Since no one can predict when an accident will occur, this can make accident forgiveness a pretty valuable feature on your car insurance policy.How long accidents stay on your driving recordIn general, an at-fault accident will be factored into your auto insurance premiums for about three years after the crash. Carriers may take into account the last three to five years of your driving record when setting your auto insurance rates, depending on the insurance company and even your state of registration.Carriers also factor in your claims history and driving record as part of their risk assessment process. They may look at accidents, non-collision claims, moving violations, and even arrests to evaluate you as a driver and potential customer. If you have an accident history, most DMV records will also note the severity of the crash and any resulting injuries, which can also lead to rate increases after an accident.Over time, you\\\\u2019ll find that your premiums will gradually decrease as a result of a previous accident, as long as you aren\\\\u2019t involved in another crash and maintain a good driving record.Is accident forgiveness worth it?The answer really lies in how much you\\\\u2019re paying for your auto policy and how much this additional insurance feature costs. As with most insurance products, that varies.Some carriers include accident forgiveness as a complimentary perk for safe driving. Others add a surcharge for different options, which could include:Automatic accident forgiveness for small accidents, where the total damages fall below a certain threshold.Tiered accident forgiveness where loyal customers are rewarded after being an accident-free good driver for so many consecutive years.Immediate accident forgiveness coverage, which protects you against one accident per year or policy period.All this to say: If your carrier offers accident forgiveness protection for free, it\\\\u2019s never a bad idea to take advantage of the additional coverage. If it\\\\u2019s offered for a cost, it may still be worth considering, especially if you\\\\u2019re already paying more than you want to spend for coverage. Having accident forgiveness on your auto insurance policy can give you peace of mind knowing you won\\\\u2019t be further penalized. Yahoo Personal FinanceMore ways to manage costs after an accidentFollowing an accident \\\\u2014 especially one that has impacted your premiums \\\\u2014 there are things you can do to slowly bring the cost of your insurance coverage down. Obviously, maintaining a clean driving record is paramount; over time, as the accident moves further away in your record, it will become less pertinent to carriers when calculating premiums.You can also look into defensive driving classes, and many carriers offer insurance discounts for drivers willing to download and use telematics devices that track your driving habits.With auto insurance premiums on the rise, many drivers want to do everything they can to avoid future increases. Accident forgiveness coverage is one such option, helping you avoid potential premium jumps following an at-fault accident.

The next drawing is Wednesday, Oct. 4, and according to the Multi-State Lottery Association, it\\'s the third largest jackpot in Powerball history.The last Powerball winning ticket was sold in California on July 19. Since then, there have been 32 consecutive drawings without a Powerball lottery winner.While the odds of becoming a Powerball winner are slim (1 in 292.2 million to be exact), it\\\\u2019s hard to resist daydreaming about what you\\\\u2019d do with all that money. But how much of the lottery prize would you take home after taxes? We\\\\u2019ll break it down \\\\u2013 and suggest five ways to safely invest your windfall.How are lottery winnings taxed?No matter how lucky you are, Uncle Sam will still come knocking. The IRS taxes lottery prizes differently depending on how the winner chooses to get paid. You have two choices: lump sum payout or annual payments spread over 30 years. In truth, most lottery winners opt for the cash lump sum upfront, even though it ultimately means fewer dollars in their pocket.What do federal taxes look like on a lump sum payment? The federal tax rate on any prize over $5,000 is 24%, which gets immediately deducted from your winnings. And for a large prize like the Powerball, that lump sum will also catapult you into the highest income tax bracket, so you\\\\u2019ll pay the top federal tax rate of 37% the following year.The annuity option gives you the whole $1.2 billion pot over a longer time span, but you\\\\u2019ll still see that 24% taken off the top of every payment. And for gigantic lottery prizes like the Powerball, you\\\\u2019ll also be in the highest federal income bracket come tax time and have to pay any federal taxes you owe beyond that withholding.There\\\\u2019s also the state tax billJust when you thought your windfall was safe, here come state taxes. How much you\\\\u2019ll pay in state income taxes depends on where you live. New Yorkers pay the highest state tax rate at 13%, but the applicable state tax rate across the country varies from 2.9% to 8.82%.Of course if your luck holds, you might find yourself in one of the following states that doesn\\\\u2019t charge state tax on income:AlaskaFloridaNew HampshireNevadaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasWyomingWashingtonWhat would you pocket after paying Powerball taxes?Counting your chickens before they hatch might be bad luck, but let\\\\u2019s say you win that billion-dollar jackpot. If you choose the lump sum payout, you\\\\u2019ll be paid $551.7 million up front.However, because your winnings are also subject to a 24% tax withholding, that cash value means you\\\\u2019ll only walk away with $912 million to put in the bank. Depending on your filing status the following year, that sum is also subject to a tax rate as high as 37%, which means that money dwindles down significantly before you even file your state tax return.If you\\\\u2019re willing to wait for three decades, the annual payments start at $18 million the first year and increase by 5% every year, topping $74 million by year 30. That\\'s before federal taxes.If you want to run the numbers and see the fine print, you can use the Powerball Taxes Calculator to learn more.5 investments that make lottery winnings pay offEnough with the tax talk. Let\\\\u2019s say you hit the jackpot (literally) and have joined the billionaires club. Here\\\\u2019s what experts say lottery winners should do to maximize the winnings and secure a less stressful financial future.1.\\\\u00a0Hire a financial adviserBefore you even roll up to claim the check, it makes sense to hire a financial adviser and a tax attorney or accountant who can help you manage your tax liabilities and invest money wisely.2. Diversify your banking strategyYou might think you\\'re being responsible for stashing money in the bank, but remember banks are only insured for deposits up to $250,000. So be intentional about where you\\\\u2019re putting your money and how you\\\\u2019re splitting it up.Learn more about high-yield savings, money market, and CD savings accounts.Find the best HYSA rates3. Pay off outstanding debtsIt\\\\u2019s going to be a big relief to live debt-free, potentially for the first time. Paying off outstanding loans like mortgages or credit card debt is generally a smart idea as it prevents interest from accumulating. However, keep an eye on your credit scores before leaning into living off cash on hand.4. Invest wiselyHaving extra income might tempt you to try new investment strategies, but be careful about jumping feet first into financial products you don\\\\u2019t understand. Stick with low-risk investments like bonds and safer stocks or equities for the first few months before branching out \\\\u2013 and get educated about the power of compound interest.5. Consider establishing a charitable foundationWhile you might choose to keep the fact that you won the lottery quiet, family and friends will inevitably find out. It\\\\u2019s helpful to have a charitable foundation set up to deal with requests or gifting strategies that won\\\\u2019t incur an additional tax burden.And last but not least, if you do win the Powerball, put your winnings to work living the dream without worrying about your bank account balance.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kaz Weida\",\"Article Date\":\"Tue, Oct 3, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How does pay-per-mile car insurance work?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/pay-per-mile-car-insurance-220144560.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Lyudinka via Getty ImagesIf you drive only occasionally, you may wonder if a standard car insurance policy is a waste of money. In most cases, it isn\\\\u2019t because car insurance is required in all US states except New Hampshire.But if you\\\\u2019re a low-mileage driver, it\\\\u2019s worth exploring pay-per-mile car insurance as an alternative to a traditional policy that can lower the cost of your auto coverage.Here\\\\u2019s how pay-per-mile coverage works, the pros and cons to be aware of, and whether it\\\\u2019s worth it to switch.Understanding pay-per-mile insurancePay-per-mile auto insurance works differently than traditional auto insurance. Instead of paying a set rate based on your location, vehicle, driving history, and other factors, you pay a base rate and a per-mile rate. Your monthly base rate is determined by your demographic information and driving history, and it stays the same. However, your per-mile rate may fluctuate depending on the number of miles you drive each month.If you\\\\u2019re a low-mileage driver who works from home, commutes a short distance or frequently relies on public transit, opting for pay-per-mile coverage could save you money. It can also be an attractive option for college students or retirees. But you\\\\u2019ll generally have to drive less than 10,000 to 12,000 miles annually to save on car insurance costs.Pay-per-mile coverage options vary by insurer, but many companies offer both liability-only and full coverage policies. Popular pay-per-mile options include these carriers:MetromileMile AutoNationwide SmartMilesAllstate MilewisePros of pay-per-mile insuranceCost savings: The biggest benefit of pay-per-mile insurance programs is the potential savings compared to a traditional car insurance policy. Low-mileage drivers could save a significant sum on premiums.Flexible coverage: With a standard policy, you\\\\u2019ll pay the same monthly or yearly auto insurance rate. But pay-per-mile coverage is more flexible, and your rate could be substantially lower if you drive less in a certain month.Potential discounts: Certain auto insurers offer discounts for those with pay-per-mile policies. For instance, you may be able to get a safe driving discount if you consistently follow the rules of the road.Cons of pay-per-mile insuranceLimited availability: Pay-per-mile auto coverage isn\\\\u2019t available in all states, and availability may vary by insurer. Likewise, your car may not be compatible with the telematics devices many insurers require for pay-per-mile coverage.Not for high-mileage drivers: If you drive more than 10,000 to 12,000 miles each year, pay-per-mile auto insurance will likely be more costly than a standard auto policy.Privacy concerns: Pay-per-mile insurers typically require you to add a telematics device to your car to track your mileage and driving habits, including your speed, miles, time of day, driving events, and even your location. Not everyone wants their car insurance company tracking them that closely.Coverage limits: While some insurers may have a long-distance road trip exception for pay-per-mile policies, this isn\\\\u2019t always the case. If you take road trips occasionally, read the fine print before getting pay-per-mile coverage.How pay-per-mile car insurance worksTypically, you\\\\u2019ll need to install and use a telematics device in your car to track your mileage and driving behaviors if you opt for pay-per-mile insurance. These small devices often plug into your car\\\\u2019s OBD-II port under the steering wheel. However, some insurers may allow you to take monthly photos of your odometer or download their mobile app for tracking as an alternative.Once you\\\\u2019re up and running with tracking, you can drive as you normally would, and your insurer will charge you a fixed base rate and a variable, usage-based mileage rate each month. So let\\\\u2019s say you pay a $35 base rate and a $0.06 per-mile rate in a given month. If you drive 135 miles that month, your insurance costs would be as follows:$35 + ($0.06 x 135) = $43.10Remember that if you drive a lot in a given month, your mileage rate may increase depending on your car insurance company. Ensure you familiarize yourself with rate structures before trading a standard insurance policy for a pay-per-mile program. Yahoo Personal FinanceIs pay-per-mile insurance worth it?Pay-per-mile insurance can be worthwhile for certain drivers to save on car insurance rates. But there are some important things to consider. If you\\\\u2019re considering switching to pay-per-mile coverage, determine if this coverage is available in your area and which insurers offer it.You\\\\u2019ll also want to evaluate your overall driving habits and track your mileage to determine if pay-per-mileage makes more sense than a standard auto policy. Consider whether the amount you drive changes month to month. If you find it does make sense, estimate potential cost savings by looking at your current policy and getting car insurance quotes from different providers.Finally, you\\\\u2019ll want to consider which coverage options you want. For instance, do you drive an older, high-mileage car? If so, a liability-only policy may make sense. If your car is newer, a full coverage policy that includes liability, comprehensive, and collision insurance may offer the protection you need.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Jess Ullrich\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is high-risk car insurance and who needs it?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/high-risk-car-insurance-194101085.html\",\"Article Content\":\"S-S-S via Getty ImagesIf you\\\\u2019re labeled a high-risk driver, you\\\\u2019ll probably find that buying auto insurance coverage is both more difficult and more expensive than if you were shopping for a standard policy. Drivers can be classified by carriers as high risk because of factors such as age, driving record, or claims history.Understanding your own high-risk factors and how they impact your insurance premiums is vital to finding the right policy at the right price.Understanding high-risk car insuranceHigh-risk auto insurance, also known as non-standard auto insurance, is a type of policy designed for higher risk drivers, or those who have been categorized by the carrier as more likely to get in an accident or file a claim. Each carrier\\\\u2019s definition and threshold of risk varies, but all may factor in your age, driving history, experience on the road, coverage history, and even the vehicle you drive.Nearly all states require a minimum amount of auto insurance coverage as a condition of owning and driving a vehicle. But because of these risk factors, certain drivers may be forced to purchase a high-risk car insurance policy instead of a standard policy.Because high-risk drivers are perceived as having a higher probability of claims and\\\\/or at-fault accidents, these policies can be more limited in nature and are often more expensive. Not all carriers offer high-risk policies, either, so you may need to shop around for insurance quotes to find the right policy or even shop through your state\\\\u2019s insurance marketplace.What puts a driver in a high-risk category?Insurance providers may determine a driver is high-risk who:Has a history of accidents and\\\\/or comprehensive claimsHas received numerous traffic violations or has been convicted of serious violations like DWI (driving while intoxicated), DUI (driving under the influence), reckless driving, and moreIs required by their state insurance department to file an SR-22 certificate following a driver\\\\u2019s license suspension or revocationHas no history of auto insurance or a large gap in coverageIs young and inexperienced behind the wheel, usually age 20 or youngerIs age 70 or olderHas a below-average credit score, outright bad credit or negative historyDrives certain high-value, high-risk, or specialized vehicles such as sports cars or antiquesWhile some carriers, like Progressive, go out of their way to avoid labeling drivers as \\\\\"high risk,\\\\\" having one or more of these factors will still influence your auto insurance rates and the types of coverage available to you.Effects of high-risk classification on car insurance costsInsurance carriers are all about mitigating risk, which is why your auto insurance premiums are personalized and largely based on these risk factors. If you have enough of these factors \\\\u2014 or very serious ones \\\\u2014 and are classified as a high-risk driver, your premiums will be even higher.Insurance companies reason that the more accidents you\\\\u2019ve been involved in, the more likely you are to file a claim in the future. The same goes for drivers who have a history of DUI convictions or multiple speeding tickets, and even for less-serious factors such as limited driving experience or poor credit history.High-risk classification can follow you for multiple years, meaning multiple years of paying more for car insurance coverage. To keep costs down, you can lower your policy limits and raise your deductible, or opt for liability-only insurance instead of full coverage. But keep in mind that lower coverage levels and higher deductibles can mean higher out-of-pocket expenses if you\\\\u2019re in an accident.It\\\\u2019s wise to shop around and compare quotes anytime you are in the market for auto insurance coverage. If you\\\\u2019re forced to buy a non-standard policy or have factors that make you a high-risk driver, this is even more important. Yahoo Personal FinanceWays to mitigate your high-risk classificationBeing labeled a high-risk driver makes insurance more expensive, but that doesn\\\\u2019t mean there aren\\\\u2019t things you can do to mitigate costs and reduce your high-risk classification over time.Improve (or maintain) your driving record. Your driving record includes your history of accidents, moving violations, and previous claims. If you are deemed a high-risk driver due to your driving record, you will need to \\\\\"wait out\\\\\" many of these blemishes (most carriers only consider the last three to five years\\\\u2019 worth). Even if your risk status is due to something else, maintaining a clean driving record can only help reduce your premiums and prevent other factors from impacting your coverage options.Choose a practical vehicle. An unsafe, high-value, or specialty vehicle can increase your premiums and even bump you into a high-risk classification. Instead, consider switching to a safer and\\\\/or more practical vehicle. Adding safety features can also help you qualify for discounts on your policy.Watch your credit score. While a carrier cannot deny you auto insurance coverage due to credit history alone, in many states your credit score can affect your premiums. Make sure that you are maintaining reasonable credit utilization and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, limiting hard inquiries and new accounts, and avoiding late payments.Take a defensive driving course. Many insurance companies offer discounts and rate reductions for drivers who complete defensive driving courses. Anything you can do to show insurance companies you\\\\u2019re a safe driver is a plus.Don\\\\u2019t let your coverage lapse. If you\\\\u2019re stuck buying a high-risk policy at a higher premium, it can be tempting to forgo coverage altogether. This is especially true if you don\\\\u2019t own your own car or rarely drive. However, a lapse in insurance coverage \\\\u2014 regardless of the reason \\\\u2014 can actually increase your risk level and, in turn, raise your premiums in the future. Instead of creating a gap in coverage, consider buying a pay-per-mile or liability-only policy, especially if you don\\\\u2019t drive much.Non-standard insurance and other alternativesIf you\\\\u2019re struggling with exorbitant insurance premiums or to find coverage at all, here are some alternatives to consider.Look into state-run insurance pools. Also known as assigned risk pools, state-run programs help link drivers with carriers willing to offer them coverage after they\\\\u2019ve been denied elsewhere. These policies are still expensive but can provide you with coverage when you haven\\\\u2019t had luck applying directly.Non-standard insurance companies. While high-risk auto insurance is sometimes referred to as a non-standard policy, there are also carriers which are categorized as non-standard insurance companies. These companies specialize in providing coverage to drivers with special concerns or needs, such as those requiring an SR-22 certificate, who are high-risk drivers, or who need a non-owner policy. These carriers often advertise themselves as being geared toward non-standard drivers and include companies like The General and Dairyland.Get added to someone else\\\\u2019s policy. In some cases, it may be cheaper (and easier) to get added to someone else\\\\u2019s existing auto insurance policy as a named driver, especially if you don\\\\u2019t own a vehicle. If you occasionally borrow your parents\\\\u2019 car, for example, they may be able to add you to their policy. Their premiums will likely see a big increase, but this may still be less than you\\\\u2019d pay for your own policy (especially if you\\\\u2019re denied coverage).If you\\\\u2019re still finding it difficult to secure affordable rates due to your high-risk driver classification, it may be time to call in some professional help. Some insurance agents and brokers specialize in working with high-risk drivers to find and build a policy that meets their needs.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Stephanie Colestock\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"The best personal loans for September 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/best-personal-loans-202034980.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Personal loans are a fast way to fund a cash need.

The best personal loans come in a variety of lump-sum amounts, and the loan funds can be used for many financial goals. Repayment terms may be fine-tuned to your monthly cash flow.No collateral required. Usually, unsecured personal loans are the most attractive to borrowers. Qualifying for an unsecured loan means you won\\'t have to put up your home, vehicle or other personal property to guarantee the loan.Lower interest rates than credit cards. With good credit, you\\'ll likely earn an interest rate lower than you\\'ll see on credit cards. And credit cards and home equity lines of credit usually have variable rates that have been moving higher recently. Personal loans often have fixed interest rates that don\\'t change.Easier to qualify for. The best personal loans have lower eligibility standards than major loans like a home mortgage. Lenders qualifying borrowers with a wide range of credit scores are a bonus.Fast funding. The best personal loan lenders have funding times as soon as the next day following loan approval.Personal loan drawbacksYour interest rate might be higher than expected. Because many personal loans are unsecured, your interest rate might take a toll on your budget. Consider the pros and cons of secured versus unsecured personal loans.Be aware of fees. Some lenders can sting you with multiple charges, like an origination fee and a prepayment penalty. Be on the watch for such nuisance fees during the application process.More debt. Let\\'s face it. Personal loans can be just one more thing to pay off. If you have a good to excellent credit score and manage debt well, you\\'re fine. But for those struggling in their current financial situation with a low credit score, think it through before taking on more debt.Features of the best personal loansThe best personal loans have a low fixed rate, offer a loan amount suitable for your financial goals, with affordable-for-you repayment terms. Outstanding personal loan lenders will also limit nuisance fees and offer credit score flexibility and responsive customer support.Let\\'s consider the loan options that define the best personal loans.Interest rates and APRInterest rates charged for personal loans have been rising recently, a byproduct of the higher rates instituted by the Federal Reserve\\'s effort to tame inflation. However, while the trend for personal loan rates has been moving higher, the rate you receive is based on your credit profile. The best personal loan lenders will offer borrowers the most competitive loan offers.Lenders will consider your credit score, which is a measure of your creditworthiness based on your history of repaying debt, such as credit card debt, vehicle loans and a home mortgage, if you have one.They will also review your debt-to-income ratio. That compares how much you owe on existing debt to your pre-tax earnings.Lenders call this risk-based pricing. They charge more interest (and fees) to borrowers with poor credit that seem to be at a higher risk of nonpayment. Excellent credit borrowers earn lower personal loan rates. The lower your interest rate, the less you pay to borrow money, and the easier it is to afford your monthly payment.You\\'ll often see an interest rate quoted as an APR. The annual percentage rate is your yearly cost of borrowing money and includes any fees or other charges. Looking at the APR ranges offered to you is an excellent way to compare lenders and find your best borrowing deal.Loan amount and termsYour best personal loan choice will be based on your needs and the repayment terms from the lender who meets your financing goals.Borrow what you need, no more. Lenders who identify a qualified borrower are anxious to offer the maximum loan amount they believe the customer can afford. That can be more than you need and put you on the hook for higher debt. For example, if you need $7,000 and the lender gives you a loan approval of $10,000 because of your good credit, stick with the $7,000. The average amount of an unsecured personal loan was $7,100 in the first quarter of 2023, according to TransUnion.Consider what monthly payment you can really afford. The loan terms are the amount you\\'ll pay each month and the number of months those payments will be required. The best personal loan will feature payment options with the shortest term length that allows a monthly installment payment you\\'re comfortable with.Personal loan fees and chargesAs with borrowing any debt, the interest rate, fees and other charges are the differences that separate lenders.Take your time during the application process. You can save yourself hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars over the loan term. Personal loan fees and charges to look for can include:A prepayment penalty. A fee is levied if you pay the loan off early. In effect, you\\'re being penalized for reducing debt. Avoid a prepayment penalty if you can.Origination fee. An extra charge to pad the lender\\'s profit. It is usually a percentage of the total loan, for example, 1% or 5%.Application fee. Another nuisance fee. It\\'s usually around $25 to $50 but can be as high as $500. You\\\\u2019re actually paying to submit a loan application.Document fees. A fee for processing the paperwork of your loan application. It shouldn\\'t be much, but again, another junk fee.The best personal loan lenders won\\'t charge most of the fees above.Late payment fee. You can\\'t avoid this one. If you don\\'t pay on time, you\\'ll get hit with a late fee. Getting behind on monthly payments will also negatively impact your credit score.Ask questions before you get a loan offer. There may be a lot of paperwork involved in the application process for your personal loan. If there\\'s something you don\\'t quite understand before loan approval, take time to get an answer from the lender.Credit score and eligibilityYou will want to know your credit score and credit history well before qualifying for a personal loan. That way, you can correct any errors or try to clean up any blemishes.The higher your credit score, the better your personal loan terms and the lower your monthly payment will be. Credit scores generally range from 300 to 850. Experian data reported the average FICO score in the U.S. was 714 in the third quarter of 2022.Current interest rates from a major lender, PenFed Credit Union, range from an annual percentage rate of 7.74% to 17.99%. That\\'s just one example. Top-tier credit scores will earn the most favorable interest rate.Some lenders will consider issuing personal loans to borrowers with bad credit. Of course, your repayment terms will be less favorable, and the interest rate will be higher. The installment payments may be out of your reach.Lender customer service and reputationYour lender choice is important. You want to find a provider with a good reputation, the services and perks you prefer and the most favorable loan terms. Shady, predatory lenders can put on a good front, but you want to peek behind the curtain and lower your risk of dealing with a \\\\\"bait and switch\\\\\" lender. That\\\\u2019s when you\\\\u2019re promised a tempting loan offer that turns out to have a much higher interest rate than you expected and requires monthly payments that you might not be able to afford.For the best personal loan:Look for lenders that allow pre-qualification. That means you\\'ll get a solid loan offer with detailed repayment terms before you make a borrowing commitment. You can compare personal loan interest rates among multiple lenders before starting the official application process.Investigate customer support. Does the lender offer an autopay option, allowing monthly payments to be drafted from your checking account? If so, does that provide you with an autopay discount and a slightly lower interest rate? Is there phone and email support during the hours you\\'ll most likely need assistance?Read customer reviews. Real-life reviews offer the best view of a lender\\'s reputation. Sort the reviews by \\\\\"most recent,\\\\\" if possible, to see the latest issues or complaints. Red flags can include last-minute changes to a borrower\\'s interest rate or loan terms just before document signing, disbursement or installment payment processing glitches, or issues with the functionality of a mobile app or website.Best place to get a personal loanUltimately, the best personal loan lender will listen to your needs and financial goals. You\\'ll receive favorable loan terms that reflect your creditworthiness, and be treated with consideration and respect.You might choose an online lender for a wide variety of payment options and delivery of loan funds the next business day. A financial institution where you keep a bank account may be eager to expand its financial relationship with you and offer the lowest APR. Or, a credit union may provide the best combination of service and loan terms.It\\'s all a matter of shopping lenders and loan offers. If you think about your largest purchases, say a vehicle or big-screen television \\\\u2014 a personal loan can rank right up there with the biggest financial decisions you\\'ll make.Sure, you\\'ll have the money in your hands for a moment. But then the monthly payments begin, with the loan amount mushrooming with fees and interest.How to apply for a personal loanFirst, know your credit score. That\\'s the credit profile that helps determine your interest rate. An excellent credit score earns the best rates. Credit bureaus often offer free FICO credit scores through financial providers.Consider the amount of money you want to borrow. Be realistic. Get what you need. A smaller loan typically has a shorter term length. Maximum loan amounts require monthly payments for a longer time and may impact your creditworthiness for future borrowing.Prequalify with two or three lenders. For a pre-qualification, you\\'ll want to ask for a soft credit check that won\\'t affect your credit score. See how the initial loan offers shake out. Keep an eye out for the lowest rates.Don\\'t rush your decision. Once you have two or three loan offers in hand, sit down and do a side-by-side comparison of each. Which lender gives you the best payment options and combination of loan terms and service? How much will you save over the life of the loan from the lowest APR offer compared to the least favorable? How quickly will the loan funds be available?Apply with the best personal loan lender for you. With an online application, the lender will order a full credit report, including your credit score. That may affect your creditworthiness, so be sure this is the lender you want to work with. Once you\\\\u2019ve completed the approval process and received loan approval, the disbursement should be issued in days, with some lenders offering next-day funding. Monthly payments will soon begin.FAQsHow does a personal loan work?A personal loan is a lump-sum installment loan issued by a bank, credit union or online lender, the best personal loans most often require only your signature, proof of steady income and a review of your credit history. You\\'ll make monthly payments for the loan term. You can use a personal loan for a variety of uses, but are generally prohibited from using one to pay off student loans, put a down payment on a home, or for investing purposes.Can I get a personal loan with bad credit?Yes, there are personal loan lenders with flexible credit score requirements that cater to borrowers with bad credit. However, you\\'ll likely pay at least an above-average interest rate. Or, the lender may require a cosigner, joint application or a secured loan guaranteed by collateral. The term length may be longer, as well.Can I apply for a personal loan with no credit check?A no-credit-check lender will likely offer smaller loans, shorter repayment terms and high interest rates. A secured loan with collateral may be an eligibility requirement. It can be a risky financing option. Payday lenders and buy-here-pay-here car lots are examples of no-credit-check lenders. Borrowers should know that such loans are best used for emergencies \\\\u2014 and only if they have bad credit and few other loan options.Can I use a personal loan to pay off credit card debt?Absolutely. It\\'s one of the most common purposes for a personal loan. Called a debt-consolidation loan, it requires a personal loan with an interest rate significantly lower than the annual percentage rates you\\'re paying on outstanding credit card debt. Paying off high-interest rate debt with a debt consolidation loan can have a long-term positive effect on a borrower\\'s credit score.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Hal Bundrick\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Prequalified vs. preapproved credit card offers: What\\\\u2019s the difference?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/prequalified-vs-preapproved-credit-card-180909329.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Yurii Karvatskyi via Getty ImagesThe offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here\\'s an explanation of how we make money.So you\\\\u2019ve received a letter congratulating you for getting prequalified or preapproved for a new credit card. The offer almost seems too good to be true. Just fill out the application, drop it in the mailbox, and wait a few weeks for your new card to arrive, right? Unfortunately, that\\\\u2019s not how it works.Being prescreened, preselected, prequalified, or preapproved for a new line of credit does not guarantee your application will be approved by the bank or financial institution \\\\u2014 it simply means you meet their initial requirements.So what\\\\u2019s the difference between prequalified and preapproved, and are they actually meaningful? Let\\\\u2019s examine this phrasing to help you understand those offers when you receive them.Credit card prequalification vs. preapprovalAlthough the terms are closely related, prequalified and preapproved credit card offers are not the same. If you\\\\u2019ve received either type of offer, it means that a lender has reviewed your credit history and determined that you\\\\u2019re a likely fit for its product. However, preapproved offers are often a better indicator that your credit card application will be successful.Both of these offers effectively reveal little more than eligibility. Some banks and credit card issuers use the words \\\\\"prequalified\\\\\" and \\\\\"preapproved\\\\\" interchangeably \\\\u2014 hence why you may occasionally receive \\\\\"prequalified\\\\\" correspondence through the mail.What does prequalified mean?The prequalification process often begins with you, the customer.For example, many bank websites allow you to see if you\\\\u2019re prequalified for their best credit cards before you apply. This initial application does not require a hard credit pull (which can impact your credit score), though they may run a soft credit check. Instead, you\\\\u2019ll often be asked to enter your annual income and other basic financial information so the credit card issuer can assess whether you\\\\u2019re a good candidate for that specific credit card.What does preapproved mean?Preapproved credit card offers generally show up in your physical and virtual mailboxes entirely unsolicited. In some cases, you may have never even heard of the card issuer before.With credit card preapproval, you can bet that the credit card company has more closely examined your credit report than with a prequalification. There\\\\u2019s a reason for this: Credit card issuers ask credit bureaus for an index of people with specific credit activity to help them narrow down worthy applicants.This is why these card offers might appear to know you eerily well. For example, if you\\\\u2019ve got good credit or carrying around $10,000 in credit card debt, you could receive a mailer encouraging you to consolidate $10,000 worth of debt onto a balance transfer credit card such as the Citi\\\\u00ae Double Cash Card or U.S. Bank Visa\\\\u00ae Platinum Card. The bank may have specifically requested a list of those with credit card debt of around $10,000 within a specific credit range. Customers who fit the profile may receive a \\\\\"preapproved\\\\\" offer.Thanks to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), a financial institution can\\\\u2019t send you a preapproved offer unless it includes a \\\\\"firm offer.\\\\\" In other words, if you are approved for the card, you\\\\u2019ll get the exact terms specified in the preapproval letter.What are preselected or prescreened credit card offers?To make matters more complicated, you may see the term \\\\\"preselected\\\\\" or \\\\\"prescreened\\\\\" in your mail. Put simply, you loosely fit a criteria the bank is trying to target. Issuers preselect customers using data similar to the preapproval process, but a successful application is less of a sure thing.For example, a business owner may get preapproved for The American Express Blue Business Cash\\\\u2122 Card, but a frequent traveler may receive a letter in the mail for the American Express\\\\u00ae Gold Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred\\\\u00ae Card.Do preapproved and prequalified offers affect your credit score?Receiving preapproved and prequalified offers do not affect your credit score, but accepting the offers and submitting an application will. Here\\\\u2019s why.Soft credit inquiryAlso known as a soft credit check or pull, lenders may do a soft credit pull when deciding whether to preapprove or prequalify you for a credit card. This type of inquiry does not impact your credit score.Hard credit inquiryA hard credit check or pull signifies to the credit bureaus that you\\\\u2019re actively trying to acquire new credit. You can expect your credit score to dip by a few points every time you experience a hard inquiry. This is because the credit card issuer will review how you\\\\u2019ve handled debt and credit in the past and use that information (along with other criteria) to decide to approve or deny you the line of credit.For example, if you\\\\u2019re preapproved for a credit card, the issuer has almost certainly performed a soft inquiry on your score to see if you\\\\u2019re a suitable candidate. If you decide to submit an application for the card, the issuer will then perform a hard inquiry, which will temporarily lower your credit score by a few points.Pros and cons to prequalified and preapproved offersThere are several wins that come with prequalified and preapproved offers. They\\\\u2019re more than just tools to help you understand your approval odds for a specific credit card.Preselected offers also give you the ability to \\\\\"rate shop.\\\\\" This is the act of finding the best terms on different credit cards before you commit. For example, when you prequalify for a card, the lender will often perform a soft credit inquiry and present you with ballpark interest rates based on your credit. You can do this with as many credit cards as allow for prequalification to find the option that\\\\u2019s best for you.There are tradeoffs, however. The frequent junk mail can accumulate quickly. And snail mail can contain information that could potentially help a scammer to commit identity theft.How to opt out of preapproved credit card offersIf you\\\\u2019d prefer to spare the square acre that\\\\u2019s deforested annually for the purpose of sending you garish advertisements, the FCRA offers a solution:Opt out electronically by visiting OptOutPrescreen.com or calling 888-567-8688. This will remove you from credit prescreening lists for five years.Opt out by mail (you must print and sign an opt-out election). This will remove you from credit prescreening lists permanently.However, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, credit card issuers can still acquire your information from alternate sources and continue to target you for financial products.From offer to approvalYour credit score and history play an important role in determining what kind of credit card offers you\\'re eligible for. Both prequalification and preapproval offers give you an idea of your approval odds without affecting your credit score. But until you submit that credit card application and consent to a hard credit inquiry, you can\\\\u2019t know for sure.Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

The Fed\\'s latest quarter-point rate hike on July 26 has led to some positive interest rate changes across personal finance tools, including savings accounts.For Americans thinking about opening a high-yield savings account (sometimes referred to as a high-interest savings account), interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are on the rise and could go even higher. Take a look at some of the best rates available from our list of federally insured banks below.What is a high-yield savings account?High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) are a type of deposit account offered by brick-and-mortar banks, neobanks (online-only banks with no physical branches) as online savings accounts, and by state or federal credit unions. As with traditional savings accounts, HYSA account holders typically don\\\\u2019t have debit card access or check-writing privileges, but may be able to transfer money between their HYSA and checking account with an ATM card or online.HYSAs have some of the highest rates available when it comes to financial products. An HYSA functions similarly to a traditional savings account, except you can earn much more interest. In some cases, you can get an annual percentage yield (APY) that is 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate.High-yield savings accounts typically have no minimum opening balance or monthly fees, though some banks may require you to maintain a certain minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge.Depending on the financial institution, you may earn the same rate regardless of your balance, or your APY may be tiered based on your balance.What is APY?A high-yield savings account\\\\u2019s rate measures the simple interest \\\\u2014 or interest earned on the principal you deposit in the account. APY is the rate of return earned on your savings account, including compound interest. Compound interest is the interest you earn on the money you deposit and the interest you earn on that money. Most savings accounts and CDs compound daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow.While HYSAs have some of the highest APYs available, those rates are variable. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY \\\\u2014 your rate may be great when you first open the account and then gradually decrease. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates.Where should I open a high-yield account?You can open a high-yield savings account at a financial institution, local bank, or credit union (it may also be possible to open an account online without visiting a branch, but that can vary by institution). Accounts at traditional banks may be subject to higher or more frequent fees, which often go to the upkeep of the branch locations. You also may be subject to any monthly withdrawal limits your bank may have in place.Because there\\\\u2019s no physical location with overhead costs to pay for, many online-only banks are able to offer HYSAs with higher APYs, and often don\\\\u2019t charge service fees \\\\u2014 plus, you can easily open and manage your account completely online or with an app.Pros of high-yield savings accountsHigher interest rates: You\\\\u2019ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account.Compounding interest: Interest compounds, helping you grow your savings. With interest earned via a high interest rate, your savings will grow exponentially.Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash your emergency fund, as your money remains accessible. Some accounts, like certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money earlier than planned when you open the account. Some accounts even offer ATM cards for easier access.No or minimal fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won\\\\u2019t need to worry about costs eating into your balance.Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), making them a very low-risk option for your money. FDIC insurance \\\\u2014 NCUA insurance for credit unions \\\\u2014 is government-backed insurance on bank accounts up to $250,000, which protects your savings if your bank or credit union encounters financial trouble.Cons of high-yield savings accountsVariable rates: Your savings account\\\\u2019s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates, they\\\\u2019re loosely tied to the Federal Reserve\\'s official interest rates. Banks may opt to decrease savings rates when the fed funds rate goes down.Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit.Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So while a $5,000 deposit isn\\\\u2019t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY.Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren\\\\u2019t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns.Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals.Tips on finding the best high-yield savings accountCompetitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs.New account offersLook at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open.High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account.Required depositsResearch applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount?FeesSome accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account.AccessibilityUnderstand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network?Deposit optionsReview available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM?Account linkingLook into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to being able to access your money.How to open a high-yield savings accountOnce you\\\\u2019ve determined the best high-yield savings account rates \\\\u2014 don\\\\u2019t forget to make sure you\\\\u2019re only looking at accounts from member FDIC or NCUA institutions \\\\u2014 and found a high-yield savings account that works for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You\\\\u2019ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver\\\\u2019s license, Social Security card or Individual Tax Identification Number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill.Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that\\\\u2019s the case, you\\\\u2019ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Yahoo Personal Finance\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to choose the best savings account for your kid\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/best-savings-account-for-kids-213224878.html\",\"Article Content\":\"It\\'s never too early to start teaching your child healthy financial habits. One easy way is to open a savings account for your child. Teaching your little one the value of a dollar and how to manage even small amounts of money properly are valuable personal finance lessons.Savings accounts can be a valuable tool in learning to set savings goals, track progress toward important money goals, and learn about the power of compound interest. Here are some things to remember when looking for the best savings accounts for kids.What is a children\\'s savings account?A children\\'s savings account is a type of savings account geared toward savers under age 18. Kids savings accounts fall into one of two categories:Joint account: A joint account is a savings account owned and managed by both the child and parent. This means that the parent and child have equal access to the account and can make deposits, withdrawals, and more.Custodial account: A custodial account is a savings account you manage for your child. In this case, your child is a beneficiary until they take ownership of their account once they become an adult.With joint and custodial accounts, many banks and credit unions offer savers the option to transition to a regular savings account once they become adults.One of the significant perks of starting early and opting for one of these account types is that you can teach your child about money management. Once your kids learn to save, they can transition to more complex financial products as adults, like managing a credit card, using a checking account, or saving money in a money market account.Where to open an account for your childThere are several types of savings accounts you can choose for your child. The right choice will ultimately depend on the kind of banking experience you want, if you wish to stick with your current financial institution, and the perks you value.A basic savings account at your bank: Most banks offer a traditional savings account, a standard deposit account in which you can put money and earn interest on your balance. The annual percentage yield (APY) you can expect to earn on that balance will vary from bank to bank.A savings account with your credit union: Credit unions differ from traditional banks because they are not-for-profit institutions. These financial institutions are run by members and for members. As such, you (or a family member) will likely need to be a member of a credit union to open a savings account for your child. The upside: because these institutions are run by members, you\\'ll likely pay lower or zero extra fees to run and maintain your account. Although, you should be aware that credit unions may have fewer physical branches compared to a larger bank, as well as a smaller ATM network. Credit unions may also charge a membership fee for banking with them.An online-only savings account: Anyone can apply for an online-only bank account right from their laptop or smartphone. One major perk of an online savings account is lower fees thanks to no overhead costs for brick-and-mortar locations, which can also mean higher interest rates. Like credit unions, an online-only savings account may not have an extensive ATM network, or any ATM network. You\\'ll also want to ask whether your account will come with a physical ATM or debit card.No matter which type of institution you choose to bank with, you must confirm its membership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). You might see this designation at the end of the institution\\'s name as \\\\\"member FDIC\\\\\" or \\\\\"member NCUA.\\\\\" Still, you should confirm with the official websites via the FDIC\\'s BankFind tool or the NCUA\\'s credit union research tool.When your deposit account is FDIC- or NCUA-insured, your deposits are federally insured up to $250,000 per depositor or credit union member, per ownership category. This way, if your bank fails, your money is protected.How to find the best savings account for kidsNot all savings accounts are the same. You should consider several details when choosing a starter savings account for your child.What\\'s required to open and maintain your savings account?When you open a new savings account, pay attention to the fine print. Your bank or credit union may have specific requirements in order to open an account. You might be required to make a minimum opening deposit, maintain a minimum balance in your account to keep it open or pay a recurring fee for account maintenance and services.There may also be stipulations about the minimum age necessary to open an account.Are there any fees associated with this savings account?In many cases, savings accounts designed for kids don\\'t usually charge additional fees. However, you should still ask your financial institution if there are any monthly maintenance fees or penalties you should be aware of. This could also be a good lesson for your child in understanding the terms and conditions of their accounts before agreeing to them.Kids accounts usually don\\'t charge monthly fees, but it\\'s still good to watch for any potential charges.Capital One, for example, offers a Kids Savings Account that doesn\\'t charge any monthly or maintenance fees and doesn\\'t require a minimum balance.Is it an interest-bearing account?Selecting an account that earns a high interest rate will help your child\\\\u2019s savings grow faster and teach them that it pays to save. Showing them how much they can earn over time may incentivize them to set aside more money now.If you go with a high-yield savings account, your child\\'s savings can grow exponentially over time \\\\u2014 even with a smaller balance.For example, Alliant Credit Union\\'s Kids Savings Account is currently offering a 3.10% APY, which is more than seven times the national average.What kinds of parental controls come with this savings account?Your financial institution will recognize that your child needs hand-holding as they navigate their first savings account. As such, you might find that your child\\'s savings account comes with specific parental controls built in.When selecting an account, read up on the settings and features of that account to determine if it\\'s the right fit for you and your child. Many accounts come with a debit card or prepaid card that your child can use to make withdrawals or pay for items on their own.Certain bank accounts will give you the option to set withdrawal limits on your child\\'s account or add a certain limit to a prepaid debit card so that they aren\\'t regularly dipping into their savings. You may also be able to set up text alerts to stay up to date on your child\\'s savings account balance and transactions.Does this account come with any extra features or mobile app capabilities?The goal of a starter savings account is ultimately to give your child a strong foundation and guide them so that they can manage their personal finances down the line.Many financial products geared toward younger consumers offer financial literacy and budgeting tools online or within your banking app. Giving your child access to their account via a mobile app and showing them how to monitor their balance, and deposit their allowance or a birthday check is one way to give them an added layer of financial independence and allow them to start taking ownership of their personal finances.Opening a savings account for your childCreating a new savings account for your child is a simple process. If you\\'re already a customer and plan to open a savings account with your current bank or credit union, you should be able to do so fairly easily.Remember, you\\'ll need to be a co-owner of the account, so you\\'ll need to provide both your information and your child\\'s information if you aren\\'t already banking with that particular bank or credit union.Some key information your financial institution will ask you for includes some form of personal identification for your child, such as:Birth certificateSocial security cardDriver\\'s license or state ID (if your child is a teen or old enough to drive)PassportMake sure your account grows with your childThe best savings account will be the one that grows with your child over time. In most cases, your bank or credit union will transition your child\\'s savings account into a regular savings account that they can then have sole ownership of and manage on their own once they reach age 18.Some banks may even offer account options that you can switch to before then that cater to teens or college students. Ask your financial institution about the options they offer for a longer-term account, once your child is of age.A kids savings account can serve as a building block in your child\\'s lifelong journey with their personal finances. When teaching your child about money management, part of teaching they how to manage their money involves having important conversations about where they keep their money and how carefully choosing an account can make all the difference as they work to reach their money goals.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ivana Pino\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to find the best checking accounts for September 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/find-best-checking-accounts-234120614.html\",\"Article Content\":\"A checking account is an essential tool in your financial life. It\\\\u2019s where you deposit your paychecks and how you pay your bills. And if you have the wrong checking account for your needs, you could end up paying unnecessary fees.The best checking account offers feature perks such as low minimum balances, no monthly fees, overdraft protection, and widespread ATM networks so you can access your money without added charges. What options are available vary by institution, so here is what you should look for when trying to find the best checking account for you.1. Understand your needsAll checking accounts have the same basic features: They allow you to deposit and withdraw money, and you can withdraw via check, debit card, or electronic transfer. But what kind of account is a good fit for you is based on your banking preferences.There are several types of checking accounts. Depending on the bank you choose, you may have the following options:Student checking: These accounts are intended for children or college students. They usually have low minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees.Senior checking: Senior accounts are for older adults, such as those 55 and older. They have low balance requirements, and they rarely have monthly fees.Free checking: A free checking account is open to anyone 18 or older. These accounts do not have monthly fees, so you can accept and make payments without paying service fees.Interest checking: Most checking accounts are not interest-bearing, so the money you keep in there won\\\\u2019t grow. However, some interest-bearing checking accounts allow you to earn interest, but they often have monthly fees or balance requirements.Rewards checking: A rewards checking account allows account holders to earn cash back or points on purchases. For example, you may earn 1% cash back on purchases made with your debit card. However, you usually must maintain a certain balance or complete a minimum number of transactions to qualify for the rewards.2. Research financial institutionsOnce you know the type of checking account you want, you can decide where to open it. You can open a checking account with either a credit union or bank.Credit union: Credit unions are nonprofit organizations, and you have to become a member to open an account. Because credit unions are nonprofits, their accounts tend to have lower checking account fees and better rates than for-profit banking institutions.Bank: Banks are financial institutions that are privately owned institutions licensed to offer bank accounts and loans. They typically operate multiple branches in several states, and some offer their services nationwide.Besides those two main categories, you can also choose between online and traditional institutions.A neobank or credit union allows you to open an account entirely online. Since an online bank doesn\\\\u2019t have physical branches, it has lower overhead costs, and it can pass those savings on to customers through lower fees and higher annual percentage yields (APYs). But they don\\\\u2019t have local branches you can visit when you need help.Traditional banks and credit unions often have online account management tools, but they also operate branches. They tend to have higher fees and lower APYs, but you can visit any branch to withdraw or deposit money.Regardless of which type of institution you choose, make sure it\\\\u2019s backed by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Member FDIC and member NCUA organizations provide deposit insurance up to $250,000, protecting your money if your bank or credit union fails.3. Compare fees and chargesChecking account fees vary by financial institution, so review the deposit account agreement for the checking account you\\\\u2019re considering to review all qualifying fees. The deposit account agreement is usually available through a link at the bottom of the checking account\\\\u2019s page in the fine print. If you can\\\\u2019t find it, email the bank or visit a branch in person and request it. Common fees and terms to look out for include the following:Monthly service fees: Monthly service fees, sometimes referred to as account or monthly maintenance fees, are what some banks charge to keep your account active. You pay the monthly fee even if you didn\\\\u2019t complete any transactions.Fee waivers: Some banks will waive the monthly fee if you meet certain criteria, such as maintaining a minimum balance or setting up direct deposit.Overdraft fees: Banks and credit unions charge overdraft fees when your account balance isn\\\\u2019t high enough to cover online or debit card purchases you make. The fee for an overdrawn account can be steep \\\\u2014 according to the FDIC, it\\\\u2019s typically around $35 per transaction.Non-sufficient fund fees: Non-sufficient fund fees are similar to overdraft fees. They occur when you write a check for more than you have in your checking account. The bank will decline the transaction but charge you the non-sufficient fund fee.ATM fees: Generally, banks and credit unions provide fee-free ATMs (in-network). But if you use out-of-network ATMs, they may charge you a fee (in addition to the service charges the ATM operator charges for using its machines).4. Think about interest ratesChecking accounts usually aren\\\\u2019t interest-bearing accounts, but there are some institutions that offer interest on checking accounts. However, the typical APY on these accounts is much lower than what you\\\\u2019d get with a traditional savings account.These accounts tend to have monthly fees or high minimum balance requirements, so they usually only make sense for those who keep a substantial amount of money in a checking account to cover their monthly expenses. Otherwise, your money will work harder for you in a high-yield savings account (HYSA).5. Consider added features and servicesSome banks and credit unions offer their customers additional features and services. For example:Mobile banking: Mobile banking apps are increasingly popular, especially if you like to keep an eye on debit card transactions and your daily balance, but not all banks have their own yet. If you prefer to use your phone for banking, check the bank or credit union\\\\u2019s mobile app availability.ATM fee reimbursements: Some banks and credit unions provide customers with rebates for out-of-network ATM fees. For example, you may be eligible for up to $20 per statement cycle in ATM withdrawal fee rebates.Free checks: Many banks and credit unions will issue customers their first box of paper checks for free.Online bill pay: Many banks and credit unions have online bill pay services that allow you to pay your utilities, credit card bills, and even subscription bills through your account. You can also schedule those payments in advance and set up recurring payments.How to open a checking accountNow that you know what factors affect the best checking accounts, you can pick a bank and open your new account.Whether you open the account online or in person, you will generally need to provide information about yourself so the bank can verify your identity. Below is a checklist of information and documentation you should have handy to open a checking account:Identification, such as a driver\\\\u2019s license or passportA second form of identification, such as your Social Security card, birth certificate, or utility bills listing your name and addressYour Social Security number or taxpayer identification numberMoney for the initial deposit (typically between $25 and $100)You need to fill out an application to open the account. The bank will verify your information and run a deposit account inquiry through a system like ChexSystems. If the bank or credit union approves your application, you can start using your account immediately, but it may take a few days to receive your debit card and checks. If you\\\\u2019re employed and receive monthly direct deposits, make sure you reach out to your HR or accounting department with your new banking information.Frequently asked questionsDo checking accounts earn interest?Interest-earning checking accounts do exist. Unfortunately, high interest checking accounts are rare \\\\u2014 most checking accounts have a low APY. Based on the most recent data from the FDIC, interest-earning checking accounts have an average APY of 0.07%.If you\\\\u2019re looking for an FDIC-insured account that offers high interest rates, a high-yield savings account may be a better option for your personal finance goals.Can I have two checking accounts at the same bank?Each bank has its own policies, but having more than one checking account with the same bank is usually possible for qualifying customers. Check with your bank to learn about the process for opening a second checking account. While some allow you to open another account online and link it to your online banking, others may require you to contact them or open the account in person.What are some alternatives to checking accounts?If a checking account doesn\\\\u2019t sound like the best fit for your personal finance goals, consider the following:Savings accounts: A savings account may be better if you\\\\u2019d prefer to build an emergency fund, save for a specific goal, or seek a higher interest rate than a checking account provides. These accounts often have monthly withdrawal limits and typically don\\\\u2019t come with account bonuses, debit cards, or checks.Money market accounts: Money market accounts have rates comparable to savings accounts but come with debit card access and checks. Monthly withdrawal limits may apply with a money market account.Prepaid debit cards: Prepaid debit cards are another alternative if you prefer not to open a new bank account and are accepted by most retailers. With a prepaid card, you can spend up to the full deposit amount added to the card. Once you\\\\u2019ve spent your card\\\\u2019s balance, you can reload it. Note: these cards typically have high fees.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kat Tretina\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to find the best online checking account for September 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/best-online-checking-account-180614848.html\",\"Article Content\":\"nazarkru via Getty ImagesThese days, you probably turn to the internet for news, entertainment, and shopping \\\\u2026 so why not your checking account?Online checking accounts make it easier than ever to manage your money without ever having to step foot in a bank branch. Plus, they often come with lower fees and higher interest rates than traditional checking accounts. Here\\\\u2019s what you should know if you\\\\u2019re considering opening one.What is an online checking account?An online checking account is just that \\\\u2014 a checking account that you can open and manage via the web without having to visit a local branch. These accounts are offered by traditional banks, credit unions, and online-only banks.You might be wondering why anyone would want a bank account that exists only online. After all, doesn\\\\u2019t that make it harder to manage your money and keep it safe from hackers?Quite the opposite, actually. Online checking accounts come with several benefits:Access anywhere: You can view your balance, make deposits, pay bills, and more, as long as you have a computer and internet access.Bank from your phone: Many banks that offer online checking accounts also have a mobile app, allowing you to do all the above tasks from your phone or tablet too. Most allow for mobile check deposit, where you can deposit a check to your account by snapping a picture of it.Electronic transfers: Online checking accounts allow for electronic bill payment and transfers between accounts and even between different banks, eliminating the need for writing checks or visiting a physical location.ATM networks: Worried about how you\\\\u2019ll pull out cash? You\\\\u2019ll still need to visit an ATM for this task, but you aren\\\\u2019t limited to your bank\\\\u2019s locations. Most providers of online bank accounts are part of national ATM networks, such as Allpoint or Co-op. These allow checking account customers to use any ATM in the network without incurring a fee.Lower fees: Because online accounts don\\\\u2019t come with the same administrative overhead costs as traditional accounts, those savings are often passed on to account holders in the form of lower (or no) fees. In some cases, the interest rates may be higher too.Safety: A common misconception about online banking is that it\\\\u2019s not as safe as banking in person. However, an online checking account comes with the same \\\\u2014 if not more \\\\u2014 protections thanks to technology. Of course, it also requires some work on your part to keep your online banking information safe.Security measures and fraud protectionSpeaking of safety, it\\\\u2019s important not to downplay the risks that come with managing your financial life online. However, the best online checking accounts should have robust security measures in place. And there are things you can personally do to keep your banking information out of the hands of identity thieves.For one, your bank\\'s website and mobile apps should use strong encryption to protect your personal and financial information. Many banks also employ two-factor authentication, which requires you to verify your identity using two separate methods before you can access your account. For example, after entering your password, you might have to enter a code sent to your phone.Another security measure to look out for is automatic logout. If you\\'re inactive on your online account or mobile app for a certain period, the bank should automatically log you out of your account. This helps to protect your information if you accidentally leave your device unattended.Many banks also offer customizable alerts for various account activities. You might set up alerts for things like large transactions, login attempts from unknown devices, or when your balance falls below a certain level. But even if you don\\\\u2019t set up personalized alerts (though it\\\\u2019s really a good idea), your financial institution should be regularly monitoring your accounts for unusual activity. If they notice anything suspicious, they may contact you to confirm the activity or block the transaction.Additionally, you can take these steps to enhance your security:Use a strong, unique password for your banking accounts.Regularly update your devices and banking apps to ensure you have the latest security patches.Be aware of phishing attempts and never click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited messages.Regularly review your account statements and transactions for any suspicious activity.Use secure networks when accessing your banking accounts online.Is an online checking account right for you?Despite the many benefits, an online account isn\\\\u2019t for everyone. Before opening an online checking account, it\\\\u2019s important to take stock of your biggest financial goals and priorities.For example, if you\\\\u2019re looking for a high-yield checking account with no monthly fee and an expansive ATM network, an online account is probably a good choice. On the other hand, if you handle a lot of daily transactions and often need to visit your local bank branch to get assistance from a teller, an online checking account probably won\\\\u2019t meet your needs.How to find the best online checking accountWhen it comes to opening an online checking account, the choices can seem overwhelming. There are more than 350 digital banks alone. Plus, many brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions offer online accounts. So how do you go about selecting the right one? Here are some important factors to consider:Fees and minimum balance requirementsThe fees associated with an online checking account are one of the most important factors to consider. Fees can hurt your bottom line and wipe out any interest earnings or rewards your account offers.For example, some financial institutions charge monthly maintenance fees. These fees are meant to cover the administrative costs of servicing your account. But they can often be waived by meeting certain requirements such as maintaining a minimum balance or signing up for direct deposit.It\\\\u2019s also common for banks to charge a non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee if your account doesn\\\\u2019t have enough money in it to cover a transaction. The average NSF fee currently stands at $34. However, some banks have committed to eliminating these fees, including Bank of America, Capital One, and Wells Fargo.You may also be charged fees for using out-of-network ATMs, receiving paper statements, and more. So before applying for an online checking account, be sure you understand all of the fees and how to avoid them or have them waived. Ideally, you will choose an account that doesn\\\\u2019t charge these types of fees at all (yes, they exist).Interest ratesChecking account rates are generally lower than savings account rates. And the primary purpose of a checking account is to manage daily transactions, not grow long-term savings. That said, it can be nice to earn a little extra return on the money you have sitting in your account.Currently, the average checking account rate is just 0.07%. However, some high-yield online checking accounts offer rates of 1%-2% or more.ATM accessIf you use cash frequently, you\\\\u2019ll definitely want to consider the bank\\'s ATM network. For one, it\\\\u2019s important that there are many ATMs available across the country in case you\\\\u2019re traveling. Again, banks and credit unions that provide online checking accounts often belong to surcharge-free ATM networks that allow account holders to access their funds from many places, not just where the bank is located. Additionally, some online banks reimburse any fees incurred for using out-of-network ATMs.Digital banking toolsSince you\\'re considering an online checking account, the bank\\'s digital features will be even more important, including the usability of their mobile app and online banking platform. Find out if the account comes with features such as mobile check deposit, bill pay, money transfer options, real-time alerts, etc. \\\\u2014 all of which will help you manage your account from home (or anywhere else).Customer service and reputationSince online banks don\\\\u2019t have physical branches, look for a bank with strong customer service that can be reached through various channels, such as phone, email, live chat, and even social media. Check if they offer 24\\\\/7 support, and through which channels.You\\\\u2019ll also want to find out whether the bank is reputable in general. Sites such as the Better Business Bureau and Trust Pilot can give you an idea of what other customers\\\\u2019 experiences have been. Comb through reviews and see if you notice any themes regarding account issues.You\\\\u2019ll also want to double-check that the institution is insured. For banks, deposit insurance is provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). For credit unions, it\\\\u2019s the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). These entities ensure your money is protected in case the institution fails, up to a limit of $250,000 per depositor.How to open and manage an online checking accountOnce you\\\\u2019re ready to open a checking account online, the process is pretty straightforward.Start by gathering key documents. When filling out the application, you\\\\u2019ll need to provide some documentation. That may include a copy of your driver\\\\u2019s license, Social Security card, or passport to verify your identity. You may also need to provide proof of address in the form of a utility bill or bank statement. Having these items on hand before you get started will help streamline the process.Fill out an online application. This usually takes just a few minutes. Answer the questions in the application and upload any requested documents. Double-check that all your information is correct before submitting, as errors can delay the process.Fund your account. There may be a small minimum opening deposit required. The easiest way to fund the new account is by transferring the money from another account, but you may also be able to write a check.Set up online banking features and tools. Once your account is officially open, you can sign up for online banking, get any direct deposit in place, and activate your debit card.Monitor your account security. Your job isn\\\\u2019t done once the account is open. Make sure you stay vigilant when it comes to protecting your account. Regularly check on your transaction activity, set up bank alerts, and periodically change your password.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Casey Bond\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"The best money market accounts for September 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/high-yield-money-market-accounts-170614474.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Money market accounts (MMAs) are personal finance savings accounts, a hybrid of checking and savings accounts. You can often earn a higher interest rate than a savings account and get flexible access to your funds like a checking account.And yields are edging higher. As a result of the Federal Reserve\\'s latest rate hike on July 26, interest rates are rising on bank deposit accounts. And the best high-yield money market accounts are showing some of their most impressive rates in years.Opening a money market account can help you work toward and accomplish your short-term savings goals, and finding a money market account with a high annual percentage yield (APY) can help you maximize your efforts.Types of money market accountsAs with savings accounts, there are two types of MMAs: traditional and high-yield accounts. Traditional money market accounts offer relatively low interest rates, albeit better than most traditional savings accounts on average.In contrast, high-yield money market accounts offer interest rates that are much higher than traditional money market accounts. That said, they may or may not offer higher APYs (percentage of growth earned through compound interest over one year) compared to some high-yield savings accounts.How do money market accounts work?Here\\'s a breakdown of how money market savings accounts work, along with some of the most common account features:Interest: You can expect to earn interest on your balance, typically at a higher rate than traditional checking and savings accounts. That said, interest rates can vary depending on the financial institution and the type of money market account you choose. Also, some financial institutions may offer tiered rates based on your balance.Quick access to funds: Like a checking account, you can typically access your money using a debit card, an ATM card, logging into your account online, or via bank transfer. MMA accounts also often offer check-writing privileges. That said, account holders may be limited to six monthly withdrawals, a feature often shared with savings accounts. After that, your bank or credit union may charge an excessive withdrawal fee or even decline your requests.Fees: Like checking accounts, some money market accounts charge fees, including monthly fees and ATM fees, though thos fees may be waived if you meet certain criteria.Insurance: Like other deposit accounts, the funds in your money market account are typically federally insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). An NCUA- or FDIC-insured MMA will be covered up to $250,000.Balance requirements: Minimum balance requirements can vary, but in some cases, you may need to meet a certain minimum balance or initial deposit requirement to avoid a monthly fee or earn interest.Understanding yieldMoney market accounts offer interest on your deposits, either at a set rate regardless of your balance or on a tiered basis, with various rates based on your balance.But like other interest-bearing bank accounts, MMAs compound the interest you earn, typically daily, and pay it out monthly. Compounding interest increases your yield because interest accrues not only on your principal balance but also on the interest accumulated since the last time you were paid.For example, if you have a $10,000 balance in an account with a 4% interest rate, you\\'d earn roughly $1.10 in interest on Day 1. On Day 2, the bank or credit union will apply the same interest rate to a balance of $10,001.10 instead of $10,000.Because of compounding interest, the APY on your account will be higher than your interest rate. To calculate APY, you\\'ll use the following formula:APY = (1+r\\\\/n)n - 1In this equation, \\\\\"r\\\\\" is the account\\'s annual interest rate in decimal form, and \\\\\"n\\\\\" is the number of compounding periods in a year.APY exampleLet\\'s say you have a money market account that earns a 4% interest rate and compounds interest daily. To calculate the APY for the account, fill out the equation as follows (note that you\\'ll likely need a calculator for the exponen)t:(1 + .04\\\\/365)365 - 1(1 + 0.000109589041096)365 - 11.000109589041096365 - 11.0408084931325 - 10408084931325 or 4.08%While the APY typically isn\\'t much higher than the interest rate, it can give you a more accurate idea of what you can expect to earn on your deposits.Factors affecting money market yieldsSeveral factors will impact how much you earn in a money market account. Here\\'s what you can expect and how to compare account options:Interest rates: Money market account interest rates are variable and can change at any time based on market conditions \\\\u2014 the highest APY available now may be lower or higher in the future, depending on the Fed. Additionally, with some financial institutions, your MMA rate may vary depending on how much money you have in the account.Balance: The account\\'s interest rate will be applied to your balance, so as your balance grows, so will the amount of interest you earn. Keep in mind that some financial institutions require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest.Account fees: Some banks charge monthly maintenance fees on their money market accounts, which eat into your yield. In some cases, though, you may be able to get the fee waived if you maintain a certain balance. Many financial institutions also charge an excessive withdrawal fee if you withdraw money more than six times in a month.As you compare your money market account options, consider whether the accounts you\\'re considering have a flat or tiered rate structure and how often interest compounds. You\\'ll also want to look for minimum opening deposit and ongoing balance requirements.Finally, make sure you know what fees each account charges. If it\\'s possible to waive the monthly service fee, determine whether you can meet the requirement to earn the waiver.How to find the best money market accountWhile it may be tempting to open a money market account with the bank you already have a relationship with, take your time to shop around and compare APYs from multiple sources to ensure you get the best offer available.For the most part, online banks offer the best money market account rates. But you can also find solid options with state and federal credit unions, and even some traditional banks.Run a quick search online for the best money market accounts, and several resources will pop up to help you compare the top options available.In addition to interest rates, fees, initial deposit amount needed, and balance requirements, check to see if you\\\\u2019ll have easy access to your money market funds.Tips for maximizing money market yieldsDepending on your situation, you may be able to take advantage of different opportunities to make the most of your short-term savings. Here are just a few to consider:Automate your savings: Instead of saving money that\\'s left over at the end of the month, incorporate your savings into your budget to ensure you\\'re saving the amount you want each month.Choose the right account for your balance: If you have a sizable savings balance, you may earn a higher APY with a bank or credit union offering higher yields on larger deposits.Take advantage of promotional offers: It\\'s not common for banks to offer promotional APYs on money market accounts, but still watch out for them as you shop around. Just make sure you read the fine print for the offer to understand how long the promotion lasts and the potential limitations.Minimize your fees: If you can find a money market account with a high APY and no monthly fee, you\\'ll need to make sure you limit your withdrawals if there\\\\u2019s a withdrawal limit in place. However, if the account you want charges a monthly fee, consider whether you can get that fee waived each month if you keep a higher minimum balance.Risks and considerationsWhile money market accounts can be a great place to stash short-term savings, there are some potential pitfalls to watch out for:Your earnings won\\'t outpace inflation: While some of the highest-yielding money market accounts can beat out a high-yield savings account, they typically don\\'t offer a high enough APY to compensate for inflation. As such, they\\'re typically not the best option for long-term financial goals.Repeatedly exceeding your withdrawal limit could create greater consequences: You may not be concerned about an excessive withdrawal fee here and there. But if you exceed your monthly withdrawal limit regularly, your bank or credit union could decline your withdrawal requests or even close your account.Insurance coverage has limits: Like other bank accounts, money market accounts are safe and typically come with protection in the event that your bank or credit union fails. Both the FDIC and NCUA offer $250,000 in coverage per institution, per depositor, per ownership category. That should cover most people, but individuals with high net worths may need to spread out their funds across multiple institutions to maximize their protection.As you consider these potential risks, shop around and compare other types of banking products, including the best high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit, to determine which one best fits your personal finance goals.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to find the best CD rates for September 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/find-best-cd-rates-165749654.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Average CD interest rates have been trending upward at financial institutions nationwide. The most savvy consumers know that if you take the time to do your research, you can often find deals that are much better than average.The guide below will help you review the basics of how CDs work and provide you with tips on how to find the top CD rates today. You\\\\u2019ll also learn about how the Federal Reserve affects CD rates, current CD rate trends, and the details you should consider when choosing a CD beyond the interest rate a bank or credit union offers you.How CDs workA certificate of deposit (CD) is a special type of interest-bearing account you can open by depositing a lump sum with a traditional bank, state or federal credit union, or online bank. Credit unions call CDs share certificates.A certificate of deposit usually has a fixed interest rate higher than other deposit accounts, such as savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, and money market accounts. In exchange for this more competitive, fixed annual percentage yield (APY), you must agree to leave your cash in the account for a set period of time, called the CD\\\\u2019s term.If you decide to withdraw your funds before the end of the CD term length, your bank will usually charge you an early withdrawal penalty. An early withdrawal penalty could offset some or all of the interest you earn on a CD. In some cases, you could even lose some of your initial deposit. Therefore, it\\\\u2019s important to be strategic about your savings options and only lock up money in a CD that you\\\\u2019re confident you won\\\\u2019t need to access until the account matures.Pros and cons of a CD accountProsCD\\\\u2019s are a great intro to personal finance tools. Unlike the stock market, CDs offer safe, reliable returns with no rate changes.CDs offer fixed interest rates with higher returns on average compared with other deposit accounts.When you open a CD at a federally insured bank or credit union, that CD is insured up to $250,000.Opening a CD may discourage you from tapping into your savings early.ConsYou\\'ll typically pay an early withdrawal penalty if you need your cash before a CD\\\\u2019s maturity date.The competitive rates on CDs \\\\u2014 especially longer-term CDs \\\\u2014 might not keep up with inflation.The minimum balance needed to open a CD may be too high.Although CDs are safer, they offer lower returns than mutual funds and stocks.Types of CDsIn addition to traditional certificates of deposit, there are several other types of CD to consider.Bump-up CDsWith a bump-up CD, you can request an increase in your APY if interest rates rise at your financial institution before your CD matures. Generally, it\\\\u2019s a one-time-only request per term with a bump-up CD. Initial APYs on bump-up CDs are often lower.Step-up CDsStep-up CDs are similar to bump-up CDs. However, with a step-up CD, your financial institution will increase your APY at predetermined times.Callable CDsA callable CD gives the bank the right to terminate the CD before its maturity date. A callable CD might offer a higher APY than a traditional CD.No-penalty CDsA no-penalty CD allows you to take funds from your account before the maturity date without paying an early withdrawal penalty. No-penalty CD rates are usually lower than the APYs on traditional CDs.Bull CDsThe interest you earn on bull CDs is tied to a specific market index. If that market index rises, a bull CD will pay you a predetermined percentage in the form of interest. Most bull CDs also feature a guaranteed minimum rate of return.Bear CDsBear CDs are also tied to a specific market index, but the returns you may earn from a bear CD are based on shares of any market declines that occur.Jumbo CDsWith a jumbo CD, a bank requires a larger opening minimum deposit requirement \\\\u2013 often $100,000 or more \\\\u2013 than it would for a traditional CD. If you don\\\\u2019t have quite enough to meet the minimum deposit, you could put the money you do have into a high-yield savings account or money market account to earn the interest you need to open a jumbo CD.Uninsured CDsUninsured CDs are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Uninsured CDs may offer a higher APY, but think carefully and consider seeking professional advice before you commit to a higher-risk account that isn\\\\u2019t a member FDIC or NCUA. The FDIC and NCUA cover up to $250,000 per depositor and account category if your financial institution fails. You won\\\\u2019t have that safety net with an uninsured CD.Variable-rate CDsWith regular CDs, you have a fixed rate through the entire CD term. When you open a variable-rate CD, the APY can fluctuate with market interest rates. If interest rates increase, you\\\\u2019ll earn more on your savings. But if rates fall, your APY could drop.Zero coupon CDsZero coupon CDs don\\\\u2019t pay interest during their term. Rather, you purchase the CD at a discount. When the CD matures at the end of its term, the bank pays you its full face value.How to save with CDsBelow are three common CD savings strategies to consider.CD ladderCD laddering is a savings strategy that involves opening multiple high-yield CDs with staggered maturity dates (i.e. a mix of shorter-term CDs and longer-term CDs). By spacing out the dates at which your CDs mature and then reinvesting your savings into longer-term CDs as your current ones come due, this methodology allows you to maintain access to a portion of your savings at periodic intervals while still earning higher returns than with a savings account.CD barbellA CD barbell involves dividing your savings between CDs with long-term and short-term accounts with no medium-term options.CD bulletA CD bullet is useful for saving toward a big financial goal. You open several CDs with similar maturity dates with the goal of having money from multiple CDs available at once.How to choose a CDWhen choosing a CD, consider the following factors:Rates: Banks and credit unions control their rates, so you\\\\u2019ll find that the APYs on CDs can vary widely between financial institutions. Shop around to find the best rates.Rate type: When looking at your CD options, compare APYs and determine whether the CD has a fixed or variable APY.Term: CDs have different term lengths. Some are as short as one month; longer-term CDs can have terms as long as 10 years.Penalties or monthly fees: With a typical CD, you pay a penalty if you withdraw the funds from your CD early (before its maturity date). You could lose some or all of your earned interest, and even part of your principal in some cases. Additionally, check to see whether or not you\\\\u2019ll be charged maintenance feesMinimum opening deposit: The minimum opening deposit for a CD will vary by bank or credit union, typically ranging from $500 to $5,000.CD rates todayThe average interest rate on a one-year CD is 1.72% as of August 2023, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. However, the top picks for the best CD rates far exceed the national average. Current CD rates are some of the highest CD rates in more than two decades. Combine falling inflation with U.S. banks starved for deposits, and the result: a nearly unmatched total return on cash. One-year CD yields are pushing past 5% and edging ever closer to a compelling 6% yield.The last time CDs paid high rates over 5.5% was in January 2001 \\\\u2014 though they came close in the summer of 2007, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. When you shop around and compare rates from different banks, you can find one-year CD interest rates that are more than triple the national average.Shopping for the best CD rates by termThe term of your CD \\\\u2014 the length of time it takes your CD to mature \\\\u2014 can also affect the interest rate a bank offers you. In general, long-term CDs are thought to feature higher APYs as a benefit of letting the bank hold onto your cash for a longer period. But longer terms don\\\\u2019t always equal higher interest rates with CD investing.In the current market, it\\\\u2019s true that average interest rates increase between one-month and one-year CDs. Yet, at the moment, that upward interest rate trend isn\\'t consistent with all longer-term CDs. Rates from the FDIC show two-year CDs have an APY of 1.47%, but a five-year CD sits at 1.37%, roughly 6.8% less than a two-year CD. As you can see, today\\'s best CD rates aren\\\\u2019t necessarily tied to accounts with the longest terms.Are CD rates going up?The federal funds rate is a target interest rate range that US banks charge one another to borrow excess reserves overnight. This rate influences both the interest rates that consumers pay when they borrow money and the rates that banks pay to their customers on deposit accounts like CDs, savings accounts, and others.In early May 2023, the Federal Reserve voted to raise the federal funds rate to 5.00%-5.25%. Then, in July 2023, the Fed again voted to raise federal funds, this time to 5.25%-5.50%.When the Fed increases the federal funds rate, rates on CDs and other banking products tend to increase too. So it would not be unusual to see further CD rate increases following this latest Federal Reserve rate hike. Meanwhile, some financial institutions, including online banks, raised their interest rates on some CD products in the aftermath of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank to try to hold on to more customers.The Fed has been raising rates over the past year to bring inflation under control. Inflation has moderated in recent months but remains above the Fed\\'s target level of 2%. While no one can predict the future, more interest rate increases might be in store. If the Fed decides to raise interest rates again, bank CD rates could continue to increase.How to avoid missing outSavers may worry about locking their money into a CD and missing out on higher interest rates down the road. And in an environment where interest rates are rising, as they have been lately, missing out on a great rate is a real possibility.CD laddering and no-penalty CDs can help you avoid the risk of missing out on higher CD rates later. Here\\\\u2019s a brief summary of these two options.No-penalty CDs: This type of CD gives you the option to withdraw funds from your account before the maturity date without paying a penalty. As a trade-off for this flexibility, however, banks tend to offer lower APYs for this type of account.CD ladder: With a CD ladder, you split your savings among multiple short-term CDs and longer-term CDs with staggered maturity dates (e.g., a 6-month CD, a 1-year CD, and a 2-year CD). When the first CD in your ladder matures, you can access those funds if you need them or roll the cash into a new CD \\\\u2014 perhaps at a higher APY if one is available at that time. Of course, no one knows the future. So there\\\\u2019s always a risk that APYs could start trending downward as well.Other details that matter when choosing a CDIf you\\\\u2019re considering CD investing, search for the best possible APY. But that isn\\\\u2019t the only detail that matters when it comes to choosing the right account.Here are some other things to consider when choosing a CD.Find the right term. Make sure you choose a CD term that fits your savings goals. That will lower the chance you\\'ll need to pull money from the account before its term ends and trigger a penalty.Look for FDIC insurance. It\\\\u2019s important to open a CD with a bank that\\\\u2019s insured by the FDIC. If you\\\\u2019re opening a share certificate, pick a state or federal credit union that\\\\u2019s insured by the NCUA. Federal deposit insurance will cover you for up to $250,000 (per depositor, per account ownership category).Check the early withdrawal penalty. You should avoid taking your money out of a CD before it matures. Read the terms carefully so you know how much you\\\\u2019d pay in an early withdrawal penalty if you have to access your cash prematurely.FAQsHow do I decide if a CD is right for me?CDs aren\\\\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for every financial situation. But they can be a solid, low-risk savings option if you\\\\u2019re seeking higher returns than traditional savings accounts may offer.If you decide to incorporate CDs into your overall savings strategy, shopping around and comparing your options is important. There are many CDs to choose from; some banks offer higher interest rates than others. Once you choose the best CD for you, consider adding some of the strategies above to supercharge your savings and reach your savings goals even faster. However, if you think you may need immediate access to your cash on a regular basis, look at high-yield savings accounts along with checking accounts \\\\u2014 those may be your best bet for now.What happens if I don\\\\u2019t withdraw the funds after the CD\\\\u2019s maturity date?When a CD matures, the bank or credit union will give you a grace period of several days after the maturity date passes. You\\'ll need to decide whether to withdraw your funds from the CD or or roll it over into a new CD, ideally one with a higher APY if possible. In most cases, if you do not withdraw your funds and the grace period passes, your bank or credit union will automatically renew the CD.Are there other savings options available instead of CDs?Although CDs are increasingly popular, they aren\\\\u2019t the only way to make your money grow. Depending on your financial situation and your goals, you may be better off with one of the following options:Traditional or online savings accountsHigh-yield savings accountsMoney market accountsWhile these savings accounts often have annual percentage yields that are a bit lower than traditional CDs offer, they all give you quick access to your money in an emergency. Accessing your savings easily can help prevent you from relying on credit cards or paying an early withdrawal penalty to access the funds tied up in a CD.Kat Tretina, Hal Bundrick, and Zina Kumok contributed to this article.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Michelle Lambright Black\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"The best CD rates for September 2023\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/the-best-cd-rates-155911888.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Fahmi Ruddin Hidayat via Getty ImagesCD rates haven\\\\u2019t been this high in years.

You should also consider term length and early withdrawal penalties in case a financial emergency comes up.Look for a bank, credit union, or neobank that offers a CD that works for you, and then evaluate other factors such as branch locations, a robust online banking app, plentiful customer service options, and easy-to-follow instructions for opening and closing a CD.The term of a CD affects the amount of interest \\\\u2014 or annual percentage yield \\\\u2014 you\\'ll be offered. APYs offered on CDs rise as terms increase from short to medium term. But longer terms don\\\\u2019t always mean the highest CD rates. In the current market, average interest rates increase between 1-month and 1-year CDs.What is a CD?A certificate of deposit, called a CD for short, is a type of savings account you can incorporate into your personal finance savings strategy. You can open a bank CD by depositing a lump sum with a traditional or online bank. Credit unions offer CDs too, called share certificates.While CDs earn compound interest similarly to deposit accounts such as savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and even some checking accounts, CDs have higher interest rates. In exchange for this more competitive, fixed APY, you must agree to leave your cash in the bank for a set period of time, called the CD\\\\u2019s term.Unlike traditional savings or checking bank accounts, the money you put into a CD isn\\\\u2019t readily available to you. If you decide to withdraw funds from a CD before its maturity date, your bank may charge you a penalty for accessing your money early. An early withdrawal penalty could offset some or all of the interest you earn on a CD. In some cases, you could even lose part of your initial deposit.Picking the right CD could come down to finding the highest APY for the term you\\\\u2019re seeking. But you should also research early withdrawal penalties in case an emergency comes up, and you need to access your money before the term ends.Pros and cons of a CD accountProsUnlike the stock market, CDs offer safe, reliable returns.CDs offer fixed interest rates with higher returns on average compared with other deposit accounts.When you open a CD at a federally insured bank or credit union, that CD is insured up to $250,000.Opening a CD may discourage you from tapping into your savings early.ConsYou\\'ll typically pay a penalty if you need your cash before a CD\\\\u2019s maturity date.The competitive rates on CDs \\\\u2014 especially longer-term CDs \\\\u2014 might not keep up with inflation.The minimum balance needed to open a CD may be too high.Although CDs are safer, they offer lower returns than mutual funds and stocks.Types of CDsIn addition to traditional certificates of deposit, there are several other types of CD to consider.Bump-up CDsWith a bump-up CD, you can request an increase in your APY if interest rates rise at your financial institution before your CD matures.

Learn about types of life insurance policies and how to get coverage. (Yurii Karvatskyi via Getty Images)Life insurance is a contract between an insurance company and a policyholder where the insurer agrees to pay a lump sum of money if the insured person dies during a covered period in exchange for premium payments. If you have people who depend on you financially, you probably need life insurance.In this article, we\\\\u2019ll cover the types of life insurance policies, the benefits of life insurance and how to get coverage. But first, to understand how life insurance works, you need to understand a few key terms.Life insurance policy: The agreement between the insurance company and the policyholder to insure someone\\\\u2019s life.Policyholder or policy owner: The person who owns the life insurance policy. Typically, this is the person whose life is insured.Death benefit: The sum of money the insurer pays out when the covered person dies.Beneficiary: The individual who receives the death benefit payout when the insured person passes. You can have a single beneficiary or multiple beneficiaries.Premiums: The monthly or annual payments the policyholder pays to keep the policy in force.Policy riders: Optional add-ons to a life insurance policy that are available for an extra cost.Types of life insurance policiesThere are two basic types of life insurance policies: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. The key difference is that term insurance only covers you for a specified period of time, whereas permanent life insurance covers you for your entire life. Also, permanent life insurance policies have a savings component called cash value, whereas term policies don\\\\u2019t.Term life insuranceA term life policy pays a death benefit only if you die within a certain period, i.e., 20 years or 30 years. If you don\\\\u2019t die during the term, the policy expires without paying out money. Term life insurance policies don\\\\u2019t accumulate cash value. However, premiums are much cheaper than permanent life insurance premiums.Whole life insuranceWhole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance. Also referred to as ordinary life insurance, these policies offer a guaranteed death benefit, plus cash value that grows at a rate guaranteed by your insurer. If you choose what\\\\u2019s called a participating policy, the insurer may also pay dividends. For all these benefits, you\\\\u2019ll pay a higher premium.Universal life insuranceUniversal life insurance is a type of permanent coverage that\\\\u2019s more flexible than whole life coverage. You can adjust the premiums (within limits) and your death benefit as your financial situation and needs change. The insurer guarantees a minimum cash value growth, but the interest you earn will vary based on money market rates.Variable life insuranceLike universal life insurance, variable life insurance offers flexible premium payments and death benefits, but you\\\\u2019re allowed to invest the policy\\\\u2019s cash value in underlying sub-accounts similar to mutual funds. Because the cash value is linked to financial market performance, variable life policies are riskier than other life insurance options.How life insurance worksWhen you apply for a policy, the life insurance company will review your medical records and often require a physical exam to determine how risky of an applicant you are. Essentially, they\\\\u2019re assessing the likelihood that you\\\\u2019ll die during the covered period. The underwriting process determines how much coverage you qualify for and how much you\\\\u2019ll pay.You\\\\u2019ll pay your premiums at regular intervals, i.e., monthly, quarterly or annually. If you miss premium payments, your policy could eventually lapse. Your premiums go toward:Insurer expenses: The portion that goes toward the insurer\\\\u2019s business expenses and profits.Cost of insurance: The amount that\\\\u2019s used to pay for death benefits.Cash value: If you have permanent life insurance (but not term insurance), part of your premium goes toward the cash value component. You can use the cash value to make partial withdrawals, take a policy loan, pay your premiums or withdraw it all and surrender the policy.Regardless of what type of policy you have, the death benefit is generally income tax-free for your beneficiaries. If you have permanent life insurance, your cash value grows on a tax-deferred basis as long as the policy is in force. You can take tax-free loans or withdrawals against the policy if the amount you take out isn\\\\u2019t more than your cost basis, i.e., what you paid in premiums.Purpose and benefits of life insuranceThe most important reason you\\\\u2019d want to buy life insurance is to avoid putting a financial burden on your loved ones when you die. Beyond that peace of mind, some specific reasons for buying life insurance include:Paying for final expenses. The median cost of a funeral with a viewing and burial was $7,848 in 2021, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Life insurance \\\\u2014 and specifically burial insurance \\\\u2014 can help your loved ones pay for these costs and other final expenses.Income replacement. Buying life insurance can help replace your income if you die, allowing those who financially depend on you to maintain their standard of living. Some people also opt for a death benefit that would cover the cost of their children\\\\u2019s education and\\\\/or college tuition.Paying off a mortgage or other debt. Obtaining a policy with a large enough benefit to pay off your mortgage and any other debt provides financial protection for your partner or spouse. If you have debt that someone else cosigned for, you might consider buying life insurance for at least that amount so they won\\\\u2019t be stuck paying it off if you die.Providing a tax-advantaged supplement to retirement savings. Buying cash value life insurance can provide a tax-deferred way to save for retirement, particularly if you\\\\u2019re already maxing out tax-deferred accounts, like a 401(k) and individual retirement account (IRA).Leave a legacy. Choosing permanent life insurance can allow you to leave a guaranteed inheritance to your loved ones or make a substantial gift to charity.Pay for estate taxes. With the federal estate tax exemption at $12.92 million in 2023, most people don\\\\u2019t need to worry about estate taxes. But some high-net-worth people use life insurance as an estate-planning tool to cover the tax bill.Determining your coverage amountThere\\\\u2019s no one-size-fits all method to determine how much life insurance coverage is sufficient, but there are a few common formulas that can help you gauge your needs. Keep in mind that these are rough estimates. Consider working with a financial professional to determine the amount of life insurance coverage and the best life insurance policy type for your unique situation.Multiple of incomeDetermine how many years you\\\\u2019d want to replace your income for, then multiply your salary by that number. If you earn $50,000 a year and want to replace your income for 20 years, you need a $1 million death benefit.Younger people will usually want to choose a higher multiple than older individuals because they have more potential future earnings. Someone who\\\\u2019s 35 may want to replace 30 years of income, while replacing 10 years of income may suffice for a 60-year-old.10 times your income plus college costsIn this formula, you multiply your income by 10, then add in the costs of higher education for your children. Many experts recommend estimating college costs at $100,000 to $150,000 per child.DIME formulaWith the DIME formula, you add up the following amounts to estimate how much life insurance you need:Debt: Your total non-mortgage debtIncome: The amount of income you want to replaceMortgage: The amount you need to pay off your mortgage in fullEducation: The expected costs of your children\\\\u2019s educationEssentially, you\\\\u2019d use the multiple of income formula, then add in your total debt (including your mortgage payoff amount) and education costs to arrive at a benefit amount.Pro tip: Even if no one relies on your income, you might still need life insurance. For example, stay-at-home parents of young children should consider buying a policy.Life insurance processThe first step in the life insurance process is to decide what type of insurance you want, along with how much coverage you\\\\u2019re seeking. Then, you can obtain a quote online or through a life insurance agent. To get an accurate life insurance quote, you\\\\u2019ll usually need to provide some basic information like your date of birth, gender, height and weight, tobacco usage, and whether you take blood pressure or cholesterol medication.Once you\\\\u2019ve chosen the policy you want, you\\\\u2019ll need to complete the application. The typical underwriting process involves a detailed health questionnaire and a medical exam. The insurer may also ask you to get what\\\\u2019s called an attending physician statement from your doctor if they need more context about any health issues.After your application is approved, you\\\\u2019ll need to review the policy documents and sign the contract. Coverage will begin shortly after you make your first premium. To avoid a lapse in coverage, you\\\\u2019ll need to continue paying the premiums.Pro tip: Some policies, known as guaranteed issue policies, approve nearly all applicants without requiring health information. But these policies have low death benefits, often $25,000 or less.Conclusion: Do you need life insurance?Not everyone needs life insurance. If you don\\\\u2019t have dependents and you have enough savings to pay for final expenses, you may not need coverage. However, if you hope to have a family someday, buying coverage while you\\\\u2019re young can help you lock in an affordable insurance rate.To determine whether you need life insurance, consider whether anyone would be financially burdened if you die. If the answer is yes, life insurance is probably well worth the cost.No one likes to think about dying. But it\\\\u2019s essential to take time to prepare for the worst to protect your loved ones\\\\u2019 well-being.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Robin Hartill, CFP\\\\u00ae\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to lower your car insurance rates (or find cheaper new coverage)\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/cheap-car-insurance-152307402.html\",\"Article Content\":\"BRO Vector via Getty ImagesEvery driver and vehicle owner needs car insurance, but no one wants to pay more than necessary for coverage.There are lots of ways to reduce your auto insurance costs.

Here are some common insurance options:Liability: Required in nearly every state, liability insurance covers property damage and bodily injury for other drivers and passengers for accidents you cause.Collision: Collision coverage can help you pay to repair or replace your personal vehicle if you\\\\u2019re in an accident.Comprehensive: Comprehensive coverage can help protect you if your vehicle is damaged in ways that don\\\\u2019t involve a collision. Theft, vandalism, and storm damage are examples of potential losses that comprehensive insurance may cover.Personal injury protection, or PIP: PIP may help provide financial coverage for your medical bills (along with your passenger\\\\u2019s medical bills) in the event of an accident.Full coverage: Full coverage is an unofficial term for a car insurance policy that includes liability insurance, collision, comprehensive, and sometimes more.You can also examine your deductible amounts and determine whether adjusting them may be in order. (Later, when you shop around and get quotes from other insurers, these details will empower you to make sure you\\\\u2019re comparing apples to apples rather than getting prices for different products and different levels of coverage.)Adjusting the types and amount of coverage you purchase can lower your car insurance costs overall. But less coverage can also leave you more exposed in the event of an accident. It\\\\u2019s important to find a middle ground as you try to cut costs to ensure you maintain the right level of protection.Tips for finding cheap car insuranceObtaining affordable car insurance isn\\\\u2019t a single step. You\\\\u2019ll probably need to combine several strategies to get the best car insurance rates possible. Here are five tips.1. Shop around and compare quotes from multiple insurers.Each insurer has its own methodology for setting premiums, using factors including your driving history, make, model and age of covered car(s), marks on your driving record such as moving violations and any other motorists who will be covered (hint: teen drivers are more expensive). Shopping around for quotes from multiple providers has the potential to reduce your auto insurance rates in a meaningful way.You might get quotes for comparable policies with annual premiums that are hundreds of dollars apart. In addition to locking in an affordable rate, you want coverage with the best car insurance company for the money, meaning one with a history of doing business in your state and a record of covering claims in a timely and fair way.2. Use online comparison tools and insurance websites.As you\\\\u2019re searching for quotes from different auto insurance companies, online comparison tools can make the shopping process easier. Some insurance websites will also provide you with quotes from competitors alongside their own rates so you can see how the premiums measure up.Online insurance comparison tools can save you time by eliminating the need to input your personal details over and over again. Plus, as you select the coverage options you desire, these tools can make sure you\\\\u2019re comparing quotes for similar policies.3. Consider direct insurers, independent agents and captive agents.There are three main avenues for buying car insurance \\\\u2014 direct insurers, independent agents and captive agents. Here\\\\u2019s what those terms mean:Direct insurers: With direct insurers, you typically buy your insurance straight from the company\\\\u2019s website or app. There\\\\u2019s no intermediary between you and the insurance provider (and no separate agent to offer you personalized advice or answers either). Examples include Geico, Esurance and Progressive.Captive agents: Captive insurance agents only sell the products their company offers and cannot provide you with quotes from competitors. Examples in the auto insurance space include Farmers, Nationwide, State Farm, and Farm Bureau.Independent agents: Independent insurance agents work with numerous providers. As a result, they can sell products from multiple insurance companies and help you shop around for the cheapest rates and hidden discounts. Yet it\\\\u2019s still important to check rates on your own since insurance agents often get paid on commission and may have financial motivation to sell you certain policies over others.4. Explore discounts and incentives offered by insurance carriers.Searching for car insurance discounts that different providers offer can be another great way to save on your premiums. There are many different discount options and incentives available. Below are some of the most common.Bundling discounts, also known as multi-policy discounts. You\\\\u2019re often rewarded with better rates when you purchase multiple policies, such as auto, life, homeowners or renters insurance, from one company.Low mileage discountsDefensive driving course discountsSafe driver discounts for maintaining good driving habitsGood student discounts for young drivers who earn good gradesMilitary discountsLoyalty discounts for staying with a company for several yearsAutopay discountsSecurity discount for installing an anti-theft devicePaid-in-full insurance premium discounts for paying your premium six months or a year at a time instead of monthlyPaperless statement discount5. Beware of potential discount insurance pitfalls.Everyone loves to save money. But certain types of discount insurance can come with pitfalls that you\\\\u2019re better off avoiding.For example, some discounted or cheap insurance policies may not cover permissive drivers (aka someone you gave permission to use your vehicle) or they might provide only reduced coverage. With other policies, your coverage level might drop when you drive outside of your state of residence.It\\\\u2019s important to read the fine print of your auto policy to understand any coverage restrictions. And check out the online reviews and complaints for different insurers you\\\\u2019re considering.Strategies to save money with your current insurerIf you don\\\\u2019t want to go through the hassle of changing auto insurance providers, you might be able to save money on your current policy.Ask for discounts: Watching your premiums increase for the same coverage gets old fast. Call your insurance agent or insurance company and ask if you\\\\u2019re eligible for any of those discounts listed above. If you\\\\u2019re considering changing insurers or you\\\\u2019ve found a lower rate with a competitor, mention that.Increase your deductibles: If you have a solid emergency fund, setting a higher deductible could lower your car insurance premiums. In return, however, you\\\\u2019d have to pay more out of pocket for accident repairs before your coverage kicks in.Adjust coverage amounts: If you have an older vehicle that\\\\u2019s paid in full, you might consider reducing your coverage or even switching to liability only. But you should go this route only if you\\\\u2019re financially able to fix your own vehicle in an accident.Factors that affect car insurance ratesWhile premiums vary among insurers, there are some common factors that affect the car insurance quotes you receive from different providers, including the following.Vehicle make and model: Certain types of cars cost more money than others to insure. As a rule, new cars and more expensive cars have higher repair costs, which will lead to higher insurance rates. If you\\\\u2019re considering buying a new or used vehicle, it\\\\u2019s wise to research the cost of insurance before you make your purchase.Age: Younger drivers typically pay more for auto insurance due to a lack of experience behind the wheel.Coverage selections and limits: The types of insurance you choose and your coverage limits have a significant impact on your car insurance rates.Credit score: Your credit-based insurance score helps predict how likely you are to file an insurance claim. Good credit has the potential to save you money on your premiums, although some states limit or don\\\\u2019t allow insurance providers to use credit when pricing auto insurance policies.Driving record: A clean driving record should save you money on your car insurance. On the other hand, if you have a history of speeding tickets, DUIs, at-fault accidents or other black marks, you should expect to pay higher premiums.Saving money by switching car insurance companiesAccording to J.D. Power, close to one-third (31%) of auto insurance customers in the U.S. have experienced a rate increase in the past year. During that same time period, auto insurance premiums have gone up an average of 15.5% to compensate for the record-high losses that insurers have experienced.Some insurers offer loyalty discounts to discourage customers from changing providers. However, it\\\\u2019s still wise to review offers from competitors at least once every 12 months to confirm you\\\\u2019re getting the best AND cheapest car insurance coverage.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Michelle Lambright Black\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Oct 2, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Understanding guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers \\\\u2014 and what to know before becoming one\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/guarantor-cosigner-vs-coborrower-172936653.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Financing a large purchase with a personal loan can be a great way to build wealth without dinging your budget upfront. The catch? Most lenders rely heavily on your credit history to tell them if you\\\\u2019re a trustworthy borrower.In these cases, if your credit score needs some TLC, you might need someone to vouch for you who has good credit so your lender will feel more comfortable doing business with you.Guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers explainedIf you\\\\u2019re contemplating applying for a new personal loan, understanding your credit score and how your lender might view it is key.Your credit score gives your lender a better understanding of your financial habits regarding credit usage and repayment. The major credit bureaus take factors like your payment history, length of credit history, amount owed, credit mix, and new credit into account when calculating your final score.You might need some backup if your credit isn\\\\u2019t up to your lender\\\\u2019s standards.What is a guarantor?A guarantor is someone who guarantees a loan like a mortgage, student loan, or auto loan \\\\u2014 meaning that they agree to repay that loan if the borrower fails to make monthly payments on their loan.Essentially, a guarantor\\\\u2019s job is to reassure your lender that they will be repaid. And if the borrower fails to make a loan payment, they\\\\u2019ll make those payments on the borrower\\\\u2019s behalf. In many cases, a borrower might lean on a guarantor if they have a bad credit score, no credit history, or earn a lower income.Anyone over age 21 can be a guarantor with a healthy credit history. Usually, a guarantor is someone the borrower has a close relationship with like a parent, sibling, or close friend.What is a co-signer?A co-signer is like a guarantor, with the main difference being that a co-signer is liable for a borrower\\\\u2019s debt from day one, while a guarantor is only liable once the borrower fails to make payments.Being a co-signer for a friend or loved one can help increase their chances of loan approval, but it does imply a significant risk if they don\\\\u2019t hold up their end of the bargain. Failure to repay their loan could significantly damage your credit score and hurt your chances of qualifying for a new loan or credit card in the future.What is a co-borrower?A co-borrower is a co-applicant, who shares equal responsibility for the loan along with the borrower or borrowers involved.Having a co-borrower can make a lot of sense if you both stand to benefit from the asset that\\\\u2019s being financed. Say you\\\\u2019re hoping to open a business, you might consider applying for a loan with your business partner who will also profit from the revenue your business earns.The upside of having a co-borrower is having someone to share the debt burden and repayment with. What\\\\u2019s more \\\\u2014 if your co-borrower has a higher credit score or lower debt-to-income ratio (DTI), you may be able to qualify for a larger loan or one with more favorable terms.What to consider before agreeing to be someone\\\\u2019s guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrowerBefore you agree to be someone\\\\u2019s guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower, there are several factors you should carefully consider to determine if it\\\\u2019s the right move for you.The state of your personal financesSharing any portion of someone\\\\u2019s debt or repayment is a huge responsibility. If your personal finances aren\\\\u2019t in tip-top shape, you could risk damaging your credit score and hindering your chances of borrowing in the future.Consider how much debt you currently have, if any, and whether or not you\\\\u2019d be able to fit an additional debt payment into your budget if the borrower fails to make payments.The terms and conditions of the loanBefore you sign on the dotted line, you should be clear on the terms and conditions of your loan. Have a candid conversation with the primary or co-borrower to understand what the loan is for, the total loan amount borrowed, interest rates associated with the loan, and the repayment schedule and timeline.You should also ask clear questions about your legal responsibility and understand in which scenarios you\\\\u2019d be responsible for making payments and when.Your relationship with the borrowerUltimately, taking any level of ownership of someone else\\\\u2019s debt is an act of trust, so you should only do so if you have full and complete trust that they will manage their debt responsibly and make on-time payments.It\\\\u2019s also important to consider how sharing this debt will affect your relationship should they default on their loan.Be sure to discuss a clear loan repayment plan and explore all possible outcomes to determine whether or not you feel comfortable taking on this new responsibility.Your near-term financial goalsServing as someone\\\\u2019s guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower may impact your ability to hit some of your own financial goals. It\\\\u2019ll increase your DTI and could make qualifying for a new loan more difficult in the future.If your financial plans include buying a home, taking out a student loan to go back to school, financing a vehicle, or other financial milestones that require the help of a lender, it may not be the time to involve yourself in someone else\\\\u2019s debt. This move will be reflected on your credit report and too many new credit applications in a short time could lead to a rejection and a drop in your credit score.It can certainly be rewarding to help a loved one achieve their goals, but understanding the pros and cons can help you make a more informed decision.FAQs about being a guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrowerCan a family member be a co-borrower?Yes. Anyone who meets the eligibility requirements set by your lender can be a co-borrower. This includes parents, siblings, a spouse, a business partner, friends, and more.Is a co-borrower also a co-owner?Not always. A co-borrower shares financial responsibility for an asset, but may not always share ownership of the asset. Depending on your arrangement, the type of loan, and the ownership agreement in place, a co-borrower may also be a co-owner, but this isn\\\\u2019t always the case.What happens if I am a guarantor on someone\\\\u2019s loan and they stop making payments?If the primary borrower fails to make a payment on their loan, their lender will take steps to contact them and remind them about their missed payment. After a series of missed payments, the loan will enter into default, at which time the lender may contact you (the guarantor) to collect missed payments and get the loan back into good standing. If both you and the borrower fail to make payments on the loan, the lender could take legal action as a result and you\\\\u2019ll likely see a decrease in your credit score.Are guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers legally protected if the primary borrower defaults on their loan?In most cases, guarantors and co-signers have limited legal protections if a borrower defaults on their loan. Lenders outline the terms of the loan agreement and guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers are legally responsible for the loan amount. Before signing any loan agreement, it may be worth your while to speak with a legal expert who can help you understand the terms of your agreement.Can you remove a guarantor from your loan?Over time, you may be able to remove a guarantor from your loan if you can prove to your lender that you\\\\u2019ll be able to make payments on your loan without their support. You may need to refinance your loan by applying for a new loan on your own and, if approved, using those loan funds to repay your existing loan \\\\u2014 thus, freeing your guarantor from their obligation.You may even be able to secure a lower interest rate on your loan, depending on your credit and income.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ivana Pino\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 29, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Here\\\\u2019s how a DUI impacts your car insurance\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/car-insurance-after-dui-163728985.html\",\"Article Content\":\"nurlankani via Getty ImagesDrivers in nearly every state are required to obtain minimum car insurance coverage, including those with past violations for driving under the influence (DUI), driving while intoxicated (DWI), or operating under the influence (OUI). But with these charges on your record, car insurance companies will generally view you as a higher risk to insure, which can mean unexpected policy cancellations and increased insurance rates.Despite this, you\\\\u2019ll still need coverage to meet your state\\\\u2019s insurance requirements.Here\\\\u2019s what to know about car insurance after a DUI, how your rates will change, and tips for lowering your insurance costs.What happens after a DUI?If you\\'re pulled over and arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, the arresting officer will probably confiscate your driver\\'s license. You may receive a temporary license once you\\'re released from custody, which you can use until you\\'re arraigned in court.Whether you want to hire a lawyer for your court hearing depends on your individual preferences and driving history. For instance, it may be wise to hire a lawyer if you have a past DUI or to help you resolve the case on a reduced charge.If you\\\\u2019re found guilty of driving under the influence, your license will likely be revoked for at least 90 days, though it could be longer depending on your state\\\\u2019s rules and if it\\\\u2019s your first offense. Your DUI conviction will also appear on your driving record, and your auto insurance company might drop your coverage.If not, expect a rate hike.How a DUI impacts your car insurance ratesIf your insurance company allows you to maintain your policy after a DUI or DWI conviction, you can expect a sharp increase in your auto insurance rates. A 2023 study from auto insurance comparison site QwoteWizard estimates that car insurance premiums increase by an average of $1,495 annually, or $124 monthly, after a DUI. The study is based on data from Quadrant Information Services, which collects rate and pricing data from insurance providers nationwide.But the amount your rate increases can vary by state. According to the QwoteWizard study, drivers in Hawaii, California, and North Carolina saw the biggest increases after a DUI. For instance, California drivers paid an average of $157 per month with a clean record and around $433 monthly after a DUI.If you have other infractions besides a DUI, such as an at-fault accident or speeding ticket, these will also result in higher car insurance costs. Depending on your state and driving history, your DUI may remain on your record for three to 10 years, while other infractions typically remain for up to five years or longer in states like Minnesota and Hawaii.While insurance companies often hike rates for a minimum of three years after a driving infraction, the amount of time your rates will remain high varies based on your insurer, driving record, and infraction you\\\\u2019ve committed.SR-22 and FR-44 requirementsCertain states, such as California and Washington, will require that your insurer files an SR-22 form with the state to prove you consistently meet minimum coverage requirements after a DUI. In Virginia and Florida, you\\\\u2019ll need to file an FR-44 instead of an SR-22 if you have a DUI conviction. Some states, like New York, don\\\\u2019t require you to file an SR-22 or FR-44, though you can still expect higher insurance rates for serious driving violations.Typically, an FR-44 or SR-22 filing will need to be in place for at least three years following a DUI conviction, though requirements vary by state. Once you\\\\u2019ve met your state\\\\u2019s requirements, you can request that your insurance company remove the form from your record.How to get coverage after a DUIMaintaining adequate insurance will be fairly simple \\\\u2014 though expensive \\\\u2014 if your insurance provider offers policies for drivers with past DUIs. You can request that your insurer file any required forms with your state. But expect your regular monthly car insurance premiums to increase due to the conviction.Things get a little more complicated if your insurer cancels your policy because of a DUI conviction. You\\'ll need to find a provider willing to issue car insurance policies to high-risk drivers \\\\u2014 and you\\\\u2019ll need to do so quickly to avoid a lapse in coverage, which could result in even higher rates. It can be helpful to contact your state\\'s department or bureau of motor vehicles for guidance on obtaining DUI car insurance.Remember that most states require at least a minimum amount of car insurance coverage, often including two types of liability insurance. Note that insurance requirements can vary by state.Bodily injury liability: Covers medical costs for individuals in other vehicles if you\\\\u2019re at fault in a car accident.Property damage liability: Pays for repairs to damaged property if you\\'re found responsible for an accident.If your car is leased or financed, your lender may require you to obtain more coverage. Here are some other coverage options.Comprehensive coverage: Pays for car repairs if your vehicle is damaged due to a covered event, such as severe weather, a fire, burglary, or another event outside your control.Collision coverage: Pays for car repairs if your vehicle is damaged in an accident with another car.Underinsured\\\\/uninsured motorist: Protects you if you\\\\u2019re in a crash with another driver who doesn\\\\u2019t have adequate car insurance coverage.Personal injury protection: Also called no-fault insurance, personal injury protection (PIP) covers your healthcare expenses if you\\\\u2019re injured in an accident, no matter who\\\\u2019s responsible.Tips for finding cheap car insurance for high-risk driversOnce you have a list of potential insurers that issue policies to high-risk drivers and you understand your insurance requirements and needs, it\\\\u2019s time to find coverage. While your cost of car insurance will be higher with a DUI, rates vary across companies. Here are some tips for finding relatively affordable coverage.1. Use rate comparison toolsOnline insurance calculators and rate comparison tools let you view quotes from multiple insurance companies in one place. These tools can help save you time as you shop for a new policy as a high-risk driver.2. Get multiple quotesIf you prefer to seek out car insurance quotes on your own, you can also go that route. Many major insurers, including Progressive, State Farm, GEICO, Allstate, USAA, The General and Erie all write high-risk policies. You can start an application online or speak with insurance agents to obtain quotes and compare rates.3. Seek out discountsMany insurers offer discounts, which may be accessible despite your DUI. For instance, bundling multiple policies like your homeowners and auto insurance with the same provider could help you save on your premiums. Other common ones include safe vehicle, good grades, low-mileage discounts and good driver discounts. Yahoo Personal FinanceHow to minimize the long-term impact of a DUI on insurance ratesA DUI conviction will generally stay on your driving record for five to 10 years, though the time frame depends on your state. But there are things you can do to reduce the time you must face rate increases.1. Maintain a clean driving recordMaintaining a squeaky-clean driving record is the best thing you can do to help reduce your rates over time.2. Take a defensive driving courseMany insurance companies offer safe driving discounts if you complete a defensive driving course.3. Improve your credit scoreYour credit history is sometimes used as a factor in setting individual insurance rates. The lowest rates are often reserved for individuals with excellent credit or good credit because they\\\\u2019re deemed as less risky to insure. Note that some states prohibit the use of credit as a rating factor.4.

Not only are you letting the driver take your high-value item around town, your car insurance policy comes into play too. Under the concept of \\\\u201cpermissive use,\\\\u201d if you give permission for a valid driver to borrow your vehicle, your policy still covers your car.But there are some key nuances.If someone else drives and wrecks your car, but they are not at fault, the other driver\\\\u2019s liability coverage will cover the property damage and bodily injury. If the at-fault driver doesn\\\\u2019t have enough coverage, your policy\\\\u2019s uninsured\\\\/underinsured motorist protection may be necessary to cover the difference.If you lend your car to someone who is at-fault in an accident, though, your own auto insurance coverage will apply. Any resulting property damage or injuries will be covered by your insurance company, up to your policy\\\\u2019s coverage limits.It\\\\u2019s important to read the fine print of your policy documents, to ensure that you understand your carrier\\\\u2019s permissive use policies and exactly what they cover.Who pays the deductible?If you have collision coverage on your vehicle, in the event a friend or family member wrecks your car, it will pay to repair or replace your vehicle. If you\\\\u2019re the at-fault party, you will still be responsible for paying any applicable deductible for the repairs, though.So, who actually pays the deductible, if you weren\\\\u2019t technically driving your car in the first place? Well, this is where things get a bit gray.In most cases, you and your friend will need to talk to decide who pays. If your friend refuses, or can\\\\u2019t afford the deductible, you may have to foot the bill in order to get your car repaired. Your carrier may choose to go after your friend\\\\u2019s auto insurance policy for costs that exceed your policy limits, but they don\\\\u2019t typically recover your deductible for you.Read more: What you need to know about car insurance deductiblesWhat if you don\\\\u2019t have enough coverage?If your liability from an at-fault accident exceeds your policy limits \\\\u2014 even if a friend was driving \\\\u2014 you may find yourself in a sticky situation.First, the borrower\\\\u2019s own insurance coverage may be tapped to provide secondary coverage, depending on your state and the specifics of the accident. If you have an umbrella policy or other personal liability policy, that coverage may also be utilized to cover the not-at-fault driver\\\\u2019s damages.If your coverage still isn\\\\u2019t enough, you could be personally liable for the expenses beyond your policy limits.Will your insurance cover someone not on your policy?If you let a loved one borrow your car and that person gets into an accident, your carrier will usually cover the loss even if that individual wasn\\\\u2019t on your policy. There are a few exceptions, though:If there wasn\\\\u2019t permissive use: Your carrier may deny insurance claims for a car accident if someone borrowed your vehicle without your explicit permission, i.e., non-permissive use.If the driver wasn\\\\u2019t legally licensed or was impaired: As the owner of the vehicle, it\\\\u2019s your responsibility not to lend it to someone without a valid driver\\\\u2019s license, whose license is suspended, or someone who is obviously impaired. If you do lend your vehicle to a reckless or illegal driver, your carrier may deny a resulting claim. So it may seem obvious, but you should think twice about handing your keys to anyone with a history of speeding tickets, drunk driving, DUIs or other black marks on their driving record.If the driver was listed as a named exclusion \\\\u2014 You can list people on your policy as excluded drivers, meaning you are explicitly excluding them from your coverage. If an excluded driver uses your vehicle and gets in an accident, your carrier will not extend coverage.If someone will be borrowing your vehicle regularly, you may want to add them as an authorized driver to your policy. This will ensure that they are always protected when using your car, and you never have to worry about whether or not coverage is provided.What happens if you wreck a borrowed car?In general, car insurance follows the car, not the driver. So, as long as you borrowed a car that has active and valid insurance coverage, you should be protected if you get in an accident. In most situations, primary coverage would be the policy of the car owner, not the driver.If you\\\\u2019re at fault for wrecking a borrowed car, the vehicle owner\\\\u2019s insurance should provide liability coverage to the not-at-fault driver and also pay to fix the borrowed vehicle if collision insurance was added.If you aren\\\\u2019t at fault for a wreck in a borrowed vehicle, the at-fault driver\\\\u2019s liability coverage should cover your injuries and any damage to the car you were driving.When would your own insurance company have to pay?If you get into an auto accident in a borrowed car, there is a chance that your own auto insurance policy may be required to provide secondary coverage if you\\\\u2019re found at-fault.This typically only occurs if the vehicle owner doesn\\\\u2019t have sufficient coverage. In this case, your own coverage may be called on to cover damages that exceed the owner\\\\u2019s policy limits.If you\\\\u2019re injured in the accident, your policy can also provide you with personal injury protection (PIP) and medical payments (Medpay) coverage in some cases, even if you\\\\u2019re driving a borrowed car. Yahoo Personal FinanceHow often do you borrow others\\\\u2019 cars?Vehicle owners are allowed to lend out their car on occasion without penalty, as long as the driver they\\\\u2019re handing the keys to has a valid license and there\\\\u2019s no reason to believe they will be reckless. But such permissive use coverage is intended for occasional drivers.If you regularly borrow a car from someone \\\\u2014 such as sharing a family vehicle or driving your partner\\\\u2019s car on a daily basis \\\\u2014 you may need to be added to their policy as an authorized driver.Many carriers will require policyholders to add other drivers who live in the home, adult children or acquaintances who frequently drive the vehicle. If you wreck a borrowed vehicle and it\\\\u2019s discovered that you borrow that car all the time but are not added to the policy, the insurance carrier could potentially push back on the claim.Consider your own policyIf you don\\\\u2019t own your own car, you may think you don\\\\u2019t need insurance coverage. However, if you regularly drive other people\\\\u2019s vehicles, you should seriously consider buying a non-owner auto insurance policy.Non-owner car insurance provides you with liability coverage anytime you get behind the wheel of someone else\\\\u2019s car. It doesn\\\\u2019t include comprehensive or collision coverage \\\\u2014 so any vehicle you borrow wouldn\\\\u2019t be covered by this policy \\\\u2014 but is typically more affordable than a standard policy.Depending on the carrier, you may also be able to add PIP, Medpay, and\\\\/or uninsured\\\\/underinsured motorist coverage to protect you if you\\\\u2019re injured in an accident.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Stephanie Colestock\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 28, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is a good student loan interest rate?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/student-loan-interest-rates-152429559.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Student loan interest rates are an annualized representation of the cost of borrowing for your college education.

Note that these laws do not affect private student loan interest rates.Loan type: The Department of Education has three different loan programs, each with a different interest rate for each one. With private student loans, interest rates can vary depending on the lender and the type of interest rate you choose.Interest rate type: While federal student loans all have fixed interest rates, private lenders offer both fixed and variable rates. Variable interest rates usually start out lower than fixed rates \\\\u2014 though they can be higher if market rates are currently high \\\\u2014 and they can fluctuate over time based on a benchmark index.Creditworthiness: If you\\'re applying for private student loans, your interest rate will also depend on your credit history, other debt, income, and other factors.The role of loan type and lenderFederal student loans come with standardized interest rates for each program. If you apply for undergraduate loans, for instance, you\\'ll receive the same interest rate as everyone else who applies for undergraduate loans in the same year.Because federal student loan interest rates are fixed, you don\\'t have to worry about your rate \\\\u2014 and, therefore, your monthly payment \\\\u2014 to change. They also tend to be lower than private student loans on average because they\\'re a form of financial aid.In contrast, private student loan companies set their own interest rates and often provide a range based on creditworthiness. For example, the best student loans may come with an annual percentage rate (APR) ranging from 4.5% to 17%. Because private lenders also typically offer both fixed and variable rates, you may have the choice between the two.The impact of credit score and co-signersMost federal student loan programs don\\'t require a credit check when you apply, and you don\\'t need a co-signer to get approved. If you\\'re a graduate or professional student or a parent, you\\'ll typically undergo a credit check, but only to ensure that you don\\'t have any major negative items on your credit reports.But if you qualify, you\\'ll get the same interest rate as everyone else.With private student loans, your credit score is an important factor in determining your interest rate. Lenders typically require a minimum credit score in the mid-600s, though a score in the mid-700s or higher will give you a better chance of securing a low rate.If you can\\'t get approved for a low interest rate, you can improve your odds by applying with a creditworthy co-signer. Because a co-signer agrees to pay back the debt if you can\\'t, the lender will use their credit score, income and other factors during the underwriting process, which can help you save money.Average interest rates for different types of loansInterest rates constantly change, so it\\'s important to check up-to-date information before applying. With that said, here are the federal student loan interest rates for the 2023-24 school year:Direct undergraduate loans: 5.50%Direct graduate and professional loans: 7.05%Direct PLUS loans: 8.05%As of August 2023, the average fixed rate among the top private lenders is 9.62% for undergraduate loans and 9.51% for graduate loans.And remember, while variable interest rates can start out lower than fixed rates, you\\'re taking a risk that rates will increase in the future, making your loans more expensive than a fixed-rate private student loan.Factors behind high interest ratesBecause federal student loan interest rates are standardized, increasing rates on federal loans are generally due to changes in economic conditions that result in a higher 10-year Treasury bill rate. Inflation and monetary policies by the Federal Reserve are among the biggest drivers of high Treasury rates.Private lenders also typically increase their interest rates in response to the Federal Reserve\\'s monetary policies. When the inflation rate is high, the Fed raises its federal funds rate to increase the cost of borrowing \\\\u2014 the goal is to reduce consumer spending, which can help bring down the inflation rate.The federal funds rate directly influences the prime rate, which lenders often use as a benchmark for their own interest rates. Within the range a private lender provides, yours may be high if the lender considers you to be a risky borrower \\\\u2014 for example, a low credit score or income may increase the chances of default.What\\'s a good interest rate?Because interest rates on student loans are constantly changing, it\\'s important to check current rates to get an idea of what you should shoot for. Because federal student loan interest rates are generally low and standardized, so they\\'re a good benchmark.If you\\'re applying for private student loans, rates can range from roughly 4.5% to 17%, depending on the lender. You\\'ll want to try to secure an interest rate on the low end of that spectrum.Comparison to other loan typesStudent loans are a form of unsecured credit, meaning you don\\'t need to put up collateral to get approved. Other loan types, such as mortgage and auto loans, may offer lower interest rates because they\\'re secured by collateral. But depending on economic conditions, federal student loan rates can be lower.But other types of unsecured loans, including personal loans and credit cards, typically charge higher interest rates. Here\\'s a quick comparison of average rates as of September 2023:Understanding the impact of interest rates on loan costYour student loan interest has a direct impact on your overall loan cost. Because student loans can have repayment terms as long as 30 years, even a small change in your rate can make a big difference.For example, let\\'s say you have $30,000 in student loans with a 10-year repayment term and a 5% interest rate. Your monthly payment would be $318.20, and you\\'d pay roughly $8,183 in interest. If we change the rate to 5.5%, your monthly payment would only increase by roughly $7, which translates to approximately $900 more in interest.As a result, it\\'s crucial that you research and compare all of your options to ensure you get the best student loan interest rate possible.Tips for securing favorable student loan interest ratesWhether you\\'re a college student or a parent, here are some steps you can take to ensure you get the lowest student loan interest rate:Generally, stick to federal loans: If you\\'re a college student, you\\'re more likely to get a low rate through a federal student loan than to try your luck with private lenders. Even if you\\'re a parent, federal student loans can have competitive rates, as well as generous relief options if you struggle with repayment.Shop around: If you\\'ve exceeded your allotment of federal student loans, take your time to shop around and compare interest rates from multiple private lenders to get an idea of which one will offer you the best deal.Improve your credit: The higher your credit score, the better your odds of getting approved for a low interest rate on a private student loan.Find a co-signer: If you\\'re struggling to get a low private loan interest rate on your own, consider asking a parent or other loved one with good credit to apply with you as a co-signer.Improving credit score and co-signer strategyIf you\\'re a graduate school student or a parent and considering private student loans, it\\'s important to prepare your credit before you apply. Here are some steps you can take:Always pay your bills on time and get caught up on past-due payments.Check your credit score to gauge your overall credit health.Review your credit reports for specific issues you can address.Pay down credit card balances.Pay off small-balance loans.Ask a family member or friend with good credit to add you as an authorized user on their credit card account.If you need a co-signer, it\\'s best to ask a family member who has good credit. If that doesn\\'t work, consider a close friend or a mentor. Just keep in mind that co-signing a student loan application makes that person responsible for payments if you fail to, so it\\'s important to make sure they understand the implications before agreeing.Addressing high interest ratesIf you have student loans with high interest rates, you may have some options available to you to limit your costs.If you have federal student loans, there\\'s no program offered by the Department of Education that can reduce your interest rate. In fact, the direct loan consolidation program, which you can use to combine multiple loans into one, typically results in a slightly higher weighted-average rate compared to the loans you want to consolidate.However, you may consider some options:Setting up autopay: Whether you have federal or private student loans, you can typically get a 0.25% discount on your interest rate by setting up automatic payments.Getting on an income-driven repayment plan: If you have federal student loans, an income-driven repayment plan won\\'t reduce your interest rate. But it can reduce your monthly payment to make it more manageable, and it can even open up opportunities for forgiveness down the road.Refinancing: Depending on your credit score and income, you may qualify for a lower rate than what you\\'re currently paying with a student loan refinance. You can even add a co-signer to improve your chances.Refinancing may be a no-brainer if you have private student loans and can save money with a refinance loan. But if you have federal loans, keep in mind that you\\'ll lose access to certain benefits, including access to student loan forgiveness programs, income-driven repayment plans and generous forbearance and deferment options.Before you decide to refinance federal student loans with a private lender, think carefully about your job and income stability, as well as your eligibility for forgiveness, to determine if it\\'s the right decision for you.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 28, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Student Loan 101: Are Federal or Private Loans Better?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/are-federal-or-private-loans-better-175200294.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Aleksei Naumov via Getty ImagesIf you need to borrow money to pay for college, you\\'re not alone. The College Board reported that 54% of bachelor\\'s degree recipients from public and private nonprofit universities graduate with student loan debt.The two main types of student loans are federal loans and private loans. Which type of student loan you use can impact your repayment options and overall cost.Are federal or private loans better? The answer to that question depends on your program, finances, and eligibility for financial aid.What are federal student loans?Federal student loans are a type of student loan where the U.S. Department of Education acts as the lender. They make up the vast majority of outstanding loans. In fact, federal loans make up 92.78% of the $1.76 trillion national student loan debt.Financial experts and organizations like the National Association of Financial Aid Administrators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and The Institute for College Access & Success all stressed exhausting all federal financial aid \\\\u2014 including federal student loans \\\\u2014 before turning to private loans. Why? They usually have lower rates than private loans, and the government provides more borrower protections and repayment options than private lenders.For students and their parents, there are four different types of student loans available from the federal government:Direct Subsidized: These loans are for undergraduate students only. Students must have significant financial needs. The government waives the interest that accrues while the student is in school, during the loan grace period and any periods of deferment.Direct Unsubsidized: Direct Unsubsidized can be used for undergraduate or graduate programs; loans used for graduate school will have higher rates. The student is responsible for all interest that accrues.Grad PLUS: Graduate and professional students can use Grad PLUS Loans to borrow up to the total cost of attendance of their program.Parent PLUS: Parents can borrow money to pay for their biological or adopted child\\'s undergraduate education.All federal loans have fixed interest rates, and all borrowers \\\\u2014 regardless of credit or income \\\\u2014 qualify for the same rate for that type of loan. The default repayment term for all federal student loans is 10 years.What is a private student loan?Private loans make up a small part \\\\u2014 just 7% \\\\u2014 of the overall student loan market. Whereas the federal government issues federal loans, private student loans can come from banks, credit unions and other financial institutions.Although federal loans have fixed rates, private student loans can have fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically have lower initial rates than fixed-rate loans, but the rates can change over time. And repayment terms can range from five to 15 years.Students can use private student loans to pay for undergraduate or graduate programs. However, private loans are credit-based, meaning lenders have strict borrower requirements, and not everyone will qualify for a loan.Private loan eligibilityAlthough requirements vary by lender, private lenders generally require borrowers to have good to excellent credit \\\\u2014 meaning a FICO credit score of 670 or better \\\\u2014 and meet certain income requirements.Since college students may not have good credit (or any credit history at all) and are unlikely to have a substantial source of income, most students will need a parent or relative to co-sign the loan with them. By co-signing the loan, the relative shares responsibility for the loan\\'s repayment. If the primary borrower falls behind, the co-signer has to make payments in their place.6 key differences between federal and private loansWhen considering which types of student loans to use, consider these six essential differences:1. Annual and lifetime borrowing limitsAnnual and lifetime borrowing limits are very different between federal and private student loans, with private loans having higher maximums.The federal government established caps on Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized student loans. Depending on your dependency status and the year of college you\\'re entering, the annual maximum ranges from $3,500 to $12,500 for undergraduate students and up to $20,500 for graduate students.An aggregate or lifetime maximum also applies. It ranges from $31,000 to $57,500 for undergraduate students, and $138,500 for graduate students (that number includes all federal student loans you used for undergraduate study too).With private loans, lenders rarely have a fixed maximum; instead, they allow students and parents to borrow up to the total cost of attendance for their program. Because their lending maximums aren\\'t as restrictive as federal loans, they are a useful option for borrowers that have reached the annual or lifetime borrowing limits and need additional cash to pay for school.2. Credit and income criteriaFederal loans are typically easier to qualify for than federal loans. Federal student loans have no minimum income requirements, and Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized don\\'t involve credit checks.Applicants for federal PLUS Loans will undergo a credit check, but the credit inquiry is less intensive. Rather than looking for a specific FICO score or better, the government reviews your credit report to see if you have an adverse credit history, meaning recent major credit issues like foreclosure, vehicle repossession or collections.Requirements for private loans are more strict. Borrowers usually need to have established credit histories and FICO scores of 670 or better and meet income minimums. If they don\\'t meet the lender\\'s requirements, the only way to qualify for a loan is to add a co-signer to their application.3. Interest rates and type of interestFederal loans always have fixed rates, and the rates for undergraduate loans tend to be low. They also have disbursement fees deducted from the loan when it is issued to you. These are the rates and fees for federal loans issued between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024:Private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates, and they rarely have origination or disbursement fees. Rates vary by lender and whether the loan is used for undergraduate or graduate programs. As of July 2023, rates ranged from 4.44% to 18.00% for variable-rate loans, and fixed-rate loans ranged from 4.42% to 18.00%. Out of the 10 lenders we evaluated, none charged disbursement fees.Important: Grad and Parent PLUS Loans have the highest interest rate ever since the Direct Loan program was launched. Borrowers with excellent credit may qualify for private graduate or parent loans with lower rates, but keep in mind that private loans lack some of the benefits and protections of federal loans.4. In-school payment plansFederal student loans tend to be more generous in terms of in-school repayment than private lenders. Students do not have to make payments while they\\'re in school or during their grace periods, a period of six months after they graduate or leave college.With private student loans, you may have to make payments while you\\'re in college. Private lenders typically have several in-school repayment options. Depending on the lender, you may be able to choose from the following plans:Immediate: As soon as the loan is disbursed, you begin making full principal and interest payments each month.Interest-only: After the loan is issued, you make monthly payments to cover the accrued interest while you\\'re in school. Once you graduate, the payments increase, so you also pay toward the principal.Fixed: With a fixed payment plan, you pay a specific amount, such as $25 per month, while in college. Once you graduate, the payments increase to cover the principal and interest.Deferred: If you opt for deferred repayment, you don\\'t have to make any payments until after you graduate. Because interest accrues during your time in school, the deferred payment plan has the highest overall repayment cost.5. Repayment and hardship options after graduationWhere federal student loans stand out is in borrower protection. Depending on your situation, you may qualify for the following options:If you\\'re ill or unemployed: If you become seriously ill or lose your job, you may be eligible for a federal deferment program. With these programs, you can postpone your payments for several months at a time.If you return to school: If you decide to return to school to earn another degree, you can defer your federal student loan payments until after you graduate from the new program or leave school.If your payment is too high: If you cannot afford the monthly payments under a standard 10-year repayment plan, you may be eligible for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. The payments are based on a percentage of your discretionary income, and some borrowers qualify for payments as low as $0.6. Loan forgiveness eligibilityFederal student loans are often eligible for loan forgiveness programs. For example:Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Borrowers may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and get up to 100% of their outstanding loans forgiven after meeting the program\\'s eligibility requirements. They must work for an eligible non-profit organization or government office full-time for at least 10 years and make 120 qualifying monthly payments.Teacher Loan Forgiveness: Teachers that teach high-need subjects in low-income schools or education service agencies for at least five years can qualify for up to $17,500 of loan forgiveness.Income-Driven Repayment Discharge: If you sign up for an IDR plan and still have outstanding federal loans at the end of your loan term, the government will discharge the remainder.Private student loans aren\\'t eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs like PSLF or Teacher Loan Forgiveness. But they may qualify for state loan repayment programs based on your employment or for employer repayment assistance.Are federal or private loans better?Federal student loans are the better starting point for most borrowers, but private student loans can fulfill a need if you reach the annual or aggregate borrowing limits, or don\\'t qualify for federal student loans. Taking out a private loan could allow you to complete your program and earn the degree you otherwise wouldn\\'t be able to finance.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kat Tretina\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 28, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How does uninsured motorist coverage work?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/how-does-uninsured-motorist-coverage-work-213348857.html\",\"Article Content\":\"sabelskaya via Getty ImagesLiability auto insurance is a requirement in most states, but approximately 1 in 8 drivers don\\\\u2019t have insurance, according to the Insurance Research Council. If you get into an accident with an uninsured driver, you could be on the hook for paying thousands in medical bills or car repair costs.Having an auto policy that includes uninsured motorist coverage can help you avoid a bunch of out-of-pocket costs if a driver without insurance crashes into you.What is uninsured motorist coverage?Uninsured motorist coverage, or UM coverage, is insurance that protects you, your passengers, and your vehicle if you are the victim in an accident caused by a driver without car insurance.While about 13% of drivers nationwide are uninsured, the proportion in individual states varies. According to the Insurance Research Council\\\\u2019s most recent study, New Jersey has the lowest percentage of uninsured drivers with an estimated 3%. Mississippi, on the other hand, has the highest percentage of uninsured drivers at just over 29%.To offset the risk posed by uninsured motorists, several states have laws requiring drivers to maintain some type of uninsured motorist insurance. These states are:ConnecticutWashington, D.C.IllinoisMaineMarylandMinnesotaNebraskaNew JerseyNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOregonSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaVermontVirginiaWest VirginiaWisconsinTypes of uninsured motorist insuranceThere are two types: uninsured motorist bodily injury (UMBI) coverage and uninsured motorist property damage (UMPD) coverage.Uninsured motorist bodily injury coverageUninsured motorist bodily injury coverage helps cover medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and potentially funeral expenses after you\\\\u2019re in an auto accident with an uninsured motorist.Typically, if you\\\\u2019re in a car accident, the insurance company of the driver who is at fault would cover the expenses that arise (unless you\\\\u2019re in a no-fault state). If the at-fault driver doesn\\\\u2019t have insurance and can\\\\u2019t cover the expenses on their own, you could be facing thousands of dollars worth of medical bills, lost wages, long-term care, and other expenses.In some states, uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage can be used by victims of a hit-and-run accident. This type of coverage can even protect pedestrians who are hit by vehicles driven by uninsured motorists.Although adding uninsured motorist coverage to your policy will increase your premium, it\\\\u2019s usually a fairly nominal amount. You typically won\\\\u2019t have to pay a deductible before this coverage kicks in.It\\\\u2019s recommended that you choose policy limits for uninsured motorist coverage similar to your liability coverage limits. For example, if your liability limits are set at $25,000 per individual and $50,000 per accident, you should opt for $25,000\\\\/$50,000 limits for your UM coverage as well.Some states will allow what\\\\u2019s known as \\\\\"stacking\\\\\" when you have multiple vehicles on your auto insurance policy. Stacking lets you multiply your coverage limits by the number of cars on your policy. For instance, if your limits were 25\\\\/50 and you had three cars on your policy, you could stack that coverage so that you could get up to $75,000 per person and $150,000 per accident.Uninsured motorist property damage coverageUninsured motorist property damage coverage helps you pay for damage to your vehicle or other property (such as a fence or house) following an accident caused by an uninsured driver.It may also be used for other related expenses, such as covering your collision coverage deductible or the cost of a rental car while your vehicle\\\\u2019s being repaired.By selecting coverage limits that match up with the value of your vehicle, you can avoid taking a financial loss if your vehicle is totaled.Uninsured motorist property damage coverage isn\\\\u2019t available in every state and may require a deductible.What is an underinsured driver?Similar to uninsured motorist coverage, auto coverage known as underinsured motorist (UIM) insurance can be included on your car insurance policy to cover injury or loss stemming from an accident with a driver who doesn\\\\u2019t have enough insurance.A driver could be considered underinsured if they have less coverage than the minimum state requirements or if they cause an accident resulting in more injuries or damage than is covered by their insurance policy.Depending on your state, uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage may be bundled together. Like uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist insurance is divided into the same two components.Underinsured motorists bodily injury coverageUnderinsured motorist bodily injury (UIMBI) coverage pays for medical bills, wage loss, pain and suffering, and funeral expenses following an accident with a driver who is underinsured. It\\\\u2019s similar to UMBI coverage, except in this case, the driver does carry insurance \\\\u2013 just not enough to cover all the injury-related expenses.Consider a scenario in which a driver causes a multi-vehicle pileup, seriously injuring five people. If the driver\\\\u2019s liability insurance pays a maximum of $20,000 per accident, that probably wouldn\\\\u2019t be enough to cover all the doctor bills and medical payments.Having underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage can help cover your expenses after an at-fault driver\\\\u2019s insurance coverage is exhausted.Underinsured motorist property damage coverageUnderinsured motorist property damage (UIMPD) coverage pays for damage to vehicles and property after an accident caused by a driver who has insurance but not enough to cover all the damage they caused.If someone totals your expensive sports car in an accident, for example, their insurance coverage limits may not be enough to replace your vehicle. With underinsured motorist property damage coverage, your insurance can help make up the difference. Yahoo Personal FinanceDo you need uninsured motorist coverage?When deciding whether you should have uninsured motorist coverage, consider your state\\\\u2019s requirements, other insurance coverage you have, your risk tolerance, and your financial ability to cover out-of-pocket expenses.Your state\\\\u2019s requirements and risk factorsAs mentioned, several states require drivers to have uninsured motorist coverage when registering a vehicle. A handful of them also require underinsured motorist coverage. If you live and drive in those states, your decision is made up for you \\\\u2013 you\\\\u2019ll need to get that additional coverage.You can also opt into purchasing uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage on your own. Consider your risk tolerance and how comfortable you\\\\u2019d feel covering car repairs or medical bills if an uninsured driver crashed into you.The prevalence of uninsured drivers in your state is another factor. According to the Insurance Research Council, the 10 states with the highest percentage of insured drivers are:Mississippi \\\\u2013 29.4%Michigan \\\\u2013 25.5%Tennessee \\\\u2013 23.7%New Mexico \\\\u2013 21.8%Washington \\\\u2013 21.7%Florida \\\\u2013 20.4%Alabama \\\\u2013 19.5%Arkansas \\\\u2013 19.3%Washington, D.C. \\\\u2013 19.1%California \\\\u2013 16.6%The 10 states with the lowest percentage of insured drivers are:New Jersey \\\\u2013 3.1%Massachusetts \\\\u2013 3.5%New York \\\\u2013 4.1%Maine \\\\u2013 4.9%Wyoming \\\\u2013 5.8%Pennsylvania \\\\u2013 6.0%New Hampshire \\\\u2013 6.1%Connecticut \\\\u2013 6.3%Utah \\\\u2013 6.5%North Carolina and South Dakota (tied) \\\\u2013 7.4%What happens if you don\\\\u2019t have uninsured motorist coverage?If your state doesn\\\\u2019t require you to have uninsured motorist coverage, you might still be able to purchase it from your insurance company. However, you can choose not to.In the event that you do get into an accident caused by an uninsured driver, you might have to pay for your own medical bills and car repair costs if the responsible driver can\\\\u2019t cover those expenses for you.If you have health insurance, your medical bills following an accident might be covered, but you may have a copay, co-insurance, or a high deductible to meet first. Even if your auto insurance policy includes personal injury protection (PIP), it may not be enough to cover all the expenses related to your car accident injury.Having short- or long-term disability coverage can be useful, but it\\\\u2019ll typically only pay a portion of your wages, so you might still experience income loss if you aren\\\\u2019t able to return to work after being in a car accident.Collision insurance may help pay your car repair bills if an uninsured motorist hits your vehicle, but it may not cover damage to a fence, mailbox, house, or other property.If you choose not to get uninsured motorist coverage, it can be helpful to regularly set aside money in a high-yield savings account to cover expenses in case you get into an accident with an uninsured driver. This could be your emergency fund or an account specifically for car-accident-related expenses.

Consumers across the country are getting a shock when they get their policy renewal notice. Car insurance costs vary based on location, demographics, number of car accidents, type of vehicle and other factors, but insurance rates are up steeply for most drivers this year.Here\\'s what experts say is behind inflated car insurance prices and what you can do to save money without sacrificing thorough coverage on your vehicles.How much did car insurance increase in 2023?According to the 2023 US Auto Insurance Study from J.D. Power, 31% of car insurance companies operating in the US enacted a rate increase this past year. Overall, the industry reported an average price increase of 15.5% with some states, like Florida, seeing rates rise as much as 88% over the past year.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) confirms that even as inflation eased in 2023, auto insurance costs rose more than 17% for US drivers. Progressive estimates its average cost of car insurance for a liability-only policy ranges from $81-$146 a month. But you might pay far more than that depending on your coverage, driver demographics, vehicle value, and which state you live in.8 ways to save on auto insurance premiumsWhen it comes to personal finance, the forecast isn\\\\u2019t all doom and gloom. Loretta Worters with the Insurance Information Institute says drivers can explore plenty of options before kicking their insurance company to the curb.\\\\u201cBefore changing your carrier,\\\\u201d Worters said, \\\\u201cconsider some factors that can affect your rates and learn how an annual insurance checkup can position you to get the coverage right for you.\\\\u201d1. Keep (or work toward) a clean driving recordSome factors that affect auto insurance prices, like age or gender, aren\\\\u2019t always within your control. But a careless at-fault accident or a speeding ticket can lead to a rate increase from your insurer.2. Choose a cheaper carMichael J. McCartin, president of Joseph W. McCartin Insurance and a Trusted Choice Independent Agent, encourages customers to contact an agent before they start vehicle shopping. \\\\\"Call your independent agent before you purchase a new car. Some cars are less expensive to insure. Ask in advance about what an estimate of the premium might be.\\\\\"Here are the five vehicles that top Mercury Insurance\\\\u2019s 2023 list of the cheapest new cars to insure:Chevrolet SparkMazda 2VW GolfHyundai AccentToyota Prius Prime3. Shop around to save on insuranceIf you\\\\u2019ve been with the same company for a while, shop around for new car insurance quotes on a yearly basis. You can also consult with an independent insurance agent to see which insurer might be the best fit for your family or fleet of vehicles.4. Consider telematicsMost insurance companies now offer discounts through usage-based insurance. Drivers download an app or install a plug-in device that monitors mileage, driving habits, speed, and more.According to TransUnion, the usage of telematics surged 33% in early 2022 as inflation drove drivers to seek out deeper discounts on car insurance.5. Maximize insurance discountsInsurance companies offer a full menu of discounts and it can be difficult to ascertain if you\\\\u2019re taking advantage of everything you\\\\u2019re eligible for.Ask about student discounts, senior discounts, military and veteran discounts, and any discounts for safe driving, taking a defensive driving course, or enrolling in traffic school.6. Bundle with your renters or homeowners insuranceMcCartin, the agent, says drivers struggling with their insurance bill need to realize everyone is in the same situation.\\\\\"There are not a lot of options when it comes to auto insurance and reducing rates right now,\\\\\" McCartin advises. \\\\\"Bundle your coverage with the same company for home and auto for a bigger discount.\\\\\"7. Work to raise your credit scoreWhat\\'s your credit score got to do with your car insurance? It turns out quite a lot. Insurance companies use a credit-based insurance score (CBIS) in their underwriting process to determine insurance rates. Making bill payments on time, paying down debt, and using credit cards responsibly will all improve your credit score and deem you less risky to insurers.8. Avoid reducing your coverage.You could try to raise your deductible or drop extra coverage, but carrying the minimum coverage on your vehicle that the state will allow is almost never advisable. Instead, try creative solutions to save money and reduce your insurance premiums, like enrolling in paperless billing, or paying annually.\\\\\"Take the highest deductible you can afford that makes sense,\\\\\" McCartin warns. \\\\\"But be mindful that at some point the savings does not justify the additional increase in a deductible.\\\\\" Yahoo Personal FinanceWhat\\\\u2019s causing car insurance rate hikes?Curious why you\\\\u2019re suddenly paying more, even for the same car insurance policy you had last year?Experts say rising car insurance premiums are a result of several factors converging over the past few years to create steep losses for insurance companies and thus a steep increase in insurance rates.Here are just a few of the factors driving auto insurance rate hikes.High repair costsRising repair costs are being attributed to more expensive auto parts, aging vehicles, supply chain concerns, and labor shortages. Similar to auto insurance rate hikes, the CPI reports the cost of vehicle maintenance and repairs rose about 20% for most customers in 2023.McCartin says vehicle repair costs are indeed part of the problem. \\\\u201cParts and labor costs have increased, many shops are short-handed so it takes longer to fix cars which means people are in a rental car for a longer period of time.\\\\u201dClimate changeInsurance company losses have hit historic highs as more frequent natural disasters and severe weather driven by climate change generate more claims for larger payouts. These types of catastrophic claims affect both auto and home insurance rates.State Farm, one of the largest insurers in the US, received permission to institute more than 65 rate hikes across 29 different states in early 2023 due to extraordinary losses.Rise in used car pricesAlongside other factors, the value of a used car can significantly affect the cost of coverage. Edmunds reports that used vehicle prices remain historically high with an average increase in value of 44% since 2018.Increase in severity of insurance claimsNow that most cars have returned to the road post-pandemic, so too have more accidents. According to a State Farm media release in early 2023, the company attributes its unprecedented $13.2 billion underwriting loss in 2022 to the increased severity of auto insurance claims.Worters confirms this has been a significant concern for auto insurers over the past year.\\\\\"It really is a convergence of factors, including rising insurer losses due to increasing accident frequency and severity,\\\\\" she said. \\\\\"There are also more fatalities and injuries on the road, leading to increased attorney involvement in claims.\\\\\"\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kaz Weida\",\"Article Date\":\"Wed, Sep 27, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How a government shutdown would impact your money: Student loans, Social Security, investments, and more\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/government-shutdown-money-153356710.html\",\"Article Content\":\"filo via Getty ImagesThe offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here\\'s an explanation of how we make money.If we were to manage our finances like the US government, we\\'d pay our utility bills just hours before service was shut off. Sometimes, only after we\\'re sitting in the dark.A government shutdown is looming on Oct. 1 because Congress hasn\\'t allocated the funds to pay existing bills. It\\'s similar to last June when US leaders agonized over raising the debt ceiling, an imaginary line in the sand on spending.These persistent standoffs don\\'t lower the national debt. They simply delay the payment of salaries, operational expenses, and services \\\\u2014 and are likely to continue because that\\'s how Washington works.Here\\'s how a government shutdown might affect you personally.Student loansA government shutdown can have a major impact on student loan borrowers. The government may temporarily lay off employees \\\\u2014 including a majority of those working for the Department of Education.In 2021, the DOE released a contingency plan in the event of a government shutdown, which said the DOE would \\\\\"phase in employees only as necessary to support and prevent significant damage.\\\\\" At most, it said, \\\\\"not more than 11 percent of the total staff would be called back to work during a longer interruption.\\\\\"The operations that would come to a halt largely affect grants \\\\u2013 specifically, review of grant applications and awarding of grant funds.DOE programs with mandatory funding, such as the Pell Grant and Federal Direct Student Loan programs, can still make payments during a shutdown. However, it may only be for a limited time \\\\u2014 as long as funds are still available.What\\\\u2019s different about this potential shutdown? After a three-year student loan moratorium, federal student loan providers are bracing for an overwhelming influx of payments on Oct. 1.Having fewer federal employees on the clock could make it more difficult to ask questions or resolve issues related to your student loans.Federal programs and Social Security, Medicare, and MedicaidSocial Security checks and electronic payments would still be delivered even if the government shuts down. Medicare and Medicaid programs are also protected from federal funding shortfalls.We\\\\u2019ll repeat that for those in the back: Retirees will still get their monthly Social Security checks and healthcare benefits will not be disrupted.SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) and WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) benefits can continue if the funding shutdown is not for an extended time. Operating on a tight budget, WIC may be the most vulnerable.TravelMany federal workers, including airport security and air traffic control, are considered essential and required to continue furloughed work during a government shutdown. But you should still be prepared for potential delays and slower wait times at the airport.During the last shutdown, travelers experienced longer lines at TSA checkpoints, flight delays, and other disruptions to their travel.Other services may differ. If you need to update your passport or obtain a visa before travel, the US State Department says services will be operational as long as fees are available to support them. Still, issuance of passports could be delayed. Additionally, it\\\\u2019s possible national parks and museums could close, or offer only limited services.In short: The longer a potential shutdown drags on, the more disruptive it could be to your travel plans.If you\\\\u2019re concerned about long security lines, consider signing up for TSA PreCheck now. Several credit cards offer a credit toward your application fee, including the Chase Sapphire Reserve\\\\u00ae, Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, and Bank of America\\\\u00ae Premium Rewards\\\\u00ae credit card.You may not qualify for coverage if you miss your flight due to long security lines, but travel insurance could also be useful in the case of a flight delay or cancellation. Some credit cards with travel insurance include the Chase Sapphire Preferred\\\\u00ae Card and The Platinum Card\\\\u00ae from American Express. Always read the fine print to ensure a policy covers what you need, and don\\\\u2019t forget to also check your airline or hotel\\\\u2019s flexible cancellation policies.Read more: Government shutdowns usually cause trouble at airports. This time could be worse.The economy and your investmentsThe impact on the economy, including your investments, will depend on the length of a government shutdown. Since government payments are delayed, not diminished, the effect may be minor if congressional leaders resolve the matter quickly.During the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted a little over two weeks, 40% of Americans cut their consumer spending, according to a Goldman Sachs survey.For the stock and bond markets, investor sentiment may be jarred over the short term. That could mean temporary market volatility. In other words, you might not want to check your 401(k) retirement balance or mutual fund statements quite so often.

But if you\\\\u2019re on a shoestring budget, saving for your own burial expenses might be a little daunting.In 2021, the National Funeral Directors Association data indicates the median cost of an adult funeral was $7,848 with viewing and burial. Fortunately, burial insurance is an affordable tool that can help cover those funeral costs as well as other end-of-life expenses.What is burial insurance?Burial insurance, sometimes referred to as funeral insurance or final expense life insurance, is a type of whole life insurance designed to cover the costs associated with burial, funeral home services, and other final expenses.There are several kinds of burial insurance policies, and while each offers a death benefit, there are specific differences in coverage and how benefits are structured.In general, funeral insurance isn\\\\u2019t designed to leave a large amount of money to your beneficiaries. Instead, it\\\\u2019s a way for the insured to provide financial support after their death so their families don\\'t have to run up credit card bills trying to carry out end-of-life wishes.How does burial insurance work?Burial insurance works differently depending on whether you\\\\u2019ve opted for a traditional life insurance policy that covers burial expenses or a final expense policy through a funeral home. The following are the three main types of burial policies.Simplified life insuranceA simplified life insurance policy requires the insured to answer basic health-related questions, although a medical exam is not necessary. While these burial life insurance policies are more affordable than guaranteed issue policies, simplified life insurance coverage usually has a graded death benefit. That means your beneficiaries don\\\\u2019t get the full insurance payout if you pass within a few years of taking out the policy.Guaranteed issue life insuranceGuaranteed issue policies are pretty much what they sound like. You\\\\u2019ll have to be 50 or older to qualify, but there are no health questions or medical exams and you can\\\\u2019t be denied coverage. The premiums for this type of whole life insurance can be expensive and return relatively small death benefits.Pre-need insuranceThis type of burial policy isn\\\\u2019t offered through traditional life insurance companies. Instead, a funeral home can offer pre-need funeral insurance that will cover funeral expenses and other costs associated with arrangements. The caveat is that the funeral director needs to be a licensed insurance agent, and the full death amount goes directly to the funeral homes to cover funeral costs.The advantage to contracting with a life insurance company or burial insurance company versus a funeral home is that a whole life policy from an insurance company has cash value. This means once your beneficiaries cover the cost of your funeral expenses, the remaining funds can be used to pay other final expenses such as medical bills.Read more: The total guide to life insuranceWhat does a burial insurance policy cover?Depending on the type of policy, burial insurance can cover specific funeral costs or a wide array of other expenses associated with the end of life. Here are a few of the costs to consider when you\\\\u2019re deciding your coverage amount.Burial plot or cremationEmbalming or preservationGrave and headstoneObituary noticesCasket or urnFlowersTransportationMusicFuneral or memorial service feesIf you\\\\u2019ve chosen a whole life insurance policy, there are a few other expenses the death benefit can be used to pay such as medical bills, legal costs, or even the insured\\\\u2019s outstanding debt such as mortgage loans or personal loans. Consult the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to understand what happens to debts upon death and who\\\\u2019s financially responsible.Burial insurance policy vs. life insurance policyMost burial insurance policies are a type of life insurance policy. In fact, some insurance companies don\\\\u2019t even offer stand-alone burial insurance.Burial insurance is really just a term for whole or universal life insurance that pays a small death benefit to cover the deceased person\\\\u2019s final expenses. Term life insurance pays out a larger death benefit meant to replace the income of the deceased person to support their beneficiaries.If you\\\\u2019re under 50 and have a young family, the generous death benefit of a term life insurance policy is probably more appropriate for your situation. If you\\\\u2019re over 50 and retired, the lower cost of burial insurance may make more sense.Read more: What is term life insurance?How much does burial insurance cost?Burial insurance premiums are fairly affordable, even for older applicants. However, coverage and benefit amounts can vary depending on whether the insured is willing to answer a policy health questionnaire and how much underwriting is involved.eFinancial, an insurance marketplace, says final expense insurance rates start at $53 per month with coverage ranging from $5,000 to $35,000. Choice Mutual has a more specific breakdown where 50-70-year-olds pay premiums anywhere from $12-$193 per month depending on age, gender, health conditions, and the coverage needed.How much burial insurance do I need?Given that the average cost of a funeral is over $7,000 depending on whether cremation or burial is involved, most burial insurance policy coverage starts at a death benefit of $5,000.To decide how much coverage you\\\\u2019ll need, consider the funeral costs outlined on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website or use the New York Life online funeral cost and final expense calculator.Alternatives to traditional burial or funeral insuranceIf you\\\\u2019re trying to decide if burial insurance is worth it or looking to save money, consider the following alternatives.Burial or other trustYou can work with an attorney to create a trust that would set aside money for funeral costs and name a trustee that could withdraw the money upon your death. In this case the trust owns the life insurance policy.Payable on death (POD)Some banks offer an option to create an account that\\\\u2019s payable upon presentation of a certified death certificate to a specific beneficiary. POD accounts avoid having funds tied up in probate and allow you to still access the money while you\\\\u2019re alive.Savings accountYou can also squirrel away funds for a funeral in a joint savings account. However, these types of accounts can get tied up in probate so they\\\\u2019re not always the best solution to address immediate end-of-life needs like funeral expenses.What happens when there\\\\u2019s no money for a funeral?And last but not least, what happens if there isn\\\\u2019t any cash on hand for a funeral? A few of the following programs work to subsidize funeral costs for families.Veterans burial benefitsThe federal government\\\\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs works to defer the funeral costs of both veterans and active-duty military personnel. The amount awarded or reimbursed depends on several factors, including when the death occurred and if it was service-related.FEMA assistanceThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) works with state agencies to cover the costs related to funerals for many natural disasters, including COVID-19-related deaths. See the FEMA website for more information about how to apply for assistance.State government assistanceIf you can\\\\u2019t afford a funeral for a loved one, many states have organizations that work to provide relief and funeral services. You can search a state-by-state directory of burial assistance programs here.Victim compensation fundsIf the deceased was the victim of a crime, the family may be entitled to financial support for funeral-related costs from the state crimes victims compensation fund.

Or in 1981, when mortgages were over 18%? Yeah, that\\'s an easy one. But maybe you didn\\'t have the down payment in the bank two or three years ago. Or, for any number of reasons, you just weren\\'t ready to buy a house.Now it\\'s 2023, mortgage rates are around 7%, home prices are still elevated, and you\\'re thinking, \\\\\"Great. It\\'s the worst possible time to buy a house.\\\\\"But is it?Buying a house in 2023: What you need to knowThe elephant in the living room of that dream home you want to buy is the combination of high mortgage rates and home prices. The interest rate you will likely pay today was last seen in 2002. The median home price then was around $170,000. Today, the median house price is over $400,000.Mortgage rates bounced up and down in the 7% range in the 1990s, too. And in the early \\'70s. They\\'ve been much, much higher \\\\u2014 and much lower. That\\'s what mortgage rates do.However, over the decades, despite the cyclical nature of mortgage rates, median home prices have generally risen throughout interest rate cycles.Of course, as you can see by the occasional dips (or cliffs) in home values, including the five-year drop beginning in 2007 and the most recent fall in prices, houses don\\'t always appreciate over the short term. Much like the stock market, a home is a buy-and-hold asset.So, presently, interest rates are no longer historically low, and home prices have been on an increasing trajectory for decades. Choosing to buy a home based on the perfect timing of low mortgage rates and affordable home prices is rarely, if ever, possible. Over the long term, home prices are likely to continue appreciating, and since rates move up and down over time, refinancing opportunities may crop up as the years go on.First-time homebuyers: What\\'s changed in 2023Besides mortgage rates? The most significant change is the share of homebuyers who are first-timers is at its highest level in over a decade. Half of all homebuyers were first-timers in 2022, according to Zillow research.The buying frenzy of bidding wars and red-hot housing markets seen during the years of record-low interest rates is over. Part of the reason is because potential repeat buyers are staying put with their existing low-rate mortgages. With less buying competition, first-time homebuyers may have more of an opening to make a deal.Repeat homebuyers: The 2023 mortgage rate challengeAccording to another Zillow report, current homeowners may stay put for quite some time. The report says that would-be repeat buyers are looking for mortgage rates to dip back down to 4% and 5% before giving up their lower-rate home loan.As a result, buyers are once again seeking out temporary mortgage rate buydowns and adjustable-rate mortgages.Buydowns allow for two to three years of lower-interest payments in exchange for an upfront fee. And ARMs enable buyers to lock in a slightly lower interest rate for a few years before annual or semiannual rate adjustments later. It\\'s essentially a bet that interest rates will head lower in a couple of years, allowing for a fixed-rate refinance.ARMs can also be suitable for buyers expecting to move again before the introductory fixed-rate shifts to variable interest.How much house can I afford?A quick and easy formula for home affordability can be calculating 28% of your monthly before-tax-and-deductions (gross) income. That amount should cover your mortgage payment, insurance, taxes, and other housing costs.Lenders will look for a total debt load of 36% or less of your gross pay. That would include housing costs, plus monthly minimum credit card payments, vehicle loans, personal loans, and any other debt.How much money do I need to buy a house?Now, we\\'re getting to the essential details. Just how much money do you need on hand to buy a house? The down payment will be the biggest chunk of cash that you\\'ll need. That can range from 3% of the purchase price (some lenders even offer 1%-down loans) to the optimum 20%. \\\\\"Optimum\\\\\" because with 20% or more down, you won\\\\u2019t be charged private mortgage insurance. PMI is a fee that protects the lender in the event that you default on the loan.Other low- and no-down-payment options are available, which we\\'ll cover next.When you make an offer on a house, you\\'ll likely have to put up some earnest money with your written offer. That can be from several hundred to a couple thousand dollars. But don\\'t worry, this isn\\'t a new chunk of cash. It\\'s a small slice from your down payment and will be applied to the total money down later.Then there are closing costs. Figure those will amount to another 3%-4% of the home\\'s selling price.Lenders will also want to see a cash cushion available for maintenance, repairs, furniture, and other related expenses, such as moving costs.Let\\'s do a back-of-an-envelope rough estimate based on a $300,000 home:At the minimum, you might qualify for a conventional loan with a 3% down payment. So that\\'s $9,000. A National Association of Realtors report said that first-time homebuyers typically made a 6% down payment in 2022, while repeat buyers put down 17%. You can adjust your estimate according to your down payment plans.Closing costs could range from $9,000 to $13,000, or 3%-4% of the loan amount. These fees typically include an appraisal, inspection, title insurance and other prepaid and escrow funds required. Your lender will provide details in a Loan Estimate \\\\u2014 and the final figures in a Closing Disclosure three business days before closing.Home maintenance and repairs: It\\'s good practice to have some cash on hand, just in case there are some early expenses to cover. Let\\'s say $1,000 to $2,000.Moving expenses could vary a lot, depending on distance and how much stuff you have. Got friends or relatives with a truck and some strong backs? Maybe $100 for pizza and beer. If not, figure $2,000 to $5,000.That\\'s a ballpark minimum of around $20,000.How to buy a house with no money in 2023Mortgages requiring no down payment are widely available through two primary programs: the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.VA loans are, by far, the most-used method to no-money-down homeownership. As of June 2023, the VA said 3.7 million veterans had active home loans guaranteed by the agency. Loans backed by the VA are issued by mortgage lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and other loan providers. To be eligible, you must be a U.S. veteran, current service member or a qualified surviving spouse.USDA loans are for the funding of a primary residence of low- and moderate-income borrowers \\\\u2014 but aren\\'t just for residences built on property with agricultural purposes. They can be single-family homes in rural and suburban areas, too.If you don\\'t qualify for either of these two government loan programs, there are local and state housing finance agencies that offer aid, grants, and down payment assistance to low- and moderate-income households. There are also programs to assist teachers and first-responders to buy a home.The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has resources to help you learn more about homebuying-assistance programs.The 2023 first-time homebuyer federal tax creditA federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which ended in 2010, has been up for renewal time and time again in Congress, including earlier in 2023. The latest proposed version would allow a $15,000 credit against your federal income tax bill. So far, the measure hasn\\'t been approved.Credit score needed to buy a houseThe lowest interest rates are earned by borrowers with a FICO score of 760 or better, according to credit services provider Experian. More expensive homes are financed with jumbo loans and generally require a credit score of 700 or better.Service members and veterans can tap the benefit of a VA-backed loan, with lenders generally looking for applicants with a 620 FICO score or better. Lenders making conventional loans, which aren\\'t backed by a government agency, also look for credit scores of 620 or higher.Rural and suburban homes might qualify for a USDA loan with a 580 credit score. And you might even be eligible for a mortgage with a credit score as low as 500 with an FHA loan \\\\u2014 but a lender could require 10% cash down.Yahoo Finance tip: Know your credit score and use this calculator to get an idea of the rate you may qualify for.How to buy a house with bad creditAs just noted, FHA offers the lowest credit score hurdle to buying a house, at 500. Having a decent down payment helps make your case with a lender. Of course, working to build your credit score before buying a home is probably the best option. Actions to consider include:Make sure your credit report is accurate. Many people who haven\\'t checked their credit record in a while find long-lingering errors that can be corrected, according to Consumer Reports.Investigate government homebuying-assistance programs as mentioned above.Pay down debt. Every dollar decrease in debt works toward boosting your credit score.Pay every bill on time. And paying early can help polish your credit profile by lowering your credit utilization, a measure of debt used by credit score providers.Finding a co-signer \\\\u2014 perhaps a family member \\\\u2014 with good credit to help guarantee the home loan may also be a path to homeownership until your credit history recovers.Yahoo Finance tip: Getting a mortgage with bad credit means your interest rate will be higher. That can be a long-term penalty for what may be short-term credit issues. Repairing your credit before buying a house might be the best financial decision.How long does it take to buy a house?This question is difficult to answer because it depends on your circumstances. But here are some general parameters.Getting financially prepared can take weeks or months \\\\u2014 or much longer. You\\\\u2019ll also want to get your records in order for the loan underwriting process. That can include tax returns, bank statements, proof of income, and other paperwork.Then there\\'s shopping for a lender and getting a preapproval in hand. That\\'s a week or two, at least.Finding the right house might take a couple of months or more. In 2022, the NAR said it took home shoppers a median of 10 weeks before finding their next address.Making an offer on a house can take a week or two of possible give-and-take bargaining.Then, the mortgage process begins. HUD estimates that lenders will take 3-6 weeks to complete the loan approval process.The three-day countdown to loan signing begins when you receive the Closing Disclosure.Then, an hour or so around the closing table, and you\\'re done.13 steps to buying a home in 2023Breaking down the homebuying process can make it less overwhelming. Here are the landmarks you will want to achieve along the way:1. Know how much house you can affordTo start, you\\'ll want to determine what you can comfortably spend. If you properly gauge your financial capacity, your monthly mortgage payment will feel right from the beginning and get even easier to make over time.Divide your pre-tax monthly salary by four. That\\'s a good start for a target monthly payment. But that\\'s not just principal and interest payments. You will also want to include property taxes and homeowners\\' insurance in the total. Mortgage lenders often recommend your housing costs total around 28% of your gross pay. That calculation is known as your debt-to-income ratio.2. Be financially preparedYou need to lay a solid financial foundation for homeownership to be comfortable with the ongoing costs of owning a home.Reduce debtPrioritize paying off debt before buying a home. You\\'ll have plenty of new expenses after you move in and will want to have extra spending power available.Check your credit scoreKnowing your credit score is a must. Many financial services providers offer FICO scores for free, and the numbers will vary a bit from each. Knowing generally where you fall on the bad-to-excellent scale will suffice. The higher your score, the better your bargaining power for a lower interest rate and fewer fees.Have a cash cushionLenders want to see that you\\'ve got some money left over after making the down payment and covering the closing costs. It doesn\\'t have to be a huge amount, but showing that you have a bit of a cash cushion during the purchase and once in the home is a good thing.3. Bank the down paymentThat lump sum down payment has to be in a savings account or somewhere readily accessible. From the minimum 1% of the purchase price to the preferred 20% down, or anywhere in between, it\\'s got to be money ready to be in motion.4. Shop lenders for the best mortgageIt seems people may have finally learned this lesson. Over the last nearly 10 years, over 60% of homebuyers said they shopped more than one lender, according to Fannie Mae research. Gone are the days when buyers just went with a real estate agent\\'s \\\\\"preferred lender,\\\\\" no questions asked. Comparison shopping mortgage lenders for the best rate and most favorable fees is a thing. Don\\'t skip it.5. Get preapprovedGetting a written mortgage preapproval in hand is another step rarely taken for granted these days. That\\'s because real estate agents and home sellers want to be sure you\\'re a serious shopper.6. Find a buyer\\'s real estate agentNow you\\'re set to shop for that perfect house. Almost. You need the right real estate agent on your side \\\\u2014 and that\\'s not the seller\\\\u2019s agent shown on the \\\\\"for sale\\\\\" sign or the \\\\\"listing agent\\\\\" named in the home\\\\u2019s online profile. Talk to two or three buyer\\\\u2019s agents and find a strong negotiator and advocate.7. Find a house (or two)The fun part: looking at houses. Sure, you skipped down to this house-hunting step a bit early, right? Not to worry, because now that you\\'ve completed steps 1 through 6, it\\'s time for a serious search for the perfect home. Attend some open houses and scour the local market for neighborhoods and amenities that best suit you. Find a couple of contenders: one to make an offer on and some backup options if your favorite falls through.8. Make an offerYour buyer\\'s agent will handle the details of making an official offer and negotiating counteroffers.9. Get a home inspection and appraisalThen comes a home inspection and home appraisal. Both protect you from unknown problems and a valuation issue. Inspection issues could include things such as a leaky roof, mold or plumbing and electrical problems. The appraisal assures the lender that the property is worth enough to warrant a loan approval \\\\u2014 and alerts you to the possibility of overpaying for a property that may be worth a lot less than you thought.10. Shop for homeowner\\'s insuranceIt\\'s time to shop again, this round for insurance. Your lender will require it, and of course, you need it. It\\'s another round of comparison shopping between multiple providers. Bundle and save? You\\'ve got to put every sales pitch to a numbers test.11. Choose your lender and apply for a mortgageWith an offer in hand, you can get real-deal loan offers. Each lender vying for your business will give you a written offer. If you have each lender provide a zero-discount-points offer, you can compare apples to apples and then decide if you want to buy points to lower your interest rate.12. Do a final walk-throughBefore closing, you\\'ll do one more walk-through with your agent to ensure everything is as promised. Repairs, if any, are completed; things like that.13. Close the loanYou\\'ll face a pile of paperwork, so be patient. Ask questions and understand what you\\'re signing. If there are any last-minute surprises, you can still walk away. But don\\'t worry, that\\'s not likely to happen.

In addition to an assured death benefit, whole life insurance has a built-in savings component called cash value.If you have loved ones who depend on your income, you probably need life insurance. Whole life insurance provides a number of benefits, but it\\\\u2019s also expensive compared to other types of policies. Let\\\\u2019s break down how whole life insurance works and when it makes sense.What is whole life insurance?Whole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance. It\\\\u2019s sometimes referred to as ordinary life insurance.Unlike term life insurance, which only pays a death benefit if you die within a specific number of years, whole life policies and other forms of permanent life insurance will pay a death benefit no matter when you die as long as your policy remains in force. These policies also have a cash value component that grows over time.There are a few important differences between whole life policies and other types of permanent life policies, like universal life insurance and variable life insurance:Whole life insurance has a guaranteed death benefit. As long as you make your premium payments, your loved ones will receive a death benefit when you pass. Universal life and variable life policies offer long-term financial protection, but the death benefits aren\\\\u2019t guaranteed.Cash value grows at a guaranteed rate. With universal life and variable life, cash values fluctuate based on market conditions. The cash value of a whole life insurance policy grows at a rate guaranteed by the insurer.Whole life premiums stay the same throughout the life of the policy. Universal life and variable life offer greater flexibility in that you can adjust your premiums if your needs change.Many whole life policies pay dividends. If you buy participating life insurance, your whole life insurance policy may pay dividends, depending on its financial performance.How much does whole life insurance cost?The cost of a whole life policy depends on several factors, namely your age, health, and the face amount of the policy, i.e. how much the insurer will pay out to beneficiaries when the policyowner dies.Whole life is more expensive than other types of life insurance, including other permanent life options. Premiums on a $500,000 policy, even for a healthy person in their 30s, can cost a few hundred dollars a month. Older people will pay more.Pros and cons of whole life insuranceWhole life insurance offers several benefits for those seeking lifelong coverage, but it isn\\\\u2019t the right choice for everyone.Benefits of whole life insuranceSome of the most important benefits of whole life insurance compared to other types of life insurance include:Guaranteed death benefitWhole life insurance is a good option if you want to leave an inheritance to family members or make a substantial gift to charity when you die. It can be an especially helpful estate-planning tool for parents of special-needs children who want to provide long-term financial security.Permanent coverageWhole life insurance lasts your entire life. The permanent coverage is a key advantage over a term life insurance policy, which only pays a death benefit if you die within the policy\\\\u2019s term, typically between 10 and 30 years.Cash valueYou can borrow against the cash value or make withdrawals from it. Some people use the cash value of whole life insurance to supplement their retirement income. The insurer guarantees the growth rate of the cash value.Fixed premiumsWhole life insurance premiums don\\\\u2019t change during the life of the policy. While you don\\\\u2019t have to worry about the cost increasing, the downside is that there\\\\u2019s little flexibility. Also, premiums cost a lot more in the early years than the cost of insuring your life.Potential for dividendsIf the insurer pays life insurance dividends, your cash value can grow faster than your carrier\\\\u2019s guaranteed rate. You can use the annual dividends to grow your policy\\\\u2019s death benefit or cash value, reduce your premiums, or take them as cash. Bear in mind, though, that dividends aren\\\\u2019t guaranteed.Disadvantages of whole life insuranceWhile the guaranteed death benefits, lifetime coverage and cash value are appealing, there are some drawbacks to whole life insurance that you need to be aware of.High premiumsPerhaps the biggest disadvantage of whole life insurance is the high cost. A whole life policy can be up to 15 times more expensive than a 20- or 30-year term policy with a similar death benefit. Dollar for dollar, term policies allow you to buy a much larger death benefit.Insurers maintain level premiums throughout the life of the policy by charging younger policyholders substantially more than it costs to insure them in the early years. The company uses the high premiums that younger people pay to offset the costs of insuring older people\\\\u2019s lives.Slow cash value accumulationThe cash value accumulation rate that whole life insurance carriers guarantee is relatively low. Universal life insurance and variable life insurance offer higher potential growth, though both require you to assume some market risk. If you don\\\\u2019t need lifetime coverage, skipping permanent coverage altogether and investing the money you\\\\u2019d save on premiums will often yield better returns.Lack of flexibilityA disadvantage of those fixed premiums and guaranteed benefits is that whole life insurance doesn\\\\u2019t allow for much flexibility. Unlike universal and variable life policies, whole life insurance doesn\\\\u2019t give you the option to adjust your premiums and death benefit amounts.High surrender feesCanceling a whole life policy can get complicated. You can surrender your policy in exchange for the cash value, minus fees. The amount you\\\\u2019d receive is known as the cash surrender value. However, these fees can run as high as 10% to 35% of the policy\\\\u2019s cash value. Usually, the fees are especially steep in the early years, then decrease later on.ComplexityBecause it\\\\u2019s both an insurance product and a savings\\\\/investment product, whole life insurance can get confusing. Usually, you\\\\u2019ll need to shop for coverage through a life insurance agent instead of getting quotes online.How whole life insurance worksAs with other life insurance policies, your whole life premiums and death benefits are determined during the underwriting process. Typically, the insurer assesses your risk through a health questionnaire, a life insurance medical exam and third-party information, such as your prescription history and driving record.Whole life premiums are significantly higher compared to other life insurance policies. With any life insurance policy, your premiums go toward the insurer\\\\u2019s overhead expenses, along with the cost of insuring your life. But with whole life coverage, a portion of the premium also goes toward cash value. Because the insurer pays a death benefit as long as you keep the policy active, the cost of insuring your life is high. After all, everyone dies at some point.When you die, your beneficiaries will receive a lump-sum death benefit that\\\\u2019s typically tax-free. However, any remaining cash value that\\\\u2019s left at the time of your passing will go to the life insurance company instead of your beneficiaries.Cash value in whole life insuranceThe cash value of a whole life policy will grow over time, but accumulation is often minimal at the beginning. In fact, some policies won\\\\u2019t build cash value for the first two to five years.The insurer guarantees that cash value will grow at a minimum rate. However, cash value can grow at a faster rate if the insurer pays dividends.A whole life policyholder has several choices for how to use their cash value. Some options come with hefty fees and may reduce the death benefit, though, and so be sure to get details from your insurer first.Borrow from it: You can take a policy loan against the cash value, but if you haven\\\\u2019t repaid the loan plus interest by the time you die, the death benefit is reduced by the loan balance. Loans from a whole life policy don\\\\u2019t require a credit check, nor will they affect your credit score.Withdraw a portion: Depending on the policy, you may be able to withdraw part of the cash value, though doing so may also reduce your death benefit.Use it to pay premiums: You can use your cash value to offset your premiums. This tends to work well for retirees seeking to maintain coverage on a limited budget.Surrender it: With a cash value surrender, you\\\\u2019re essentially giving up your policy in exchange for your equity, i.e., the cash value. Expect significant fees if you surrender your policy early on \\\\u2014 and at that point your policy may not have accumulated much cash value. However, after 10 or 15 years, cash value surrender fees often go away.Whole life insurance vs. term life insuranceUnlike whole life insurance, term insurance isn\\\\u2019t considered an asset. It doesn\\\\u2019t build cash value or pay dividends. If you survive the term, the policy expires worthless. A typical term life policy offers coverage for no more than 30 years. Though you can usually renew the policy at the end of the term, you can expect higher premiums because your odds of dying increase as you get older.The big advantage of term life insurance is that it\\\\u2019s far more affordable than whole life insurance. Many people don\\\\u2019t need permanent coverage. They need financial protection until their children are grown, their mortgages and other debts are paid off, or they\\\\u2019re retired and no longer collecting a paycheck. Term life insurance is often sufficient in these situations.Policy riders and additional featuresIf you buy a whole life policy, you may also choose to add life insurance riders, which are optional features that typically come at an additional cost. Some common life insurance riders include:Accelerated death benefit rider: Allows you to access part of your policy\\\\u2019s death benefit if you become terminally ill. This feature is also known as a living benefit rider.Critical illness rider: Like an accelerated death benefit rider, but it allows you to access part of your death benefit if you\\\\u2019re diagnosed with a critical illness like cancer that could shorten your life expectancy, even if it doesn\\\\u2019t meet the definition of a terminal illness.Accidental death benefit: Increases the policy\\\\u2019s payout if you die due to an accident.Guaranteed insurability rider: Allows you to buy additional insurance without undergoing another medical exam.Long-term care rider: Provides a monthly benefit to assist with the costs of a skilled nursing facility should you require long-term care.Child rider and spousal rider: These riders offer a small death benefit if your child or spouse dies.Waiver of premium rider: Allows you to stop paying premiums while keeping your policy in force if you become disabled.Tax benefits and considerationsYou can\\\\u2019t take a tax deduction on your premiums on whole life insurance or any type of life insurance. However, death benefits are generally income tax-free for beneficiaries.Whole life insurance offers additional tax advantages. The cash value grows on a tax-deferred basis. Basically, if the money stays in the policy, you won\\\\u2019t pay taxes on the earnings. If you withdraw more than the policy\\\\u2019s cost basis, i.e., the amount you paid in premiums, the earnings will be taxable. But you won\\\\u2019t have any tax liability if you withdraw less than you\\\\u2019ve paid in.Choosing the right coverageYour first step in choosing the right life insurance is to determine how much coverage is necessary. There\\\\u2019s no precise formula for calculating your exact need, but many financial planners recommend replacing at least 10 years of your salary. You may want to aim for an even larger death benefit in some situations, like if you want to pay for your children\\\\u2019s education.You\\\\u2019ll be able to afford a much larger death benefit if you choose term life insurance vs. whole life insurance. But remember: A term policy provides only temporary coverage, while whole life insurance covers you in perpetuity.Also consider your financial goals. A whole life insurance policy may make sense if you want the built-in savings component you get through cash value. Whole life cash value has less growth potential than cash value in a universal life or variable life policy because it\\\\u2019s guaranteed. However, if you\\\\u2019re risk-averse, whole life insurance may feel like a safe, good investment compared to the permanent life insurance alternatives.Finding the best whole life policyTo buy whole life insurance, you\\\\u2019ll probably need to work directly with a life insurance agent, who can help you determine the right amount of coverage for your situation. Few carriers offer online quotes for whole life and other permanent life insurance policies. Once you\\\\u2019ve found a suitable policy, you\\\\u2019ll need to do your homework to find the best life insurance company. Here are some things you\\\\u2019ll want to know before signing an insurance contract:Number of complaints. The National Association of Insurance Commissioner\\\\u2019s complaint index shows you whether a company generates an above-average or below-average number of complaints relative to its size. A company that receives an average number of complaints will receive a score of 1.0, so look for a company that scores below 1.0.The company\\\\u2019s financial strength. Five independent agencies rate the financial health of insurers: A.M. Best, Fitch, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Moody\\\\u2019s, and Standard & Poor\\\\u2019s. Because each has different standards, check the ratings of a whole life insurance company with at least two different agencies.Your budget. Even if you\\\\u2019d prefer the lifetime coverage that whole life insurance offers, the premiums may be prohibitively expensive. Make sure you feel confident that you can afford the payments in the long term.Whole life insurance can get confusing since it\\\\u2019s both an insurance policy and a savings vehicle. Don\\\\u2019t sign a contract unless you\\\\u2019re confident you understand all the details.Most permanent life policies offer something called a life insurance illustration. This document shows you how your policy\\\\u2019s cash value and death benefit will grow over time based on the guaranteed values, as well as the insurer\\\\u2019s projections. Comparing illustrations from several life insurance companies can help you choose the best whole life policy.Conclusion: Is whole life insurance right for you?Whole life insurance coverage may be worth it if you want to leave a guaranteed death benefit to your heirs or a favorite charity. It can also be a good choice if you\\\\u2019re already maxing out your retirement accounts and want another tax-advantaged way to save. But be sure it fits into your long-term financial plans and budget to avoid a policy lapse.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Robin Hartill, CFP\\\\u00ae\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 25, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Will I be taxed on student loan forgiveness?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/tax-on-student-loan-forgiveness-182343895.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Since March 13, 2020, federal student loan borrowers haven\\'t had to think much about their student loan payments. The U.S. Department of Education suspended payments, interest was set at 0% and millions of borrowers hoped President Biden\\'s debt relief plan would come to fruition.But payments will resume soon \\\\u2014 and the Biden administration\\\\u2019s student loan debt forgiveness plan is no longer an option thanks to the Supreme Court\\'s June 2023 ruling \\\\u2014 so borrowers are taking another look at their debt.As you research available options, one factor is often overlooked: some forms of loan forgiveness are taxable. If you aren\\'t prepared, the taxes on student loan forgiveness can be significant.Do I have to pay income taxes on student loan forgiveness?According to the most recent Federal Student Aid Data Center data, 43.6 million people have outstanding federal student loans. For those struggling to manage their payments, loan forgiveness can seem like a dream come true. But student loan forgiveness tax consequences could lead to surprise bills \\\\u2014 sometimes called the student loan tax bomb \\\\u2014 when borrowers submit their tax returns.The IRS considers canceled debt, including most forms of student loan debt forgiveness or student loan discharge, to be taxable income.However, borrowers working toward loan forgiveness have been exempt from taxes thanks to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. This measure made forgiven student loans exempt from federal income taxes, but it only applies to loans that are discharged between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 20225.The American Rescue Plan applies to all student loan forgiveness programs but only affects federal income taxes. Although some states adopted similar measures for state income taxes, not all followed suit.As of 2023, Indiana, North Carolina, and Mississippi have stated that the balance of forgiven student loans will be taxed as income. Taxpayers in Arkansas, California, and Wisconsin could face the same fate \\\\u2014 the states are currently reviewing their tax laws and have yet to make a determination (as of June 2023).[A previous version of this article stated Minnesota was one of the states to declare that forgiven student loan balances would be taxed as income. In the most recent Minnesota legislative session, lawmakers voted to amend Minn. Stat. \\\\u00a7 290.0132, subd. 24, and \\\\\"permanently adopt the American Rescue Plan Act exclusion for discharged student loans...Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022.\\\\\"] Student loan forgiveness tax consequences after 2025The American Rescue Act\\'s provisions regarding student loan forgiveness taxes will end on December 31, 2025. From January 1, 2026 onward, how student loan forgiveness and discharge programs are taxed depends on the program.Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)Federal loan borrowers who work for non-profit organizations, government agencies or public service groups may qualify for PSLF if they work for a qualifying employer full-time for 10 years and make 120 qualifying monthly payments. After reaching those milestones, borrowers can apply for debt cancellation. Once approved, the government forgives the remainder of the federal loan balance.PSLF is one of the few programs that is excluded from federal income taxes; none of the forgiven loan amount is taxable as income.Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) DischargeIDR plans are for federal loan borrowers who have trouble affording their payments under the standard 10-year repayment plan. IDR plans extend the loan terms and base the borrower\\'s monthly payments on a percentage of their discretionary income. The four IDR plans are:Income-Based RepaymentIncome-Contingent RepaymentPay As You EarnRevised Pay As You EarnThe government will discharge the remainder if the borrower still has a balance at the end of their loan term. However, the forgiven loans are taxable as income at the federal and state levels.Important: President Biden announced the launch of the new SAVE IDR plan in June 2023. Under the SAVE plan, many borrowers could qualify for lower payments, and qualify for loan forgiveness in as little as 10 years. However, the new plan is being introduced in a phased approach, and all of its benefits won\\'t go into effect until 2024.Borrower Defense to Repayment DischargeBorrower Defense to Repayment Discharge is a program that eliminates federal student loans belonging to borrowers who their college misled, or if their schools engaged in misconduct and violated state laws.The IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have issued notices that clarify that loans discharged through Borrower Defense to Repayment are not taxable as income.Total and Permanent Disability Discharge (TPDD)TPDD applies to borrowers who become totally and permanently disabled. The government will discharge the remaining loan balance for eligible federal loan borrowers.How taxes are handled depends on when you qualify for discharge.If you received discharge before January 1, 2018, the discharged loan amount is subject to federal income taxes. Loans discharged between January 1, 2028, and December 31, 2025, are exempt from federal income taxes. How TPDD will be taxed in 2026 and beyond is not clear at this time.Tax on student loan forgiveness for private student loansPrivate student loans aren\\'t eligible for federal loan programs like PSLF or TPDD. But borrowers with private student loans may qualify for other loan forgiveness or discharge programs. For example, some private lenders will discharge the loans of borrowers who become totally and permanently disabled.The American Rescue Plan specifies that forgiven private student loans are also exempt from federal income taxes through the end of 2025. However, they may be subject to state income taxes.Frequently asked questionsCan I pay down my balance to lower my tax bill?Technically, you can pay down your loan balance to decrease your tax bill if you expect a loan discharge after 2025. But because those taxable programs are based on your income, you may have enough cash to pay down the debt; if you do, there\\'s a chance your payments will go up in the future, decreasing the effectiveness of the forgiveness program.How can I estimate how much I will owe in taxes due to student loan forgiveness?How much you will have to pay in taxes depends on the amount of loan forgiveness you receive and your tax bracket. You can use the American Institute of CPAs marginal tax rate calculator to see how loan forgiveness will impact your tax bill.The tool can give you a ballpark figure of how much you\\'ll owe so you can plan ahead. If you expect a large tax bill, setting aside a little cash every month in a high-yield savings account or CD can help you prepare.If Congress extends the Rescue Plan past 2025, how will that affect borrowers?If Congress extends the American Rescue Plan past 2025, borrowers seeking loan forgiveness through IDR discharge, TPDD, and private loan forgiveness programs would be exempt from federal income taxes. PSLF is never taxed as income, so any extensions wouldn\\'t impact borrowers working toward loan forgiveness through that program.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kat Tretina\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 21, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is the NCUA, and how does it work?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/what-is-ncua-how-does-it-work-101756101.html\",\"Article Content\":\"The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is a federal agency that oversees credit unions and insures the money people deposit in credit union accounts. In that way, it plays a very similar role to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the agency that insures bank deposits.Like the FDIC, the NCUA insures up to $250,000 per person, per bank, and per ownership category. The term ownership category is a way of describing who owns the account.What is the National Credit Union Administration?The NCUA regulates and insures 98% of credit unions in the United States. That includes all of the federally-chartered credit unions and the vast majority of state-chartered credit unions as well.Congress created the NCUA in 1970 to regulate federal credit unions. A three-member board oversees the agency. Board members are appointed by the president, approved by the Senate, and serve staggered six-year terms. The NCUA, however, isn\\\\u2019t funded by the government but entirely by premiums paid by the credit unions it insures and regulates.To see if the NCUA insures your credit union, look for the NCUA logo on credit union materials or use the NCUA\\\\u2019s search tool.What does the NCUA do?The NCUA provides multiple services for federally chartered credit unions, including:Insuring deposits made at the credit unionProviding licenses, called charters, for credit unions to operateMonitoring credit unions to ensure they follow applicable laws and good practicesThe NCUA is also responsible for managing the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, funded by participating credit unions. Money in this fund repays credit union members\\\\u2019 deposits if a credit union fails.What does NCUA insurance cover?The NCUA insures each credit union account up to $250,000 per person. The NCUA insures the following types of accounts:Savings accountsShare draft (checking) accountsCDsMoney market accountsIndividual retirement accountsFind the best HYSA ratesAlong with the types of accounts that the NCUA insures, there are also different ownership categories:Single accountsJoint accountsSome retirement accountsRevocable trust accountsIrrevocable trust accountsEmployee benefit accountsGenerally, all accounts in the same ownership category at the same credit union count toward the $250,000 insurance limit. Let\\\\u2019s say you have an individual savings account with a $10,000 balance and an individual money market account with a $10,000 balance. In that case, all your money would be insured because the total between the two is less than $250,000. Any money above the $250,000 amount would not be insured and likely would be lost if the credit union failed.You can insure more than $250,000 worth of deposits by spreading your money across credit unions and ownership categories. For example, money in a joint account is not combined with money from an individual account. Each joint account holder is also eligible for $250,000 in insurance. You can use the NCUA\\\\u2019s Share Insurance Estimator tool to determine if your money is insured.Some accounts are not covered by the NCUA, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, municipal securities, life insurance policies, and safety deposit boxes.What happens when a credit union fails?When a credit union fails and is closed, it enters liquidation, and the NCUA takes over its management. During liquidation, another credit union can buy the failed credit union, taking over its members, assets, and loans. In that case, your insured deposits would move to the new credit union. If a failed credit union isn\\\\u2019t bought, you would typically receive your deposit money within five days of the credit union closing.If your money is held in an NCUA-insured credit union, it\\\\u2019s safe as long as you don\\\\u2019t have more than $250,000 in accounts that fall under the same ownership category. If you have more than $250,000 on deposit at a credit union, be sure to read up on NCUA insurance specifics and consider seeking guidance from an employee of the credit union.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kate Rockwood\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 22, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How car insurance rates vary by age\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/car-insurance-rates-by-age-193712279.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Your age is more than just a number when it comes to getting car insurance.To insurers, your age is an indicator of how risky it is to insure you \\\\u2013 essentially, how likely you are to file costly claims. The riskier you\\\\u2019re perceived to be, the more the insurance company will charge you for coverage.In this article, we\\\\u2019ll explain how age impacts car insurance and explore car insurance rates by age.How age affects car insurance ratesWhen you seek out quotes for coverage, auto insurance companies will often ask you for your age or date of birth. This is because most companies use age to determine auto insurance rates.Age group classificationInsurance companies typically categorize drivers into age groups. It may not matter much to your insurance company if you\\\\u2019re 33 vs. 34, but the difference between being 23 vs. 43 will matter because that places you in a different age group.Typical car insurance age brackets are:Teens\\\\/young adults (ages 16-24)Experienced drivers (ages 25-39)Middle-aged drivers (ages 40-64)Senior drivers (ages 65+)Your insurance rates can still vary among others in your same age bracket. Age is far from the only component auto insurers consider when setting rates. However, you\\\\u2019re more likely to see a difference in your car insurance costs as you enter into different age brackets. Insurance companies associate each age bracket with a particular degree of risk.Statistical risk assessmentWith age comes experience and maturity, and that\\\\u2019s often reflected in a person\\\\u2019s driving abilities. Research shows teen drivers are more likely to get into car accidents than more experienced drivers. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death for teens 16 to 19, according to AAA.In addition, elderly drivers have a greater chance of having physical limitations (such as vision loss or cognitive decline) that can negatively impact their driving skills compared to their middle-aged counterparts.Insurance companies consider statistical data regarding age and the likelihood of filing insurance claims when setting car insurance rates, charging higher rates to drivers who are more likely to get into accidents to offset the potential financial loss. Conversely, drivers seen as less risky are generally rewarded with lower auto insurance premiums.Driving record and claims historyAge tends to have a significant influence on your driving record, another key rating factor.When you\\\\u2019re young and don\\\\u2019t have much experience on the road, an insurance company can\\\\u2019t rely on years of past driving history as evidence of whether you\\\\u2019re a bad or good driver.With several years of driving experience under your belt, you get the chance to sharpen your driving skills. You can successfully manage driving on congested highways or in inclement weather. You may qualify for car insurance discounts for being a safe driver and having a record free from any accidents, tickets or insurance claims.If you were involved in car accidents in the past, it\\\\u2019ll take a few years for those incidents to clear from your driving history. After that time has passed, you may qualify for lower insurance premiums, which is another reason some older drivers end up with better insurance rates.Car insurance age bracketsDrivers in the following age brackets often share similar characteristics, including their auto insurance risk factors.Young drivers (16-24)If you\\\\u2019ve noticed that news reports of car accidents often seem to involve young drivers, it\\\\u2019s not a coincidence. Drivers between the ages of 16 and 24 tend to be less experienced on the road and have higher accident rates. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that teen drivers are four times more likely to get into a car crash than drivers 20 and older.As a result, car insurance companies view young drivers as the most risky to insure. Drivers ages 16 to 24 tend to face the highest premiums compared to other age groups.However, young drivers who live with their parents can offset some of their high insurance costs by being added onto their parents\\\\u2019 policy rather than getting insurance on their own \\\\u2013 provided their parents have a good driving history. In addition, teens and young adults in school may be able to qualify for good-student discounts to lower the cost of their insurance premiums.Experienced drivers (25-39)After age 25, auto insurance rates tend to go down as experienced drivers are seen to be more responsible on the road and less likely to cause car accidents or file claims. Experienced drivers who can point to a solid driving history will typically be eligible for lower premiums.Car insurance rates start to stabilize at this point in life. Drivers in this age bracket can enjoy rather consistent auto insurance rates provided there isn\\\\u2019t much change in other factors such as location, credit score or marital status.Middle-aged drivers (40-64)Middle-aged drivers tend to enjoy the lowest car insurance rates. These drivers have had more time improving their driving skills, and likely more time has elapsed since incurring dings on their driving records in their youth.Drivers in this age range also may be more likely to benefit from insurance discounts if they own a home, are married, have good credit or drive safer vehicles.If you\\\\u2019re in this age group, it\\\\u2019s important to note that you could see a spike in your insurance rates if you have a teenage driver or elderly parent living with you. Some insurance companies require all eligible drivers in a household to be listed under your policy, since there\\\\u2019s a chance your teen or elderly parent could wind up getting the keys to your vehicle.Senior drivers (65+)While senior drivers \\\\u2013 ages 65 and up \\\\u2013 aren\\\\u2019t as risky to insure as, say, a 17-year-old, they generally face higher average rates than younger drivers in their 30s, 40s, or 50s.As drivers enter into older age, they have a greater potential of experiencing health conditions \\\\u2013 such as impaired vision or hearing, slower response times and cognitive decline \\\\u2013 that may negatively impact their driving abilities. Certain medications taken by senior drivers can impair driving, and seniors have a greater chance of suffering more severe bodily injury in an accident.According to the Centers for Disease Control, drivers 70 and older have higher automobile fatalities than middle-aged drivers.If you\\\\u2019re a senior driver, you can offset policy increases if you\\\\u2019re retired and no longer drive as much. Without a daily commute to work, you can maintain a low annual mileage on your vehicle, which is seen favorably by insurers.Senior drivers may also be eligible for insurance discounts, such as Nationwide\\\\u2019s defensive driving discount for older drivers.Age milestones and rate changesWhile you might not see much change in your insurance rates with each passing year, you\\\\u2019ll likely notice rate changes as you hit particular age milestones.Young drivers, from ages 16 to 24, often face the highest average costs. Once you\\\\u2019re 25, however, you can typically expect your costs to go down. Progressive, for example, states that rates drop about 9% on average for its customers once they turn 25.Drivers in their 30s, 40s, and 50s typically find themselves enjoying the least expensive car insurance prices of their lifetime \\\\u2013 unless, of course, they have a teenage motorist included on their policy.After age 65, when senior citizens benefit from discounts on other expenses like movie theater tickets and hotel lodging, car insurance rates tend to go up again, but not as high as teen drivers tend to see.Car insurance rates by ageThere is no standard formula to calculate car insurance rates based on age. Rates are individualized, and age is only one of many factors.On top of that, each insurance company evaluates criteria \\\\u2013 such as age, location, driving record, claims history and more \\\\u2013 in its own way to set rates.To give one company\\\\u2019s example, consider this data from Progressive on the average monthly rates of its customers who purchased policies from September 2020 to August 2021.Other criteria impacting car insurance ratesAge is not the only factor that can result in you scoring cheap car insurance \\\\u2014 or paying through the nose.Type of coverage and deductiblesThe amount of coverage you get for your vehicle will affect how much you pay. Carrying only liability insurance could save you money each month, but you\\\\u2019d be on the hook for replacing or fixing your vehicle if you cause an accident, a tree branch breaks your windshield or your car is stolen.Comprehensive insurance and collision insurance that are part of a full coverage policy give you more protection, but you\\\\u2019ll pay more in premiums.If you want to lower your insurance premium, you could elect to pay a higher deductible. Just be prepared to pay that higher amount out of pocket in the event that you\\\\u2019re in an accident.Type of car and vehicle usageThe type of vehicle you drive and how you use it play a major role in determining your car insurance rate. If your vehicle is more expensive to repair or the specific model is often a target for theft, you can expect to pay more for insurance. If your car has top safety and anti-theft features, you might pay less.Also, your car insurance premiums can go up if you put a lot of mileage on the car each year or if you\\\\u2019re using your car for business purposes.LocationWhere you live will have a major influence on your car insurance rates. Florida, for example, has some of the highest rates in the nation, while North Carolina is at the low end.Not only do individual states have their own minimum coverage requirements, but also your specific ZIP code comes with its own level of risk. If you live in a densely populated area with more road congestion and higher crime rates, you\\\\u2019ll likely pay more for car insurance than if you lived in a more rural, safer town.Credit scoreInsurance companies use credit scores to determine car insurance rates due to research that shows a correlation between a person\\\\u2019s credit score and their likelihood to file car insurance claims. Drivers with excellent credit tend to file less claims while those with poor credit tend to file more claims.Gender and marital statusYour gender and your marital status are other factors insurance companies use to determine auto insurance rates. Male drivers \\\\u2013 especially younger ones \\\\u2013 usually pay more for car insurance than female drivers, based on data showing that men are more frequently involved in serious car accidents. Insurance companies typically view married drivers as less risky to insure compared to single drivers and tend to offer them lower rates.Insurance providersEach insurance provider has its own underwriting process and methodology for evaluating your level of risk. That\\\\u2019s why it\\\\u2019s important to get auto insurance quotes from multiple companies. Even if you are already insured with one company, you might want to check rates from competitors once a year to make sure you\\\\u2019re getting the best car insurance for the best rate.Frequently asked questionsAge is one of the many factors that has significance when it comes to car insurance rates. Here are the answers to some common questions surrounding age and car insurance rates.Why is age a factor for car insurance rates?Studies have shown that certain age groups are more prone to being involved in car accidents and filing auto insurance claims. To mitigate potential financial losses, most car insurance companies charge higher premiums for those high-risk age groups.What age group has the most expensive car insurance?Young drivers ages 16 to 24 tend to have the most expensive car insurance. Drivers in this age group are often inexperienced and are more likely to get into car accidents and file insurance claims. As a result, car insurance companies often charge higher premiums to young drivers.Why does car insurance go down after 25?Drivers 25 and older are typically viewed as having better driving skills due to more experience on the road. Speeding tickets, DUIs, or car accidents from earlier years disappear from driving records with time, so drivers over 25 with clean driving records should see an improvement in their average cost of car insurance.What age group has the cheapest car insurance?Experienced and middle-aged drivers in their 30s, 40s, and 50s often have the cheapest car insurance of all age groups. These drivers have more experience on the road and tend to be better drivers. They\\\\u2019re less likely to cause accidents and file insurance claims, so they\\\\u2019re viewed as less risky to insure. However, if drivers in this age range have teenage children or an elderly parent living in their household, their car insurance rates could go up.Is it cheaper for teens to get their own insurance or be on their parents\\\\u2019 policy?While having a teenage driver on a parent\\\\u2019s car insurance policy will cause that policy to be more expensive, it\\\\u2019s still usually less expensive than if that teen were to get insurance on their own. With a combined policy, the family can ideally benefit from the parent\\\\u2019s good driving history, credit score and being in a less risky age group.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Nicole Dow\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 22, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could help\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/when-do-student-loans-resume-203115948.html\",\"Article Content\":\"luplupme via Getty ImagesBorrowers with federal student loans haven\\'t had to make payments or worry about accrued interest since March 2020. On top of that, millions of Americans thought their student loans would be eliminated through President Joe Biden\\'s one-time student loan forgiveness program.However, the Supreme Court struck down Biden\\'s plan, ending the hopes of student loan debt relief for many. Congress also passed a law preventing any federal loan payment freeze extensions, so the payment pause will end in October.The Biden administration acted quickly and announced new measures that could help borrowers struggling with their payments. Taking advantage of these programs could help you reduce your payments, get your loans in good standing, and avoid student loan default.News for borrowers with federal student loansWhen do student loans resume? It\\'s a common question, and the answer has changed several times. Initially, the loan payment freeze on federal student loans was planned to last for only a few months. But then-President Trump \\\\u2014 and later, President Biden \\\\u2014 repeatedly extended the freeze. As a result, many borrowers haven\\'t made payments toward their federal loans in over three years.Now, payments are set to resume. According to the US Department of Education, interest will start to accrue on Sept. 1, 2023, and payments will begin in October 2023.To make student loan repayment more manageable, the Biden administration launched three key initiatives:12-month on-ramp to repayment for federal student loansTypically, borrowers who fail to make on-time payments face steep consequences, including:The negative activity is reported to the credit bureaus and noted on your credit history.The account can be sent to collections.If the loan enters default, the government can garnish your wages.However, the government created a temporary \\\\\"on-ramp\\\\\" period. It gives borrowers 12 months to come up with a plan for managing their loans without worrying about missed or partial payments being reported to the credit bureaus or sent to collections agencies or the loans entering default.Student loan interest will continue to accrue during this time, so paying the minimum required \\\\u2014 or as much as you can afford \\\\u2014 will help you avoid added interest charges. But the on-ramp period gives you time to adjust to student loan payments resuming without the severe consequences that usually come with late or missed payments.Fresh Start program for borrowers in defaultThe Fresh Start program is a new initiative from the Biden administration for borrowers with student loan debt who were in default before the March 13, 2020, payment freeze. Under this program, the government is eliminating the negative impact of student loan default for those borrowers, allowing them to enter repayment like other borrowers so they can start their repayment with a fresh slate.The Fresh Start program will last for one year after the end of the federal payment freeze, and it provides borrowers with the following benefits:Restores access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plansReestablishes eligibility to federal student aid programs like Pell GrantsProtects borrowers from collections activity and negative credit reportingGives borrowers the option of qualifying for student loan rehabilitation if they default later onThe program is not automatic; to take advantage of the Fresh Start initiative, borrowers must take the following steps:Reach out to the loan holder: Borrowers must contact their loan holder and state that they want to take advantage of the program. You can start by\\\\u00a0visiting myeddebt.ed.gov or calling 1-800-621-3115.The government removes your default status: After making arrangements, your loans will be transferred to a non-default loan servicer, and the US Department of Education will remove the default status from the borrower\\\\u2019s credit reports.Sign up for a new payment plan: Once you\\'re out of default, you can sign up for another payment plan. The majority of borrowers sign up for one of the income-driven repayment plans that base their payments on a percentage of their discretionary income and an extended repayment term.Not all borrowers are eligible for the Fresh Start program. Only federal student loan borrowers with the following defaulted loan types will qualify:Direct loans, including Federal Stafford loans, Direct Consolidation loans, and PLUS loans offered via the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program (TEACH Grants converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans are also eligible).Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) loans, including Federal Stafford loans, Federal Consolidation loans, and Federal PLUS loans.Federal Perkins loans held by the US Department of Education.Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Academic Competitiveness Grants, National SMART Grants, and TEACH Grants. (Note: you may have to repay part of a federal grant awarded to you.)Other loans, including private student loans and privately held FFEL or Perkins loans, are ineligible. You can use the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) if you\\\\u2019ve defaulted on your student loan and are unsure of your loan type. If the loan or grant is not one of the program types listed above and is not assigned to the US Department of Education, the information on the NSLDS site does not apply to you.The Fresh Start initiative is a one-time program; you cannot take advantage of it again. And if you default later, the government will report the date of your initial delinquency to the credit bureaus.SAVE repayment planIn 2023, the Biden administration announced the launch of a new IDR plan, the SAVE repayment plan. For low- to middle-income borrowers, the SAVE plan could significantly reduce their payments. It provides several benefits. Some won\\'t go into effect until 2024, but these three perks will begin this summer:It increases the amount of sheltered incomeWith all IDR plans, including the new SAVE plan, your payments are based on a percentage of your discretionary income. Currently, the other IDR plans define discretionary income as the difference between your actual income and 150% of the federal poverty guideline for your family size. But the SAVE plan adjusts the definition of discretionary income to the difference between your income and 225% of the federal poverty guideline.For example, let\\'s say you live in New York, are single, and earn $30,000 per year. The federal poverty guideline for a household of one is $14,580. The current IDR plans use 150% of the poverty guideline to determine your payments, so you would subtract $21,870 from your salary of $30,000 to find your discretionary income. In this scenario, your discretionary income is $8,130. Under the current IDR plans, payments cannot exceed 10% of your discretionary income, so your payments would total $813 per year or $67.75 per month.Under the SAVE plan, discretionary income is defined as the difference between your salary and 225% of the federal poverty guideline. In this scenario, 225% of the federal poverty guideline for your family size is $32,805. Because your income is less than that, you have no discretionary income and would have $0 monthly payments. That means you won\\'t have to pay anything toward your loans, but you won\\'t enter default. And if you still have a balance at the end of your loan term, the remainder is forgiven.The SAVE plan eliminates 100% of unpaid interest on subsidized and unsubsidized loansAs long as you make your payments on time, the government waives unpaid interest, so your loan balance won\\'t grow over time. For example, if your loan accrues $50 per month in interest but your monthly payment is just $30, the government will waive the remaining $20.Spousal income may be excludedWith some IDR plans, your spouse\\'s income is included in the payment calculations, even if you file separate returns. But with SAVE, your spouse\\'s income is excluded if you\\'re married and file separately.What to do to prepare for when student loan repayments resumePayments are set to resume in October. To prepare, follow these steps:Create a budgetIf you haven\\'t made payments toward your loans in years, your finances have likely changed quite a bit. Sit down and create a budget, outlining how much money you have coming in and going out every month. If your budget is too tight, look for areas where you can cut back or consider other repayment options for your student loans.Find your student loan servicerYour loans have likely changed loan servicers since 2020. And if the previous loan servicer didn\\'t have your current address, you may not have received a notification. To find out where your loans are held \\\\u2014 and to set up your payments to avoid late fees \\\\u2014 you can sign in with the Federal Student Aid account dashboard or you can call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-433-3243.Once you know who your servicer is, you can create an online account or contact customer support to change repayment plans or set up your monthly payments.Enroll in the Fresh Start programIf you plan on taking advantage of the Fresh Start program, contact your loan holder at myeddebt.ed.gov or call 1-800-621-3115.Enroll in a new repayment planOn your loan servicer\\\\u2019s account dashboard, you can see what your minimum payment will be when payments resume in October 2023. If your payment under the current repayment plan is too high, you may be able to enroll in a new repayment plan, such as the new SAVE plan, to reduce your payments.You can use the loan simulator tool to determine which plan gives you the lowest payments.Apply for deferment or forbearanceIf you are unable to make payments due to illness or unemployment, you may be able to postpone your payments under a federal forbearance or deferment program. Contact your loan servicer and explain your circumstances to find out what options are available.Sign up for autopaySigning up for automatic payments ensures you never miss a payment, but there is an added benefit: Federal loan servicers will also reduce your interest rate by 0.25%. Over time, that rate reduction can help you save money.Make additional payments (if you can)Not everyone will qualify for low monthly payments under an IDR plan. If you have to make payments under a standard 10-year repayment plan and want to get rid of your debt as quickly as possible, making extra payments is key.For example, let\\'s say you have $15,000 in student loans at 5% interest. With a 10-year repayment term, your monthly payment is $159 per month. If you increased your payments to $179 per month \\\\u2014 adding an extra $20 to your monthly payments \\\\u2014 you would pay off your loans 16 months early and save over $600.Here is how much additional payments would affect your overall loan cost:FAQsWill student loan payments resume?Federal student loans will start accruing interest on Sept. 1, 2023, and your payments will resume in October 2023.Are private student loans eligible for the new repayment plans or the Fresh Start program?No, private student loans aren\\'t eligible for the Fresh Start initiative, SAVE repayment plan, or other federal benefits. If you have trouble affording the payments on a private student loan, contact your lender to see if an alternative payment plan is available.Will I be able to have my student loans forgiven?Although the Supreme Court struck down President Biden\\'s debt relief plan, federal loan borrowers may be eligible for other forms of loan forgiveness. For example, those who work for nonprofit organizations may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and some teachers may qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness. You can view all loan forgiveness and discharge programs on studentaid.gov.How do I apply for the new SAVE repayment plan?The Save Plan doesn\\'t have a separate application yet. However, borrowers can still take advantage of it. If you are currently on the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan, you will automatically be enrolled in SAVE. If you are on a different plan, you can sign up for REPAYE online, and you will be enrolled in SAVE.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kat Tretina\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 21, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/what-the-fed-rate-hike-pause-means-for-bank-accounts-cds-loans-and-credit-cards-183027625.html\",\"Article Content\":\"The Federal Reserve\\'s decision on Sept. 20, 2023, to pause rate hikes will give savers and borrowers a break from rising interest rates \\\\u2014 but lower rates are not on the Fed\\'s radar anytime soon.After 11 rate hikes in 16 months, the central bank appears willing to let interest rates simmer for a while but not rule out further increases in the month ahead.The Fed controls one interest rate: the federal funds rate, which is the short-term rate banks use to borrow from each other. Fed interest rate decisions filter through the financial world, impacting virtually every facet of borrowing costs and saving rates.Interest rate management is monetary medicine the Fed uses to:Slow the economy by raising interest rates in an effort to tame rising costs (high inflation) as measured by the Consumer Price Index.Help mount a recovery when we\\'re at the opposite end of an economic cycle by lowering interest rates as an injection of liquidity into the financial system.Allow past moves to take root while the Fed considers future actions by holding rates steady.What the Fed says is ahead for interest ratesIn a statement issued following the announcement of a pause in rate hikes, the Fed said, \\\\\"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed in recent months but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low.\\\\\"That sounds like good news, but in a monetary policy world, it\\'s not. A strong economy can fuel higher consumer prices and the Fed says \\\\\"inflation remains elevated.\\\\\"Holding interest rates at a high level is an effort to tamp down inflation.\\\\\"Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,\\\\\" the Fed added.Here\\\\u2019s how the Fed\\\\u2019s actions could trickle down to your loans and accounts.How a rate-hike pause affects checking and savings accountsYour short-term liquidity depends on money in the bank. For years, that has meant Americans treading water as cash earned next to nothing. As interest rates have risen, so have deposit account rates. The pause in interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve will likely keep deposit account rates near their current level.Checking accountsChecking accounts that pay interest offer the most meager returns. But you need quick access to the money, and if you manage your cash flow, the bank won\\'t have most of that money in its hands for long.Interest-earning checking accounts paid a national average of 0.04% monthly in September 2022. A year later, that rate had risen to 0.07%. On a scale of \\\\\"not much interest\\\\\" measured in basis points, that\\'s from a smidge to a tad.Let\\'s move up the interest-paid-for-cash scale.Savings accountsShort to mid-term money is best parked in a savings account. It\\'s part of your easy-in, easy-out cash strategy. Last year, in September, the monthly average interest rate on a traditional savings account at a brick-and-mortar bank was 0.17%. In September 2023 it\\\\u2019s 0.45%.High-yield savings accounts pay more \\\\u2014 Yahoo Finance is seeing high-yield savings account APYs of 5% or more. (APY is the result of compounding your interest rate. Compounding periods can vary by bank.) Rates are pushing ever closer to 6% \\\\u2014 a great reason to open an account.Money market accountsA money market account often boosts your return from a common checking account, but you\\'ll likely need to deposit anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 to earn the raise.Last September\\'s national average monthly interest rate was 0.18%. One year later, it\\'s 0.65%. In a decimal world, that\\'s a pretty big jump. And remember, that\\'s an average. Consider putting your second layer of cash in an above-average money market account. It\\'s the money you want close at hand, but not checking-account close.To do that, look for a high-yield money market account. As the Federal Reserve holds interest rates where they are, high-yield money market accounts will remain elevated. Again, Yahoo Finance is seeing high-yield interest rates at and slightly over 5%.What to do now: Shop rates at banks, both brick-and-mortar and online. Keep your near-term cash nimble and earning the best rate it can. Any future Fed rate hike should be a reminder to keep your eye out for improving deposit rates.What Fed policy does for CDsThis year has brought good news for CDs. As the Fed pushed rates up, certificates of deposit earned more.A 12-month CD was earning 0.60% monthly interest in September 2022. A bucket of rate hikes later, the same term CD was paying 1.76%. The best CDs are already topping 5% APY. Your minimum deposit and term will determine your rate.Consider a CD ladder to surf the rising wave of interest rates.What to do now: Use CDs to earn interest on your mid-term money. Staggering maturities, with the ladder strategy mentioned above, will allow you the flexibility to benefit from higher interest rates and access your money without locking it all up for years.What the latest Federal Reserve move will mean for loans and mortgagesNow to the other side of the asset\\\\/liability ledger. Higher interest rates influenced by the Federal Reserve\\'s tightening of the money supply mean you pay lenders more to borrow.Personal loansInterest rates on personal loans have risen from 9.39% at the beginning of the Fed rate hikes in March of 2022 to 11.48% in May 2023. That higher trend is expected to continue until monetary policy officials believe the fight against inflation is won.Student loansWith forbearance ending and payments becoming due again, student loans are rising top-of-mind again for those who still owe. Most federal loans have fixed interest rates, so Fed policy doesn\\'t impact them. Private student loans may have a variable rate, and Fed rate hikes can be a factor.To learn the interest rate on an existing loan, contact your lender or loan servicer.The latest plan from the Biden administration, SAVE IDR, could allow lower payments to those who qualify as the program rolls out. Over 800,000 borrowers are being notified of loan forgiveness related to income-driven repayment plans.Meanwhile, interest rates on new student loans are rising.Home mortgage loansIf you\\'ve been looking to buy a home in the past two years, you know this story. Home loan rates have soared. When the Fed hikes began, lenders were pricing 30-year fixed-rate mortgages around 4%, according to Freddie Mac. After peaking at 7% last October, home loan interest rates eased slightly but have bubbled back up.The Fed doesn\\'t directly influence current mortgage rates, they\\'re a function of lenders tracking financial markets. However, if high inflation continues to ease, it\\'s likely that home loan rates will soon follow. It won\\'t be a diamond run descent. It took nearly 20 years for mortgage loan rates to fall from 7% in 2001 to an annual percentage rate under 3% in 2020. And homebuyers may not see lenders price home loan rates that low again anytime soon. The 50-year average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is well over 7%.What to do now: Carefully consider taking on any additional debt as interest rates remain elevated. If you do initiate a new loan, budget your monthly payment for rates to remain mostly stable. Then if interest rates do head lower and you get a refinancing opportunity, it will be a welcome budget surprise.How Fed rate hikes impact credit cardsWhile the Fed\\'s fight against inflation may be easing the rise in consumer prices, the central bank\\'s past rate increases have impacted your credit card debt, too \\\\u2013 and not in a good way.Credit card interest rates have moved from an average of 16.65% to well over 22% during the Federal Reserve\\'s latest rate-raising cycle. No doubt, those variable APR interest rate charges on credit cards will remain high as long as the monetary policy holds firm.That means minimum payments due won\\'t ease and stiff interest charges on credit card balances will remain unless you pay off your cards each billing cycle.What to do now: Prioritize paying off the credit cards you can \\\\u2014 especially those with the highest interest charges \\\\u2014 and consider balance transfers to lower interest rate and zero-interest credit card offers as your credit score allows. With good credit, a personal loan for credit card debt consolidation may be another option to consider.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Hal Bundrick\",\"Article Date\":\"Wed, Sep 20, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Do I need emergency roadside assistance coverage?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/emergency-roadside-assistance-174215567.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Whether it\\\\u2019s a flat tire or an empty gas tank, being stranded on the side of the road is stressful. And when you\\\\u2019re in an unfamiliar location, having help on speed dial can be a serious relief.When you pay for roadside assistance, you get a dedicated service provider who will ride to the rescue whether a dead battery needs a jump start or a disabled vehicle requires a tow. Let\\\\u2019s take a closer look at what emergency roadside service plans offer drivers and whether this coverage is the right fit for you and your vehicle.What is emergency roadside assistance?Emergency road service is a popular coverage option that helps stranded motorists who are having mechanical issues. Most roadside assistance services offer 24\\\\/7 coverage from a network of local service providers at a reduced cost.A roadside assistance plan can include towing services, help with flat tires, fuel delivery, battery replacement and even locksmith services. Note that what\\\\u2019s covered can vary depending on the location, provider, and several other factors.Emergency road service is designed to minimize the costs of common sources of car malfunction and provide support even in a remote or rural breakdown location.What does emergency roadside assistance cover?Roadside services are designed to save you money in the event your vehicle breaks down, but the benefits included in roadside assistance programs can vary significantly. Here are a few (but not all) of the things you\\\\u2019ll find roadside assistance covers.Towing servicesWhen your car breaks, doing mechanical labor in the breakdown lane isn\\\\u2019t always an option. A roadside assistance program includes towing to the nearest repair facility for free or at a reduced cost. This can also include emergency services and a winch when your vehicle is stuck.Battery servicesGot a dead battery or need a jump start? Roadside assistance services ride to the rescue and replace the battery if needed at a competitive price. Some roadside assistance plans will also test your battery, starter and alternator as well as haul away your old one for free.Tire change servicesIf your road trip has suddenly ground to a halt, roadside assistance plans provide assistance changing a flat tire. Just keep in mind there are some common sense limits to this service such as having your own spare tire on hand.Fuel deliveryYou really thought you\\\\u2019d make it to the gas station, but your fuel tank had other plans. Fuel delivery is often part of roadside assistance coverage but beware that they\\\\u2019ll only top you off enough to make it to the nearest station.Locksmith servicesIf you\\\\u2019re the owner of older vehicles, chances are you\\\\u2019ve locked your keys in the car at least once. Locksmith service can be the key to getting your car rolling again and if they can\\\\u2019t break into your vehicle, they\\\\u2019ll often call you a tow truck.Minor repair and labor coverageIf the problem sidelining you in the breakdown lane is a quick fix like loose wires or low fluids, some roadside services step up to solve the issue. More complicated repairs might not be within your coverage limits.Some roadside programs also cover a few different kinds of vehicles, from motorcycles to boats and RVs. And you can opt for add-on coverage like trip interruption benefits, which would reimburse for the cost of food or lodging if you\\\\u2019re stranded far from home while waiting on a repair shop.Who needs roadside assistance services?Many drivers rack up plenty of mileage (and DIY repairs) without the assistance of an emergency roadside service. But according to I Drive Safely, a defensive driving program, there are some situations where having emergency support is a smart idea.If you own an old car.Did you know according to Car and Driver that the average age of vehicles on the road is 11 years old? A study from AAA indicates any car old enough to sport double digits is twice as likely to end up sidelined on the highway during the next family road trip.If you have a long commute.More mileage equals more chances for things to go wrong with your car. The US Census Bureau indicates the average one-way commute increased to 27.6 minutes in 2019. That puts just over 7,000 miles on your vehicle annually.If you\\\\u2019re worried about your ability to change a tire or make minor repairs.Imagine yourself on the side of a busy highway or on a remote country road after dark. How confident are you in your ability to change a flat tire quickly and safely? Not so confident? Roadside assistance might give you peace of mind.If you\\\\u2019re taking a long road trip.Hitting the highway for an epic road trip gets a lot less fun when you\\\\u2019re stranded or out of gas. Consider roadside assistance coverage for longer trips, especially those to rural or remote areas where finding an auto repair provider in an emergency might be a serious (and expensive) hassle.How much does roadside assistance cost?One of the important considerations before plunking down your money for a roadside assistance plan is the cost. Is roadside service worth it?Let\\\\u2019s take a closer look at what you might pay for common issues with your vehicle if you have roadside coverage versus without it.Keep in mind that additional costs of fuel, tires, and batteries are not included in either estimate. And that in the case of towing without roadside assistance, you\\\\u2019ll pay additional costs per mile on top of the towing fee. Costs can vary for roadside programs as well based on your coverage limits and location.As you can see from the cost comparison, even if you only experience one of these common car problems per year, you\\\\u2019ll save money with emergency road service coverage.5 benefits of having emergency roadside serviceYou\\\\u2019ve heard the cliche: membership has its benefits. Here are a few reasons to lean into the extra costs associated with roadside coverage.1. 24\\\\/7 supportThere\\\\u2019s a certain peace of mind that comes with knowing you\\\\u2019re not alone when you\\\\u2019re stranded at 2 a.m. Roadside assistance programs have folks manning the helm round the clock so that when you call for help, they\\\\u2019ll answer.2. Real-time trackingIn the same way you can track your pizza from the moment it gets popped into the oven until the delivery driver arrives, many roadside assistance mobile apps offer real-time tracking of providers like tow truck drivers.3. Quick and reliable assistanceMany emergency roadside service providers promise help will arrive within a certain time frame (like 30 minutes or less) depending on location. This can be a relief if you\\\\u2019re sitting in your car with the whole family and feeling anxious about getting to your destination.4. Widespread coverageWhile there\\\\u2019s no guarantee your roadside program covers every corner of the map, many of them have contracted providers just a few miles away on major routes and highways.5. Peace of mindWhen you get behind the wheel, you never plan to have a breakdown. But accidents happen and if you\\\\u2019re not equipped to handle minor repairs, it can be a relief to let the professionals handle it.Choosing an emergency road service providerWhen you think of emergency roadside assistance, you likely associate it with being a AAA member. While AAA service is one of the most popular options, there are other ways to request roadside assistance coverage.Below are just a few options to consider, but keep in mind you may already have some limited coverage through your car insurance, credit card or even cell phone provider.American Automobile Association (AAA) MembershipThe long-standing auto club offers three tiers of annual plans: Classic, PlusRV, and Premier. Each AAA roadside assistance plan comes with different towing mileage ranges and other benefits.Good SamGood Sam specializes in roadside assistance for RVs, but they also offer a few different plans for cars, trucks and motorcycles. Their Platinum membership even provides emergency medical assistance.Better World ClubAs a roadside assistance program, Better World Club boasts a 100% carbon neutral program and includes support for bicyclists. You even get 10% off your membership if you\\\\u2019re the owner of a hybrid or electric vehicle.Your insurance providerCar insurance companies commonly offer some basic roadside assistance, but you can also add-on additional coverage to your car insurance policy. Providers like Geico, Progressive, State Farm, National, and AllState all offer emergency roadside service.Auto manufacturerIf you purchased a new car, you\\\\u2019re in luck because they often come with free roadside service for a certain period of time. You can also purchase extended warranties through the car manufacturer or a third-party that offer roadside benefits.Credit card companiesBelieve it or not, a few credit companies like Chase, US Bank, Bank of America, and Capital One offer free roadside assistance as a perk while others have coverage for an annual fee. American Express used to offer this coverage standard with their cards, but it\\\\u2019s no longer available.Cell phone providerBoth Verizon and T-Mobile offer roadside assistance coverage through AllState\\\\u2019s Motor Club at a reduced cost to their customers. For T-Mobile you\\\\u2019ll have to use an app called SyncUP DRIVE to monitor your vehicle, while Verizon provides roadside service as a monthly add-on cost per cell phone line.Rental car companiesMany rental car companies offer some roadside assistance or provide extended coverage for an add-on cost. Be careful before purchasing roadside assistance coverage if you already have it through your car insurance company as this will usually cover your rental car.The cheapest way to get emergency roadside service is usually through your car insurance company, but ask these questions before you add coverage to an existing policy.What\\\\u2019s the plan cost and are there any additional fees?How many service claims can I have per year? Will claims affect my car insurance rates?Am I covered if I\\\\u2019m not in my own car? Does coverage extend to other household members?What are the towing and service limits?Does this roadside assistance policy offer trip interruption benefits?While memberships through auto clubs may be more expensive, they can provide better coverage and more reliable service for members. And if you\\\\u2019re hitting the road without a backup plan, the helping hand will be worth its weight in gold.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kaz Weida\",\"Article Date\":\"Wed, Sep 20, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How does the Fed affect your credit card interest rate?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/how-the-fed-affects-credit-card-interest-rates-125601157.html\",\"Article Content\":\"The Federal Reserve\\\\u2019s interest rate hikes affect many types of debt \\\\u2014 personal loans, home equity, student loans, and more. Credit card balances and the interest rates they carry are no exception.With another federal interest rate decision due, it can be helpful to understand just how the central bank\\\\u2019s movements affect your high-interest card balances. Here\\\\u2019s what to know.How the Fed affects credit card interest ratesThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. It sets monetary policy partially by adjusting the federal funds target rate range. Since March 2022, the Fed has increased this range several times, aiming to bring down high inflation rates.But what does this have to do with your credit cards? The target range set by the Fed doesn\\\\u2019t directly change your credit card APR or annual percentage rate. But it does play a role alongside a third interest rate called the prime rate.Here\\\\u2019s a breakdown of how the process works:Federal funds rate: This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans. The Fed sets a target range for this rate at FOMC meetings.Prime rate: A benchmark rate for lending products offered by banks. The Fed doesn\\\\u2019t directly set the prime rate, but it is based on (and tends to move alongside) the federal funds rate.Credit card interest rates: Lenders determine a variable rate range for credit cards using the prime rate plus and added margin. Your interest rate will fall within this range based on various factors (like credit score) as determined by your credit card issuer.The Fed sets a target federal funds rate range, which banks use to determine their prime rate. Issuers then add percentage points on top of the prime rate to determine your credit card\\\\u2019s rate range.How high your APR ultimately moves within this range is based on several other factors, like your credit score, individual credit history, and other details in your application.Why credit card interest rates are risingAs the Fed rate increases, the prime rate goes up, which means the interest rates on your existing and new credit cards likely will, too. There is an exception: If you lock in an introductory 0% APR on a new card, that offer will remain even if the regular, ongoing APR rises.Credit cards carry variable APRs that change with the prime rate, which is a big reason why Fed interest rate hikes can affect interest even on cards you already have.The central bank has increased its federal funds target rate range by several hundred basis points since March 2022, to more than 5%. In that time, the APRs set by credit card issuers have also increased.These rates were relatively stable between 14%-16% for the past few years, according to Fed data. But since 2022, averages have skyrocketed to more than 20% APR. For accounts that revolve debt balances, the average is even higher: around 22%.How higher interest rates make credit card debt more expensiveInterest rates are higher for all types of lending products \\\\u2014 mortgages, car loans, personal loans, business loans, and so on. On top of that, stubborn inflation means prices for groceries and other essentials are still high. Housing costs are also high, and millions of student loan borrowers will soon add another monthly payment for millions of borrowers.At the same time, Americans are increasing the amount of high-interest credit they owe.In August, credit card debt balances exceeded $1 trillion, according to the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the New York Fed, the highest level the survey has recorded. At the same time, credit card delinquencies are also rising, with more than 5% of card accounts in \\\\u201cserious delinquency\\\\u201d of 90 days or more.What happens to credit card debt when interest rates go up?A higher credit card APR can result in you paying more \\\\u2014 and longer \\\\u2014 toward your debt.Record-high balances coupled with record-high interest rates mean many Americans are already paying more toward their credit cards today. Over time, interest charges can compound quickly as rates rise, leaving cardholders in debt for longer.3 ways you can prepare for Fed rate hikesEven if there is a slowdown of interest rate hikes ahead, it\\'ll be a long while before we\\\\u2019ll see any cuts.\\\\u201cAlthough inflation has moved down from its peak \\\\u2014 a welcome development \\\\u2014 it remains too high,\\\\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in an August speech. \\\\u201cWe are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.\\\\u201dNo matter what the future brings for interest rate changes, there are ways you can reduce the effects of higher APRs on your personal finances.1. Pay more than your minimum paymentMaking more than the minimum payment required each billing cycle can help you pay down balances faster. Pay off your balances in full and on time whenever possible to avoid debt altogether and maintain good credit.2. Consider a balance transfer credit cardIf you already have credit card debt, a 0% APR offer on balance transfers could help you reduce your debt. When you make a balance transfer, you can pay down your existing balances without interest over a period typically lasting around 12-21 months (after paying a balance transfer fee). Your remaining balance will accrue interest at the ongoing variable APR when the offer ends.3. Research 0% APR credit cardsSome credit cards carry intro APRs on both new purchases and balance transfers. If you\\\\u2019re considering opening a new credit card, securing a lower interest rate for several months could help you avoid rising APRs for a while or pay off a larger purchase interest-free over the period.If you\\\\u2019re thinking about applying for a new card with a 0% APR offer, make sure you compare your options before applying. The \\\\u201cbest credit card\\\\u201d for you depends on your individual situation, so it\\\\u2019s important to consider all the details and how the card may fit your longer-term financial goals.Remember: The best way to avoid interest is to pay your balances in full. No matter which card you choose, charging only what you can afford to pay off is the best way to keep rising rates from affecting your wallet.Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

Let\\\\u2019s take a closer look at how much full windshield replacement costs, whether your insurance covers glass damage, and how to make an insurance claim for a cracked windshield.How much does it cost to replace a damaged windshield?If you don\\\\u2019t have comprehensive or collision coverage, you might pay a pretty penny to replace your vehicle\\\\u2019s glass. That\\\\u2019s because advances in motor vehicle technology mean your windshield replacement could require recalibration of expensive safety features.According to the Insurance Journal, the average windshield replacement claim is about $400. However, Kelley Blue Book indicates that on vehicles equipped with wiper sensors or advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as automatic braking, replacing a windshield can cost $1,000 or more.Does car insurance cover windshield damage or replacement?There are several scenarios where auto insurance companies will cover the cost to repair or replace your windshield.Yes, if you have comprehensive and collision coverage.Whether your windshield breaks in an at-fault accident or the glass damage happens as a result of some other kind of accident or vandalism, your car insurance policy\\\\u2019s comprehensive or collision coverage covers windshield replacement.The comprehensive portion of your policy covers glass claims that are the result of things like a broken tree branch or road debris. Broken glass repair costs from car accidents would be covered by collision insurance.Read more: How comprehensive car insurance works and what it coversYes, if someone else damaged your windshield in an at-fault accident.If your windshield was damaged in an accident where the other driver was at fault, their liability insurance should pay for a windshield claim. And if you have underinsured motorist liability coverage, windshield claims should also be covered even if the person at fault doesn\\\\u2019t have proper coverage.Homeowners or renters insurance may also cover windshield claims if the car\\\\u2019s windshield was broken on someone else\\\\u2019s property as result of negligence or an accident such as a batter earning a strike when they send that baseball soaring through your car\\\\u2019s glass.Yes, if you have full glass coverage.Even if you don\\\\u2019t have an auto insurance policy with comprehensive and collision coverage, you can get full auto glass insurance as an add-on insurance product.Getting glass coverage that covers windshield replacement in full may be a good idea if you live in a state that has severe weather or a lot of road debris, drive a vehicle off-road frequently, or your original windshield is 8-10 years old.Windshield repair vs. windshield replacementRepairing a windshield is much less expensive and time-consuming than replacing one. While you\\\\u2019ll pay hundreds to completely replace your vehicle\\\\u2019s windshield, most glass shops offer repair services starting at as little as $20 depending on the extent of the repair and the make and model of your vehicle.How do you know if your cracked or chipped windshield can be repaired versus replaced? The following are a few guidelines used to determine whether that rock chip that turned into a crack is a good candidate for a cheap fix.Each state is a little different, but in general most state laws mandate that your windshield can\\\\u2019t pose a safety risk. For example, in South Carolina windshield cracks are not explicitly mentioned but the law states vehicles cannot be operated if the driver\\'s view is obstructed in any way.Auto glass specialists also emphasize that it\\'s crucial to get cracks and chips fixed as soon as possible to avoid further damage to the windshield. Fortunately, the glass repair process usually only takes about 30 minutes and while you might still see a small blemish on the glass, the structural integrity of the windshield should remain intact.How does a glass deductible for car insurance work?One significant caveat to whether or not you\\\\u2019ll have to pay out of pocket for new vehicle glass is if the windshield claim is subject to a collision or comprehensive deductible. Most insurance companies require you to meet the deductible before they pay out for comprehensive claims for physical damage or a collision claim. Windshield claims are no exception.Read more: What you need to know about car insurance deductiblesWhat does this mean for your wallet? Let\\\\u2019s say you have a $250 insurance deductible and replacing your windshield will cost $450. That means you\\\\u2019d have to pay the first $250 and then your insurance would pay the rest through a comprehensive claim process. However, if your deductible is $500, you\\\\u2019d end up paying the entire cost out of pocket unless you have optional coverage for full glass replacement.There are some states, such as Florida, Kentucky, and South Carolina, where you can get your deductible waived or where having to meet windshield deductibles before coverage kicks in is prohibited. In other states like New York, Connecticut, and Minnesota, you can add windshield insurance coverage that\\\\u2019s not subject to a deductible.If the windshield only needs repair, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners says to contact your insurance agent to see if your coverage waives the comprehensive or collision deductible for glass repairs.How is full auto glass insurance coverage different from comprehensive coverage?Full glass coverage is optional coverage you can add, usually for just a few dollars per month on your insurance premium. Because it\\\\u2019s designed to cover the cost of a windshield replacement or repair, it\\\\u2019s sometimes referred to as windshield insurance or windshield repair insurance.Comprehensive and collision coverage automatically include glass coverage, but you\\\\u2019ll have to meet your deductible before any claims will be paid. The Insurance Information Institute advises that states that don\\\\u2019t automatically include glass coverage in comprehensive insurance coverage will often offer the coverage as an add-on option.Your 6-step guide to filing a claim for windshield replacementGot a crack in your windshield that\\\\u2019s spidering into a web? Explore your options for windshield replacement or repair before the damage gets ahead of you.1. Understand what your insurance coverage includes.Before you rush to file a claim online, understanding what your insurance covers is a good first step. Whether your car insurance will cover a windshield repair or replacement depends on several factors such as if the damage occurred as a result of an accident, your state\\\\u2019s laws and the amount of your deductible.2. Determine \\\\u2014 promptly \\\\u2014 if your vehicle needs windshield replacement or repair.Many of the minor dings and dents windshields pick up as a result of daily driving are simple and inexpensive repairs. But larger cracks and punctures are a different story. And bear in mind that waiting too long to address a problem can end up compromising the structural integrity of the glass or causing a complete collapse of the windshield.3. Make sure your glass claim isn\\'t covered under someone else\\\\u2019s insurance.If the windshield damage occurred as a result of an accident that was determined to be the other driver\\\\u2019s fault, their car insurance should cover repairs such as glass replacement. Glass damage from falling debris or objects that occurred in a driveway might also be covered under a homeowner\\\\u2019s or renter\\\\u2019s insurance policy.4. Call your insurance company to confirm your comprehensive insurance deductible.Once you\\\\u2019ve assessed the extent of the damage and whether or not it\\\\u2019s covered by insurance, you\\\\u2019ll need to determine if filing a claim is actually worth it. Call your insurance company to get a clear idea of what your comprehensive or collision deductible is and how it will be applied toward your windshield repair or replacement.5. Get quotes from auto glass repair shops that work with your auto insurance company.It pays to shop around for quotes for most consumers, and glass repair is no exception. Make sure you know which glass repair shops work directly with your insurance and ask if they offer any discounts for working directly with your insurer on glass claims.6. File a claim or get reimbursed through the glass claim processIf you do plan to use your insurance to cover the cost of a windshield repair or replacement, you\\\\u2019ll have to file a claim or work with a glass shop that will file one for you. Be clear about expectations for out-of-pocket costs and if you choose an out of network provider, contact your insurance company to clarify how you\\\\u2019ll be reimbursed.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kaz Weida\",\"Article Date\":\"Tue, Sep 19, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/is-it-a-good-time-to-buy-a-house-202100449.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Malte Mueller via Getty ImagesWhen the housing market was searing hot, buyers faced intense competition \\\\u2014 bidding wars, cash investors, and buy\\\\/sell decisions made on rapid deadlines. Now that real estate has cooled, there are fewer homes for sale, two-decade-high interest rates, and stubbornly elevated house values.It\\'s rarely easy to buy a home. And if you can find a house you love, the question becomes: Is now a good time to buy?The 2023 housing marketLooking for the perfect time to buy? Fewer than one in five consumers surveyed by Fannie Mae in July 2023 thought that it was a good time to buy a home. Yet, timing the housing market is more complicated than timing the stock market. Which is impossible. There are few \\\\\"just right\\\\\" Goldilocks real estate markets.But you\\'re not buying the market. You\\'re buying a house in a city, neighborhood, and block where you want to live. Hopefully, for quite a while.Mortgage ratesWe all know this story. Interest rates have risen \\\\u2014 and mortgage rates are no exception. The Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates for well over a year in an effort to shrink inflation \\\\u2014 the rise in consumer prices. Not only do the Fed\\'s rate increases immediately lift short-term mortgage rates such as variable-rate loans, but they also tend to influence long-term mortgage rates upwards as well eventually.And though we don\\'t live in a 2%-3% world these days, mortgage rates are near their 52-year historical average.Since April 1971, the 30-year mortgage rate has averaged 7.74%, based on data collected by Freddie Mac.Of course, that\\'s little comfort to homebuyers today who remember when rates were under 3% for much of 2021. Conversely, the highest rate on record was a whopping 18.63% in October 1981.According to Zillow research, the trend of mortgage rates \\\\u2014 whether interest rates are generally rising or falling \\\\u2014 may influence whether existing homeowners would consider selling their existing house to move into another. With so many existing homeowners paying a much lower mortgage rate, the study found it would take rates to fall somewhere to between 4% and 5% before they would sell the home they\\'re in and buy another.This rate gridlock is contributing to the lack of existing homes for sale.Take action: Consider the interest rate strategies below until (and if) mortgage rates fall significantly lower for an opportunity to refinance.Home valuesThere is a little good news, though. Higher mortgage rates have softened the real estate market, and the increase in home prices is moderating.The rise in existing home values is slowing. Home values are lower year-over-year in almost half (23) of the 50 largest metro areas, according to a Zillow analysis.Take action: Look for homes with price reductions where you want to live. Then negotiate even harder.But listings for existing homes are far fewer. For more than 12 months, new listings have been down year-over-year. The number of new listings of homes for sale is down more than 20% from pre-pandemic levels, according to Realtor.com.Take action: Consider expanding your search to more affordable areas close to your favorite neighborhood if it\\'s too pricey.New home inventory is rising. Construction of new homes is showing promise of growth, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. However, builders are still wary of oversupplying the market, concerned that consumer demand could sag as potential buyers shy away from rising mortgage rates.Take action: If you want to buy a house now, consider new construction. You may be able to choose some finishes or make an even better deal on a spec home that\\'s been on the market for a while.When is a good time to buy a house?Buying a home is more than considering macroeconomic factors. It\\'s an important life decision based on your personal and financial situation.Where do you want to be in 5 years?When you rent, the decision to move is broken down into six months, or a year or two at a time, as your lease renews. But every dollar-related detail makes a home purchase a medium- to long-term investment. Buying a house includes various costs: the down payment, closing costs, and financing fees, moving expenses, property taxes, and perhaps selling your existing place.Homeownership requires a years-long timeline. How you make a living, your friends, family, and even community amenities all come into play.Your incomeA primary consideration: your job. Will it require a location change anytime soon, or can you live where you please? Is your income steady and all but assured?Your credit scoreOne of the significant factors that will qualify you for a home loan is your credit score. It\\'s important to know it before applying for a mortgage.For the most common loan, a conventional mortgage not backed by a government agency, you generally need a FICO score of 620 or better.FHA loans can allow a credit score as low as 580 with 3.5% down. VA loans issued to qualified military service members and veterans don\\'t officially have a minimum credit score, though some lenders will require a FICO score of 620.As a benchmark to where you stand, the median credit score on a new mortgage in the second quarter of 2023 was 769, according to the New York Federal Reserve.Of course, minimum scores are the entry-level to qualifying; the higher your score, the better the loan terms you\\'ll be offered. Most importantly, that can mean you\\'ll pay a lower annual percentage rate over the life of the loan. You may also have more room to negotiate on fees.Your current debt loadA primary financial metric lenders will use to determine your creditworthiness is your debt-to-income ratio.Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored entity that provides liquidity to the home loan market, looks for a maximum total DTI ratio of 36% of \\\\\"the borrower\\\\u2019s stable monthly income.\\\\\" Exceptions can allow for total DTIs up to 50%, but it\\'s usually best to avoid working on the edges of qualification if you can.You can calculate your DTI by dividing your total recurring monthly debt by your gross (before taxes and other deductions) monthly income.Include debt such as monthly mortgage payments (or rent), real estate taxes, and homeowner\\'s insurance. Also, add any car payments, student loans, and the monthly minimum due on credit cards. Remember any personal loan payments and child support or alimony.Do not include debt such as monthly utilities \\\\u2014 like electricity, water, garbage, or gas bills \\\\u2014 or car insurance, television streaming subscriptions, or cell phone bills. You can also exclude health insurance costs and miscellaneous expenses such as groceries or entertainment.Your savingsHaving a cash cushion in the form of emergency savings shows lenders that you are prepared for the unexpected. Of course, that savings account should also include \\\\u2026Your down paymentA large chunk of your savings account should be dedicated to the down payment. A minimum of 3% down is required in order to qualify for a conventional loan targeted to first-time homebuyers \\\\u2014 or ideally, 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance. Yes, zero-down options exist if you are eligible for a VA- or USDA-backed loan.According to Realtor.com, the average down payment in the first quarter of 2023 was 13%.4 rate-relief strategies to considerBuying a house when interest rates are high can require some financial finesse to enhance affordability.1. Buying discount pointsPrepaying interest in order to lower your ongoing mortgage rate is called buying discount points. One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. However, lenders sometimes add a point or two to a mortgage proposal to make their loan offer appear more enticing. But you\\'re actually paying for the discount with an upfront fee.When shopping for a loan, compare loan offers with zero points. Then, you can decide whether to buy points to lower your interest rate. It is important to note that buying one point (paying 1% of the loan amount upfront) will generally reduce your interest rate by only one-quarter of a percentage point.2. An interest rate buydownBorrowers can lower their mortgage interest rate for the first few years at the beginning of the loan term with a buydown. Home builders, sellers, and some lenders sometimes offer an interest rate buydown to boost sales.While you get a short-term break on the interest rate, your payments and total interest may actually be higher. It\\'s a strategy that requires running the numbers on the long-term benefits.If you\\'re paying for the buydown, compare a mortgage both with and without a buydown. By the way, lenders will qualify you based on the permanent interest rate, not the temporary buydown rate.3. An adjustable-rate mortgageA mortgage product that increases in popularity whenever rates begin to rise is back: the adjustable-rate mortgage.ARMs have a fixed interest rate for an introductory period, often five to 10 years, and then the rate changes regularly, usually once or twice a year. Tips when shopping for an ARM:Look for an introductory rate that is lower than a fixed-rate mortgage.Choose a term you feel comfortable with, perhaps in line with how long you plan to stay in the home.Make sure you budget for possible increases in your monthly payment if the interest rate moves higher after the end of the introductory rate period.4. A shorter-term mortgageAre you more comfortable with an interest rate that never changes, even if your monthly payment is slightly higher than you\\'d like? Consider a shorter-term loan. Mortgages with 20- or 15-year fixed terms, as opposed to the traditional 30-year term, typically come with lower interest rates. The lower rate and shorter term combination means you\\'ll gain equity in your home faster, too.Your next moveBuy smart and shop a lot. Relentlessly shop mortgage rates and lenders for the best loan offers and justified fees. Get a written preapproval from your lender, then shop for a house you can love and can afford. Your home buying competition is.According to Zillow, when it comes to first-time buyers versus repeat buyers, first-timers are more likely to reach out to at least three lenders and three real estate agents.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Hal Bundrick\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 28, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Are electric cars more expensive to insure?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/ev-insurance-153443980.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Whether you\\\\u2019re considering an electric car for the cutting-edge technology, the fuel cost savings or the environmental benefits, it\\\\u2019s important to understand the specifics about EV insurance.Despite their higher cost, there are more electric vehicles on the road than ever. Insurance companies, in turn, have responded with customized offerings.Here\\\\u2019s what you need to know about how an EV auto insurance policy differs from traditional car insurance coverage \\\\u2013 and what cost differences you should expect.Insurance for electric vehicles: special considerationsYou won\\\\u2019t be required to purchase a special electric vehicle auto insurance policy just because you drive an EV. Car insurance coverage is the same whether you have a gas-powered car or electric car, and there isn\\'t any special policy you are mandated to buy outside of your state\\\\u2019s minimum required auto insurance coverage.Depending on the coverage options you choose and even where you live, EV auto policies will include some combination of:Liability coverage, including property damage liability and bodily injury liability coverage, that pays out for others harmed in an accident you cause.Collision coverage, to repair or replace your vehicle if you\\\\u2019re involved in an accident where someone else isn\\\\u2019t the at-fault driver.Comprehensive coverage for other-than-collision damage, such as vandalism, theft or weather-related events.Uninsured motorist\\\\/underinsured motorist, in case you\\\\u2019re hit by another driver who doesn\\\\u2019t have auto insurance or whose limits aren\\\\u2019t enough to cover your losses.Personal injury protection (PIP), to cover your medical bills and other expenses from an accident like lost wages or home health care.Medical payments (Medpay) coverage, to help with things like co-pays, medical deductibles, prescriptions, and procedures following an accident.Select EV drivers have the option of specialized EV auto insurance policies. This is especially true for drivers of certain Tesla models in select states, who can purchase coverage directly through the manufacturer. This Tesla auto insurance offers many of the same coverage options mentioned above in addition to gap insurance\\\\/auto loan protection in some areas.In the future, carriers may begin offering EV auto insurance policies that also protect the vehicle\\\\u2019s high voltage battery, at-home charging stations, and other charging equipment and parts that aren\\\\u2019t covered by typical policies.Electric car insurance costs (Hint: They\\\\u2019re higher)While not always the case, you can usually count on EV insurance premiums being higher than those for conventional, gas-powered vehicles. The actual cost of your coverage will depend on your driving record, age, gender, location, credit history, coverage options, and the vehicle you drive.There are also some special considerations and features of EVs that can impact your car insurance rates. Here are a few to keep in mind:Electric vehicles tend to have newer and more updated technology, which can be costly to replace and difficult to source.While the purchase cost of EVs has been gradually declining, these vehicles are still more expensive on average than comparable gas-powered vehicles. Because of the higher cost of replacement, carriers may charge more for full coverage, including comprehensive and collision coverage.If your EV is involved in an accident, the high-voltage battery, which powers the electric motor, could be damaged and need replacing. Depending on your vehicle, battery-pack replacement can cost tens of thousands of dollars.Parts for certain EVs may be limited due to small manufacturing processes. This can make the repair process notably more expensive and result in long delays.Not all repair shops are equipped to work on EVs, so your vehicle may need to go to a special shop following an accident. This can be more costly for your insurance company.What about hybrid vehicles?If you own a hybrid vehicle, you\\\\u2019ll encounter some of the same issues with auto insurance rates as EV owners. Hybrid cars have a high-voltage battery that maintains the charge on the vehicles\\\\u2019 electric motors. Repair and replacement can be expensive, and that cost is reflected in the policyholders\\\\u2019 premiums.On the other hand, hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius are self-charging, so you won\\\\u2019t need to worry about installing a charger at your home.Tips for insuring your electric vehicleWhen shopping around for a car insurance policy for your electric vehicle, keep these things in mind to get the right coverage and snag the right price:Research and compare car insurance companies that specialize in EV coverage; these carriers may have the best network of appraisers, parts suppliers, and body shops if and when you need repair. Some offer EV-related discounts that will save you money. For example, Farmers offers a discount to customers in California who drive electric or hybrid vehicles.When comparing carriers, ask whether the policy covers battery replacement, home charging stations or loss of use coverage, and if other additional coverages are available. While this isn\\\\u2019t common yet, you may find a carrier that covers accessories and auxiliary costs involved with your electric vehicle.Be sure to take advantage of rebates, tax credits, discounts, and incentives offered to EV drivers. These might include extra savings for vehicles with autonomous\\\\/self-driving or special security features.Request car insurance quotes from multiple carriers \\\\u2014 including your renters or homeowners insurance provider.

But with more banks offering high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs), money market accounts may not be as advantageous as they were before.When it comes to money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts, there are key differences in terms of yields, minimum deposits, and fees.What is a Money Market Account?Money market accounts, a type of deposit account you can use to grow your savings, are commonly offered by banks and credit unions. They are an account you can use to save for an emergency, a dream vacation, or a down payment on a home.Money market accounts can be appealing because they typically provide higher annual percentage yields (APYs) than savings accounts. As of this writing, the average rate for a traditional savings account was just 0.39%. For a money market account, the average rate was 0.57%.Money market accounts also are more accessible than a traditional savings account; you can withdraw money by writing a check or you can use a debit card to withdraw money at an ATM. However, money market accounts often restrict the number of withdrawals or transfers you can do each month. Depending on your financial institution\\'s policies, you may incur excessive use or withdrawal limit fees if you exceed six in a month.These accounts are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), so your deposits are protected up to a maximum of $250,000. When you\\\\u2019re worried about safety, knowing that your money market account is secure can give you peace of mind.What is an HYSA?A high-yield savings account is a type of savings account that offers significantly higher APYs than the national average. They\\\\u2019re usually available from online banks; because they don\\\\u2019t have brick-and-mortar locations, they have less overhead costs and can provide higher rates to attract customers.Depending on the bank or credit union, APYs on HYSAs can be as high as 5% or more \\\\u2014 significantly higher than the national average for traditional savings accounts.Like money market accounts, HYSAs are usually backed by FDIC or NCUA insurance. And HYSA customers may also have to abide by the six-per-month withdrawal limit. Exceeding that limit could cause your account to be transferred to a checking account, or you may have to pay excessive use or withdrawal fees.Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Key differencesMoney market accounts and HYSAs are tools you can use to grow your savings. They\\\\u2019re secure accounts backed by the FDIC or NCUA and they both provide higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts do differ in several significant ways:APYs: It\\\\u2019s possible to find HYSAs with higher APYs than money market accounts offer.Minimum deposits: You often need hundreds or even thousands of dollars to open an account with a money market account. But with an HYSA, you can typically open an account with a $0 minimum deposit requirement.Balance requirement: Although some money market accounts have low minimum deposit requirements, you usually must maintain a much higher balance to earn the highest-possible APY. For example, you may need to maintain a balance of $25,000 or more to earn the best rate. By contrast, HYSAs don\\\\u2019t usually have tiered rates \\\\u2013 the same high rate applies to everyone, regardless of their balance.Monthly fees: A HYSA usually has low fees or the bank or credit union may charge no fees at all. But money market accounts usually involve monthly account maintenance fees, which can cost as much as $25 per month.Accessibility: When it comes to accessibility, money market accounts tend to have an edge over HYSAs. Money market accounts allow you to withdraw money with a check or debit card, while HYSAs are more limited. Unless the bank behind the HYSA operates branches and teller services, you can only make electronic funds transfers.Pros and cons of money market accounts vs. HYSAsWhich account is better for you: a money market account or an HYSA? Each account has its advantages and drawbacks:Pros of money market accountsThey have higher APYs than traditional savings accounts: Money market account APYs are typically higher than the APY you\\\\u2019d get with a traditional savings account opened at a local bank or credit union.Money market accounts provide easy access to cash: Money market accounts give you check-writing privileges and access to a debit card, making it easy to withdraw money.Money market accounts are liquid: Unlike some other options, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts are liquid, meaning you can access your money \\\\u2014 without penalty \\\\u2014 whenever you want.Cons of money market accountsThey usually have higher minimum deposit requirements than savings accounts: Although the minimum deposit requirements vary by bank or credit union, money market accounts often require you to have hundreds or even thousands to open an account. The minimum deposit requirement can be a significant hurdle for those just starting out or those that are new to saving money.You\\\\u2019re limited in how many withdrawals you can make: Although it\\\\u2019s easier to access your money with a money market account, you are limited in how many withdrawals or transfers you can make per month. If you exceed that limit, the bank can charge you hefty fees per every excess transaction.They often have higher fees: Money market accounts usually charge monthly account fees, and the fees can range from $5 to $25 per month.Pros of HYSAsHYSAs provide higher-than-average APYs: HYSAs provide APYs that are much higher than the national average for traditional savings or money market accounts.They have low minimum deposit requirements: HYSAs usually have low deposit requirements, so you can open an account with as little as $0.Usually, HYSAs have no monthly fees: Because HYSAs are often provided by online banks with low operating costs, they don\\\\u2019t usually have monthly fees.Cons of HYSAsThe APY can change: With some financial products, such as CDs, you can lock in the APY for a specific period, such as 12 to 48 months. But with an HYSA, the rate can change along with market conditions, so the rate could decline.They\\\\u2019re harder to access: With an HYSA, the only way to access your money is to transfer it to another account. You can\\\\u2019t make withdrawals with a check or debit card.You can\\\\u2019t visit a branch: HYSAs are usually offered by online banks, so there aren\\\\u2019t local branches you can visit. When you need in-person help, that can be a frustrating problem.Money market accounts vs. HYSAs: Which account is right for you?High-yield savings account vs. money market: Which is better? There\\\\u2019s no right answer that applies to everyone. Which account type makes the most sense depends on your financial goals, how much money you have available to open a new account, and how much cash you intend to leave in the account.For those that don\\\\u2019t have a lot of money on hand or those that don\\\\u2019t want to worry about monthly fees, an HYSA is likely the better choice. HYSAs provide higher-than-average APYs, and they usually have no minimum deposit requirements, nor do they charge monthly fees.For those that have substantial amounts of money available, a money market account may be a wiser choice than a savings account. If you deposit a large amount \\\\u2014 such as $25,000 or more \\\\u2014 and maintain that balance, you can earn a much higher APY. Plus, you can easily access that money with a check or debit card when you need to tap into your savings.Regardless of which account you choose, do some research before opening an account. APYs, minimum deposits, and fees vary between financial institutions, so compare several options to find the best APY at the lowest cost.Find the best Money Market Account rates!\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kat Tretina\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 15, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Student loan issues?

Loans resumed accruing interest on September 1, 2023, and borrowers are expected to make their first payments on October 1, 2023.Many borrowers may notice changes in their balances, payment plans, and even their student loan servicer as they prepare for repayment. In fact, more than four-in-ten borrowers will return to repayment with a new student loan servicer, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board.Throughout the course of the moratorium, three major student loan providers \\\\u2014 Navient, Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), and Granite State Management and Resources transferred their debts to other service providers and are no longer serving borrowers.This change impacted millions of borrowers and could make repayment more confusing for borrowers who aren\\\\u2019t sure who to contact regarding their student loans and may even spot inaccuracies or incorrect information due to these mass transfers.Common student loan errors and how to fix themThere are several common errors student loan borrowers may encounter throughout repayment. As you enter into repayment, you should be sure to keep a close eye out for any errors that are inaccurate and could set back your repayment timeline or ding your credit score.Common errors include:Discrepancies in your loan balances or interest ratesMissing payments in your payment historyIncorrect payment status reported to the credit bureausChanges in your payment due datesThe good news is that there are ways to dispute these errors.

Generally, federal loans have lower interest rates and added borrower protections than other financing options. But federal PLUS Loans are very different from other federal student loans.As of the end of 2023, 5.4 million borrowers have outstanding PLUS Loans, owing a combined $212.5 billion. Although PLUS Loans are common, they have higher rates and fees than other federal student loans. Before applying for a federal PLUS Loan, learn about their rates, terms, and repayment options.What are PLUS Loans?A federal Direct PLUS Loan is one of the four types of federal student loans that the Department of Education issues:Direct Subsidized: For undergraduate students onlyDirect Unsubsidized: For undergraduate and graduate studentsDirect PLUS: For graduate and professional students and for parents borrowing on behalf of a childDirect Consolidation: For borrowers with existing federal student loansHowever, PLUS Loans are split into two categories, serving different groups: Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS.Grad PLUSGrad PLUS Loans are specifically for graduate or professional students, such as those pursuing a master of business administration (MBA) or attending medical school. Students must be enrolled at least half-time at an eligible school, and their program must lead to a graduate or professional degree or certificate.Parent PLUSWhile Grad PLUS Loans are only for graduate-level students, Parent PLUS Loans are for parents of undergraduate students. The parent will take out a loan in their own name to pay for their child\\'s education, and the parent is the only person legally obligated for the loan\\'s repayment; the child has no obligation to repay the loan.Parent PLUS Loans are limited to biological or adoptive parents. Other relatives, including legal guardians, are not eligible.Federal Direct Loans vs. federal PLUS Loans: What\\'s the difference?In the past, several forms of federal loans were available, including Federal Family Education Loans and Perkins Loans. However, those programs ended. Currently, the Department of Education only issues loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program.PLUS Loans are part of the federal Direct Loan program, but they function quite differently from the other Direct loans. There are five key differences:1. Rates and feesFederal student loans tend to have lower rates than other forms of education loans. As of the 2023-2024 academic year, Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans for undergraduate students are at 5.50%, and they have a disbursement fee of 1.057% of the loan amount.PLUS Loans tend to be significantly more expensive; Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS have the highest rates of any federal loan. The current rate is 8.05%, and the disbursement fee is 4.228% of the loan amount.2. Grace periodsMost federal loans have a built-in six-month grace period; the student has six months after they graduate or leave school before payments are due. In the case of Direct Subsidized loans, the government covers the interest that accrues while you\\'re in school and during the grace period.That\\'s not the case with PLUS Loans. With Grad PLUS Loans, the loan is automatically deferred while the student is in school, but interest accrues and is capitalized when the student enters repayment.Parent PLUS Loans don\\'t have a grace period. Parents can opt to defer repayment until after the child graduates. However, interest will accrue while the student is in college and will be capitalized when the loan enters repayment.3. Borrowing limitsFederal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans have strict annual and aggregate borrowing caps. Depending on the student\\'s dependency status, year, and loan type, the annual limit ranges from $3,500 to $20,500, and the aggregate limit ranges from $23,000 to $138,500.By contrast, PLUS Loans have no annual or aggregate maximums. Parents and students can borrow up to the total cost of attendance.4. EligibilityUnlike other types of loans, federal student loans have no minimum income or credit score requirements. And in the case of Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, there is no credit check at all.PLUS Loans are the only federal loans that do require a credit check. However, a low credit score or a few missed payments aren\\'t enough to cause you to be rejected for a loan. The Department of Education looks for an adverse credit history, which means your credit report shows one of the following issues:One or more accounts with a combined outstanding balance of $2,085 that are 90 or days delinquent, placed in collections or charged off within the past two yearsDuring the past five years, you have been subject to one of the following:Default determinationDischarge of debt in bankruptcyForeclosureRepossessionTax lienWage garnishmentWrite-off of federal student aidIf you have an adverse credit history, you may qualify for a PLUS Loan by adding an endorser \\\\u2014 a friend or relative with good credit \\\\u2014 that guarantees the loan.5. Repayment optionsWith federal Direct Loans, the standard repayment plan for all loans is 10 years. However, Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans are eligible for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can significantly reduce the borrower\\'s payments. Borrowers can also opt for a graduated or extended repayment plan, allowing them to extend their payments for up to 25 years.Grad PLUS Loans are eligible for all federal repayment plans, including all of the income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. However, Parent PLUS Loans are more restrictive.In their existing state, Parent PLUS Loans aren\\'t eligible for IDR plans, nor can borrowers qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). However, there is a workaround. Borrowers with Parent PLUS Loans can consolidate with a Direct Consolidation Loan. Once the loan is consolidated, they are eligible for one of the IDR plans \\\\u2014 income-contingent repayment \\\\u2014 and can work toward PSLF.How to apply for PLUS LoansThe application process for PLUS Loans works differently than for other federal loans. With federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, the borrower completes the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and they are automatically considered for federal loans. With PLUS Loans, the borrower needs to specifically request them.Borrowers intending to apply for PLUS Loans have to complete the FAFSA, but they also must submit a separate PLUS Loan application. The FAFSA must be submitted before you can apply for a PLUS Loan.You can usually apply for a PLUS Loan online, but check with the selected college\\'s financial aid office first; some schools have different procedures for PLUS Loans.Alternatives to PLUS LoansAlthough PLUS Loans can be useful tools for financing education expenses, they are the most expensive form of federal loans, with the highest rates and fees. And because they have no caps on how much you can borrow, you can easily end up taking on more debt than you can afford. It\\'s important to consider how PLUS Loans will fit into your budget and borrow the least amount possible.Additionally, Parent PLUS Loans are limited to biological and adoptive parents; other relatives or carers are ineligible, so if you need financing \\\\u2014 or want to save money \\\\u2014 consider these other options.Grants and scholarshipsThere are billions of dollars available to college and graduate students in the form of grants and scholarships. And unlike student loans, they don\\'t have to be repaid. These awards can come from colleges, nonprofit organizations, private companies, and even generous individuals. Use the BigFuture Scholarship Search tool to find available opportunities.Work-study programsFederal work-study programs are frequently overlooked, but they can help cover some of your added expenses, including textbooks or supplies. With a work-study program, you work part-time \\\\u2014 either on-campus or off for a local employer \\\\u2014 and earn money to put toward your education. On average, students earn about $1,800 per year from work-study programs.Private student loansPrivate student loans are available to both graduate students and parents.If you are not the adoptive or biological parent and want to help the child pay for school, private student loans can be useful alternatives. They also can be a good option if you have excellent credit; depending on your creditworthiness, you may qualify for a loan with a lower rate than you\\'d get with a PLUS Loan.Private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates, and lenders typically don\\'t charge disbursement fees. However, they don\\'t have the repayment benefits or perks of federal student loans, so you won\\'t qualify for IDR plans or loan forgiveness, so private loans tend to be best used as a last resort after exhausting other aid.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kat Tretina\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 15, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is rental car reimbursement and what does it cover?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/rental-car-reimbursement-175331598.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Managing the aftermath of a car accident can be a stressful process. It doesn\\\\u2019t end when you drop your damaged car at the repair shop. While minor repairs from a fender bender can take one to three days, vehicle damage from a major collision can take three weeks or longer to repair.Whether your ride is in the shop for a few days or a few weeks, you\\\\u2019ll still need a vehicle to get around. That\\'s when rental reimbursement as part of a car insurance policy has you covered.What is rental reimbursement coverage?Rental reimbursement coverage is optional coverage you can add to your auto insurance policy that reimburses or pays upfront for the cost of a rental car if your vehicle is damaged in a covered claim. It\\\\u2019s relatively affordable, usually less than $200 a year. In order to add rental reimbursement to your auto policy, the car insurance company typically requires the vehicle to carry full comprehensive and collision coverage.Rental car coverage is subject to specific policy limits like a set dollar amount and time frame when rental reimbursement costs would be covered. For instance, Allstate rental reimbursement pays rental expenses up to $30 per day for 30 days or until your car is back on the road. Any additional rental car costs over the daily limit would be your responsibility.It\\\\u2019s important to note that rental reimbursement coverage isn\\\\u2019t just to defer the cost of a rental vehicle. Often, rental reimbursement includes other transportation expense coverage such as public transportation fares, Uber or Lyft service, or even taxi rides.Rental reimbursement coverage vs. rental insuranceWhile the two terms sound similar, rental reimbursement coverage and rental car insurance are not the same.Rental reimbursement is not included in standard collision or comprehensive coverage but can be added onto auto insurance policies for a low cost. This coverage means insurance will pay the costs of securing a rental in the event of necessary car repairs after a covered accident.Rental car insurance is what rental car companies ask you to add as extra coverage in case your rental car breaks or is involved in an accident. Typically, your insurance covers you while driving a rental car, but you may want more coverage if you don\\\\u2019t carry full comprehensive and collision coverage.How does rental reimbursement insurance work?If you have rental reimbursement as part of your collision coverage and have an at-fault accident, your insurance will cover some costs of a rental or alternative transportation for a covered event.In some cases your auto insurance company directly pays the rental car company, especially if it\\\\u2019s a trusted or in-network partner. In other cases, you\\\\u2019d have to pay the daily rate on the rental and then be reimbursed through the claims process.Read more: How to file a car insurance claimHowever, you may be able to take advantage of rental reimbursement even if you don\\\\u2019t carry full coverage. In a situation where the other driver has been determined to be at fault, their insurance would reimburse costs associated with a covered loss, including the cost of your rental car.In both scenarios, you shouldn\\\\u2019t have to pay a deductible, but there may be a per claim limit to this coverage. That\\\\u2019s why you should always consult with an auto insurance agent or your policy prior to renting for an extended period.It\\\\u2019s also worth mentioning that rental reimbursement won\\\\u2019t usually cover a rental for routine maintenance or other repairs not associated with an accident.What rental costs does the car insurance company cover?Rental reimbursement coverage has its limits. Most states allow you to rent a similar car to the one covered under the policy, but the limits for reimbursement are fixed.What does that mean in practical terms? Let\\\\u2019s say you\\\\u2019ve been in a covered accident and you have rental reimbursement. Your insurance company limits coverage to $40 per day or $1,200 per claim.Your SUV is going to be in the shop for at least a month, so you rent a similar one for $50 per day. Your insurance pays the rental company $40 per day and you\\\\u2019re billed for the remainder of the balance. Once the rental bill rolls hits $1,200 claim limit, any additional rental costs are your responsibility.Are there rental car costs insurance won\\\\u2019t cover under rental reimbursement?Keep in mind that even if you have rental reimbursement or travel expense reimbursement for a covered accident or theft, the following usually aren\\\\u2019t part of your coverage:cost of gasmileagesecurity depositadditional rental car insuranceYou\\\\u2019ll also need to make sure the accident or the repairs needed are due to a covered event. For instance, if your car has engine failure, that\\\\u2019s usually covered under a warranty from the car\\\\u2019s manufacturer or the dealership and wouldn\\\\u2019t be eligible for any policy benefits from collision or comprehensive coverage.How much does rental car reimbursement cost?Part of determining how much coverage you need and if it\\\\u2019s worth it involves assessing the financial trade-off. How much does adding rental reimbursement coverage to your auto insurance cost versus the cost of renting a car?The average cost of renting a car varies depending on the vehicle, rental company, and location. You\\\\u2019ll pay around $81 per day according to a 2022 analysis of rental car costs across the country, although that figure goes up substantially in some urban areas.Meanwhile adding rental reimbursement coverage averages around $100-$200 a year depending on the daily limits and coverage you choose. Using back-of-the-napkin math, you\\\\u2019ll pay roughly the equivalent of two days\\\\u2019 car rental fee for a year\\\\u2019s worth of rental reimbursement coverage.Can I add rental car reimbursement coverage after an accident?Unfortunately, adding rental reimbursement after an accident won\\\\u2019t help you with your current rental car costs. But it could help avoid financial fallout if you have a covered event in the future.If the other driver was at fault, their property damage liability coverage should cover your rental car until your damaged car can be repaired, replaced or you are reimbursed for its value. If fault has not been determined, you\\\\u2019ll have to rely on your own rental reimbursement coverage or pay out of pocket and get reimbursed later.Read more: What is liability car insurance and how much do you need?5 reasons rental reimbursement might be worth itRental reimbursement is optional, but there are several reasons experts advise adding this coverage to auto insurance policies for most drivers.1. Rental reimbursement is relatively inexpensive.In terms of value, rental reimbursement offers quite a lot of coverage for a relatively low cost. An Enterprise Rental Reimbursement Study with Qualtrics concluded that even though 59% of eligible policyholders don\\\\u2019t have rental reimbursement coverage, half of those policyholders still rented a car after filing a claim.2. Rental car coverage provides consistency during a difficult time.Enterprise Rent-A-Car data indicates the average rental period after an accident is about two weeks. In the wake of an accident, the last thing you need is worry about how you\\\\u2019ll get back to your daily routine. Rental car reimbursement steps into the breach to reduce stress and minimize disruption during the claims process. Plus having your own vehicle is a huge help if you have to begin shopping for a new (or used) car.3. You can adjust coverage to meet your needs.Rental reimbursement isn\\\\u2019t a one-size-fits-all coverage option. Most insurance companies provide options to increase daily limits, so you can adjust your out-of-pocket expenses depending on the rental car market you live in, the size of vehicle you\\\\u2019ll need and more.4. Rental reimbursement covers other transportation costs.Renting a car isn\\\\u2019t your only option with rental reimbursement coverage. Rental reimbursement coverage typically pays $30 or $40 a day. That can go a long way toward covering public transportation or rideshare costs until you get your wheels back.5. Multiple risk factors increase your likelihood of being in a car accident.While the average driver doesn\\\\u2019t get in an accident every year, the National Safety Council says certain risk factors like driving during rush hour can affect your likelihood of being involved in an incident. Living in certain states like South Carolina or Massachusetts also increases your risk, where as many as 12% of drivers have an at-fault accident on their record.If you\\\\u2019ve been considering rental reimbursement, talk to your auto insurance agent to find out what kind of insurance coverage is available. Even if you only have an accident once every few years, rental reimbursement can go a long way toward making a stressful situation a little easier.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kaz Weida\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 14, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Car insurance costs for married vs. single drivers\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/car-insurance-married-vs-single-164635100.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Your financial life can change significantly when you get married. You might save money by splitting household expenses and filing taxes jointly. What\\\\u2019s more, your marital status can influence how much you pay for car insurance.When auto insurance underwriters calculate your car insurance premiums, they don\\\\u2019t solely look at your driving history, car model, and where you live. You might also be asked about your marital status \\\\u2014 you can even save money on your car insurance by being married vs. single.Car insurance rates for married and unmarried driversAccording to a research report from the Consumer Federation of America, married car insurance policyholders tend to have lower insurance premiums than their single counterparts. While differences in premium costs varied among insurers, some single policyholders were found to be paying up to 34% more than married drivers.One reason for the rate differences may be that married people are perceived as more responsible drivers \\\\u2013 although the study also alludes to income differences between married couples and single individuals as playing a role.The Insurance Information Institute states that insurers have long used factors outside of a motorist\\\\u2019s driving record \\\\u2013 such as age, credit history, and marital status \\\\u2013 as determinants in setting car insurance rates because such rating factors have been proven to predict the likelihood of the policyholder filing auto insurance claims.Because an insurance company\\\\u2019s business relies on collecting more money in premiums than it pays out for claims, your insurer will probably charge you higher rates if it perceives you as more likely to file costly claims. Likewise, you can score a lower rate if your insurance company views you as less likely to file claims.It\\\\u2019s important to know that if you live in a state that has banned insurance companies from using marital status in setting insurance rates \\\\u2013 such as Massachusetts and Michigan \\\\u2013 your car insurance cost will not be specifically impacted by whether you\\\\u2019re married or single. But there are other ways in which your marital status can indirectly affect your insurance premiums.Benefits of being married when purchasing auto insuranceThe fact that married couples are viewed as less risky to insure is not the only reason they tend to benefit from lower premiums compared to their single counterparts. Married couples often benefit from other car insurance discounts that don\\\\u2019t apply as often for single people.Many major car insurance companies \\\\u2013 such as Allstate, Geico, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide, State Farm, and USAA \\\\u2013 offer multi-car or multi-policy discounts. Essentially, they reward customers for having more than one vehicle under their coverage or for purchasing homeowners\\\\u2019 insurance, life insurance, or another insurance policy in addition to their auto insurance.Statistically, married couples have a higher probability of owning more than one car, being homeowners, and having life insurance compared to single individuals.Married people also tend to have higher credit scores than single people. Auto insurance companies often analyze credit status when determining car insurance rates, because studies have shown that people with excellent credit tend to file fewer claims than those with poor credit.So while there may not be a specific \\\\u201cmarriage discount\\\\u201d for car insurance, married couples tend to benefit from lower rates in indirect ways.Disadvantages for married couples on the same policyWhile there are clear benefits to being married vs. single when it comes to auto insurance rates, there can be some disadvantages for couples who plan to be on the same policy.If your partner has a poor driving record with a history of claims, it could increase the cost of your auto insurance even if you have a good driving record. Also, if your spouse has poor credit, insurance providers may deem you as more risky to insure and saddle you with higher insurance premiums.If your partner\\\\u2019s driving history or credit is likely to increase your premium, you might consider maintaining separate policies \\\\u2013 either with the same insurance company or different companies. Get car insurance quotes from multiple providers to compare the costs of keeping your policies together or separate.Your insurance company may require that you list your spouse on your policy \\\\u2013 assuming you share a household and are both licensed drivers. However, you can request a named-driver exclusion if you don\\\\u2019t want your spouse included on your policy. Just know that if your spouse drives your vehicle and gets in an accident after being excluded from your policy, your insurance company won\\\\u2019t cover any claims.How do car insurance benefits apply to unmarried couples?If you\\\\u2019re not married but living with your significant other, you might be able to take advantage of some of the benefits that married couples enjoy.Unmarried, cohabitating couples who share a car (or multiple vehicles) can get a joint insurance policy and pursue multi-vehicle discounts or discounts from bundling their car insurance with other policies.If you live together but each have your own car and separate auto insurance policies, you\\\\u2019ll likely need to list your significant other as an occasional driver on your policy. Listed drivers won\\\\u2019t have a positive or negative effect on your insurance rate \\\\u2013 similar to if you and a platonic roommate lived together but owned separate vehicles.If you name your partner as an excluded driver on your car insurance policy, they would not be able to legally drive your car.Insurance considerations for single driversEven though married couples tend to pay less for car insurance, you\\\\u2019re not going to get hitched just for the car insurance savings. There are other ways single people can lower their car insurance costs.1. Evaluate your coverage needs.Although your state may require you to carry a certain amount of liability insurance, other types of coverage \\\\u2013 such as collision insurance, comprehensive insurance, and full coverage \\\\u2013 are optional. You may decide you don\\\\u2019t need as much insurance coverage on your vehicle, especially if it\\\\u2019s a paid-off, older vehicle and you have savings to cover repairs out-of-pocket.2. Adjust your deductible.Most car insurance companies will allow you to opt for a higher deductible \\\\u2013 the amount of money you\\\\u2019ll pay out-of-pocket after a car accident before insurance kicks in \\\\u2013 in exchange for lower premiums. While this can help you save money overall, you must be prepared to pay that increased amount if you get into an accident.3. Improve your credit.Car insurance companies use a credit-based insurance score to help determine auto insurance rates (unless you live in a state that has outlawed the use of credit in underwriting). While this credit-based insurance score is not the same as your typical credit score, taking action to pay bills on time, settle delinquent accounts and lower your overall debt, can improve your standing in insurers\\\\u2019 eyes.4. Maintain an excellent driving record.The more time that passes where you don\\\\u2019t get into any car accidents, receive speeding tickets or file car insurance claims, the better your driving history will be.5. Ask for discounts.In addition to discounts for being an excellent driver, most major car insurers offer discounts for things such as bundling policies, serving in the military, getting good grades (if you\\\\u2019re a student driver), paying your premium annually instead of monthly, enrolling in auto pay and even opting for paperless billing. Check with your insurance company to see what discounts apply to you.6. Shop around for cheaper insurance.It doesn\\\\u2019t always benefit you to stay loyal to your insurance company \\\\u2013 especially when there could be other companies out there offering lower rates. Shop around or contact an insurance agent to help you find the best car insurance for your situation.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Nicole Dow\",\"Article Date\":\"Wed, Sep 13, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Pros and cons of CDs\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/pros-and-cons-of-cds-120038549.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Opening a new certificate of deposit is a big commitment. You\\\\u2019re essentially putting away a good chunk of your cash for a set period of time to earn interest on your savings, usually at a higher rate than a traditional savings account. You can withdraw it early, but a CD usually has high penalty fees if you do this.It\\\\u2019s a good idea to consider your full range of investment options before you choose a savings vehicle. A CD could be the perfect tool to help you reach your goals faster, or it could set you back on your journey.So are certificates of deposit worth it? We\\\\u2019ll explain the pros and cons of CDs and other financial alternatives to help you make an informed decision about where to park your money.Click to compare CDsPros and cons of CDsA CD is a good choice if you\\\\u2019re saving for a specific purchase that\\\\u2019s a long way off because you can pick a term length that ends near when you\\\\u2019ll need the money. Many retirees also use CDs to save money they won\\\\u2019t immediately need and avoid riskier investments in case of a financial downturn.CD prosHigher interest rates: CDs are usually the highest-earning account type at most banks. And your CD rate will remain a fixed rate, even if market rates fluctuate in response to rate changes by the Federal Reserve.Deposits are insured: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures accounts held at banks and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insures accounts held at credit unions up to $250,000 per account, per depositor.Helps you resist the temptation to spend: Having a lock on the CD can help you ensure you don\\\\u2019t withdraw your money before the CD matures to avoid an early withdrawal penalty.Go deeper: How to find the best CD ratesCD consHigh minimum deposit requirements: Most financial institutions require a sizable minimum deposit for CDs. Although, there are several types of CDs with various term lengths. You should ask your financial institution what their minimum deposit requirements are.Early withdrawal fees: Some banks only require you to forfeit your interest, but others charge high early withdrawal fees that can eat into your deposit. When considering a CD for your savings needs, you should think about your time horizon so that you can avoid dipping into your funds before your CD\\\\u2019s maturity date.May earn less if rates increase: Although a fixed CD rate feels like a low-risk way to grow your savings, you could hurt your long-term saving potential. If rates go up after you open the account, you\\\\u2019ll be stuck earning a lower rate until the end of your CD term, which could make your timeline for hitting your savings goals a lot longer.CDs vs. savings accountsSavings accounts are one of the most basic accounts you can find at any bank or credit union. Since fewer withdrawal restrictions exist, they\\\\u2019re a good way to store your liquid cash reserves. They make great choices for emergency funds and general-purpose savings.High-yield savings accounts are another safe way to grow your savings and they offer you the ability to withdraw money penalty free. They also have lower minimum balance requirements, if any.However, in many cases, they offer lower annual percentage yields than CDs.Go deeper: What is a high-yield savings account?CDs vs. money market accountsIf you\\\\u2019re looking for a higher rate of return on your savings, one account option that may be more comparable to a CD than a savings account is a money market account. These can also be great choices to park your liquid cash reserves, especially if you want quicker access to the money.Money market accounts are insured by the FDIC, tend to offer higher APYs than savings accounts and you can write checks or use ATMs. They often have considerably higher minimum deposit requirements.Go deeper: CD vs money market account, what\\'s the difference?CDs vs. investingFor most people, investing in stocks, bonds, or other higher-risk assets is recommended to save for your far-away financial goals, such as retiring or paying for your child\\\\u2019s college. That ensures you earn the highest return possible but still have time to recover when significant market downturns inevitably happen.Investing prosHighest potential for long-term gain: The stock market typically generates higher returns than a CD \\\\u2014 about 7% per year.Easier access to your money: You\\\\u2019ll need to sell your investments to use the cash, but this usually doesn\\\\u2019t come with early penalties like CDs do.Security investments insured by Securities Investor Protection Corp: This protects you if your brokerage firm goes under. It does not protect you if your investment value declines or if you invest in something that\\\\u2019s not covered by SIPC insurance.Investing consTaxes can be confusing: The IRS treats some investment returns differently than the interest you earn from a CD or other deposit account. For example, you may pay short-term or long-term capital gains tax depending on when you buy and sell stocks.Highest potential to lose money: One of the downsides of investing is that with greater potential rewards come greater risks. For example, the stock market declined by 56% from 2007 to 2009.Steep learning curve: It takes time to educate yourself so you can pick good investments.If you\\'re interested in opening a CD, consider the offers from the federally insured issuers below:\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Lindsay VanSomeren\",\"Article Date\":\"Tue, Sep 12, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is an excluded driver?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/excluded-driver-160555890.html\",\"Article Content\":\"An excluded driver is a member of your household named in your auto insurance policy whom you explicitly omit from being covered. They might be a roommate with a suspended license or your adult child who has racked up too many speeding tickets.Once someone has been named as an excluded driver, your auto insurance will not cover them if they drive any of the vehicles listed on your policy.Here\\\\u2019s what else you should know about excluded drivers, how to add them and how they impact your car insurance coverage.What licensed drivers can be listed on your policy?You are generally able to lend your vehicle to family members, household members and friends, and your auto insurance will cover them under the concept of permissive use.Even if a friend borrows your car and causes an accident, as long as they had your permission to use the car, your liability insurance should cover the damage.As a policyholder, you can also list others on your policy as named drivers who have permission to drive your insured vehicles and share full coverage. These additional drivers could include teen drivers, adult children living in your home or unmarried partners.You can also add people as non-rated drivers, meaning their driving history and other rating factors are not included in your rate calculations. You might add someone as a non-rated driver who only occasionally uses your car, such as a college student or deployed military family member. Named drivers, also known as listed drivers, should not drive your insured car regularly. Your insurance company will likely only allow listed drivers who have their own vehicle and\\\\/or valid insurance coverage.Excluded drivers are also specifically listed in your policy \\\\u2014 but for the express purpose of excluding them from coverage.Reasons for excluding a driverThere are many reasons why you might decide to exclude a driver from your car insurance policy, not the least of which is to save money on your premiums. Other reasons to exclude certain drivers are:You don\\\\u2019t want them driving your vehicle. You may live with people you simply don\\\\u2019t want using your car, such as a roommate or adult sibling. While many policies will automatically extend coverage to occasional drivers \\\\u2014 or even require you to add other adults living in the same home \\\\u2014 naming an excluded driver means that person cannot legally drive your vehicle.They\\\\u2019re young or inexperienced. A new or inexperienced driver, such as a teenager, can wreak havoc on your premiums, especially if they later get in an accident or get traffic citations. Instead of adding them to your existing coverage, you can name them as an excluded driver and then purchase an individual policy in just their name, customizing the coverage limits to their vehicle.They have a poor driving record. When there are other adults in your home, your carrier will typically want you to add them to the policy as a named insured or rated driver. If they have a history of traffic violations, car accidents, DUIs, or have had their driver\\\\u2019s license suspended in the past, that poor driving record can come back to bite you in the form of higher premiums. Consider excluding this high-risk driver from your coverage and having them buy their own policy for their own car.They have a history of too many claims. You may choose to exclude a driver from your coverage if they\\\\u2019ve filed too many insurance claims in the past, even if those claims were on another policy or with another carrier. Insurance providers look at claims history when rating drivers and calculating premiums, so excluding them from your policy can save money.How excluded drivers affect your claims and premiumsIf there is a problem driver in your home, one of the best things you can do for your insurance rates is add them as an excluded driver.If this bad driver isn\\\\u2019t excluded from your policy, your carrier may require you to include them as an authorized or rated driver, especially if they live with you. If they are an inexperienced driver, have a history of at-fault accidents or multiple claims, or have a driving record riddled with violations, you may find that your premiums are affected. This is often the case even if you don\\\\u2019t actually give that individual permission to drive your vehicle.By adding them as an excluded driver, both you and your carrier reduce your overall level of risk. Your insurance company is no longer responsible if they drive one of your listed vehicles and get in an accident. Your insurance premiums no longer take their driving history into account, saving you money.Risks of excluded driversOne of the biggest things to remember is that once you\\\\u2019ve excluded a driver from your policy, you cannot allow them to drive your vehicle under any circumstances. Doing so opens you (and them) up to personal liability, were they to be involved in an accident.Except in certain states, your car insurance company will not extend any coverage to a named excluded driver. This means that any property damage, bodily injury, or personal injury protection coverage is null when the excluded driver is behind the wheel, and you could be on the hook for any and all losses.What if an excluded driver has their own insurance?Just because a driver is excluded from one policy doesn\\\\u2019t mean that they cannot have their own insurance. In fact, if that individual plans to drive and\\\\/or has their own vehicle, they will need to purchase auto insurance.If that individual is involved in an accident while driving another vehicle (other than one covered by the policy on which they are excluded), their own coverage should kick in to cover any losses.What happens if you let an excluded driver use your car?If an excluded driver takes your vehicle and gets in an accident, it really comes down to the state and even the individual policy.If they\\\\u2019re at fault, they (and possibly you) may be liable for losses the other driver incurred.If the other driver is deemed at fault for the accident, there\\\\u2019s a good chance that their liability policy will cover any losses incurred, even if the excluded driver wasn\\\\u2019t supposed to be behind the wheel. This will be determined by the insurance adjusters following the accident.With that said: if you name someone as an excluded driver and then allow them to drive your vehicle, there will be repercussions. At the very least, as the policyholder you may be required to add that individual to your own auto insurance as an authorized driver. You can also expect your premiums to rise.How to exclude a driver from coverageEvery car insurance company has its own process for naming excluded drivers on a policy. In most cases, you\\\\u2019ll be asked to sign and submit a driver exclusion form as part of the process.It\\\\u2019s important to note that not all states allow for excluded drivers. Some states may offer limited coverage to excluded drivers, even after they are named on a policy. And in other cases, excluded drivers may only be added once you have shown that they have their own valid auto insurance coverage.You will want to look up the specific rules in your state and also speak with your carrier to see what options you have before moving forward.Can you remove an excluded driver?You\\\\u2019ll need to contact your insurance company if you want to remove an excluded driver. You may want to add them as a covered driver if they improved their bad driving record, for example. Or to take them off your policy altogether, perhaps because they moved out of your home.In any case, bear in mind that your car insurance rates could be affected.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Stephanie Colestock\",\"Article Date\":\"Tue, Sep 12, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is a named insured driver?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/named-insured-192452658.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Woman at the wheel of a carAs you might guess, the named insured on an auto insurance policy is the individual who purchases coverage and has their name listed on the policy declarations page.The named insured is responsible for paying premiums on the policy as well as filing claims with the insurance provider. They are the only ones authorized to make changes to the policy, such as adjusting coverage, adding authorized drivers or canceling the policy. In some cases, the named insured might be more than one person, such as spouses or joint owners of a vehicle.More responsibilities of the named insuredAs the owner of the auto insurance policy, the named insured is presumed to be the primary driver. This means that their driving record, credit history and more are taken into account when the carrier calculates premiums. The named insured also decides whom the policy covers, which affects premiums.The named insured may also be referred to as the policyholder or primary insured.Other people covered (or not covered) on a policyBeyond the named insured, other drivers may be covered or listed on an auto policy. Because the terms used to identify those drivers can sound similar \\\\u2014 like named driver, non-rated driver and excluded driver \\\\u2014 it\\\\u2019s important to understand the differences.What is a named driver?Additional drivers \\\\u2014 also known as named drivers \\\\u2014 are individuals who aren\\\\u2019t primary policyholders and can\\\\u2019t manage the coverage, but are added to the policy with permission to drive the covered vehicles. These additional drivers could include teenagers or adult children living in the home, unmarried partners, or even spouses who have their own auto insurance policy elsewhere (but have access to your vehicle). You can add named drivers who don\\\\u2019t live in your home but regularly drive your vehicle, such as a good friend or the nanny.An authorized or named driver on an auto policy is considered a rated driver, which means that their actions can affect your premium for coverage. Just adding another driver is likely to raise your rates. But if they get into an accident, get a speeding ticket or have their license suspended for moving violations, you may see an additional increase in your cost of coverage.Some insurance policies offer cheaper premiums by limiting coverage only to drivers named on a policy. These have been banned in some states.What is a non-rated driver?A non-rated driver is an individual who lives in your home or may occasionally drive your vehicle, but won\\\\u2019t affect your policy\\\\u2019s premiums. Also known as a listed or list-only driver, these individuals may have regular access to your vehicle but either don\\\\u2019t drive it or have their own insurance coverage.This may be the case with unmarried partners, roommates, deployed military family members, or even your adult child who is living with you temporarily. When someone is added as a non-rated, listed driver, they may be allowed to borrow your vehicle in a pinch, but aren\\\\u2019t expected to drive your car regularly. Your insurance company will likely only allow listed drivers who have their own vehicle and\\\\/or valid insurance coverage.Since these drivers have their own valid coverage, they won\\\\u2019t be taken into consideration when calculating the premiums for your policy.What is a permissive driver?Most traditional auto insurance policies extend coverage to permissive drivers, the occasional drivers who you might lend your vehicle to, like your best friend. These are non-rated drivers; that is, their driving history and other rating factors are not included in your rate calculations. But if your friend borrows your car and gets into an accident, as long as they had your permission to use the car your insurance should cover the damage.In some states, insurers can offer cheaper premiums by reducing coverage for permissive drivers through provisions known as step-down clauses. The coverage limits enjoyed by named drivers don\\\\u2019t apply; instead, coverage is limited to the state minimum.What is an excluded driver?In some cases, you may want to explicitly name someone on your policy who should not be covered. Once named as an excluded driver, this person\\\\u2019s rating factors (such as their driving history) won\\\\u2019t be factored into your rate. This may be beneficial if you have roommates who aren\\\\u2019t allowed to use your car, for example, or live with a sibling who has a poor driving record.The caveat here is that once a driver is excluded from coverage, they are expected not to have access to your vehicle. If they drive your vehicle and get into an accident, your insurance coverage will not apply. You could also be held liable for any damages or injuries that occur.How named drivers, non-rated drivers and excluded drivers affect your claims and premiumsIf you\\\\u2019re not the only person who ever drives your car, though, or if other adults have access to your vehicle, you may need to add other individuals to your policy in some capacity.Not all added drivers fall into the same category, though. Some drivers are added because they share full coverage and control of the policy. Others have permission to drive your vehicle on occasion and will affect your premiums, depending on factors like their personal coverage limits, but can\\\\u2019t make changes to your policy. And other drivers are excluded from your coverage.Rated drivers are those who actively drive vehicles on the policy, and whose driving records and personal factors can affect your rates.Non-rated drivers are those who have their own separate coverage and even their own vehicle, but may have access to or occasionally drive vehicles you own. Their driving history and personal factors won\\\\u2019t affect your premiums, but they\\\\u2019ll be covered if they get behind the wheel of your car.Excluded drivers are those who may live in your home but aren\\\\u2019t given permission to drive your vehicles. Their factors won\\\\u2019t affect your premiums, but they also won\\\\u2019t be covered if they drive your car and get in an accident.Determining which drivers should be named, added to, or excluded from your auto insurance policy will depend on how your vehicles are used, who lives with you, and what you can afford to spend on your premiums.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Stephanie Colestock\",\"Article Date\":\"Tue, Sep 12, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What does collision insurance cover?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/collision-insurance-191301984.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Collision coverage is auto insurance that helps protect the value of your car in the event of an accident.If you hit another car or back into a telephone pole, for instance, collision insurance will pay to either repair the damage or buy a vehicle of similar current value. In both cases, you pay a deductible, which can be anywhere from $0 to $2,500 or more but typically is about $500.Collision insurance can also help pay for car repairs if another driver hits you but does not have liability insurance \\\\u2014 or enough liability insurance \\\\u2014 to cover your expenses.If you don\\\\u2019t own your vehicle outright, your lender will probably require that you buy collision insurance. It is otherwise optional coverage, but it\\\\u2019s a good idea to have collision coverage if you have a car that you cannot afford to fix yourself.What does collision insurance cover \\\\u2014 and not cover?Collision insurance covers damage to your car when you hit another car or object like a guardrail. It also covers damage from a single-vehicle accident or rollover. Collision insurance can also cover damage from a pothole. Some collision policies include emergency roadside assistance.Collision insurance does not cover damage to other people\\\\u2019s cars; your liability coverage does that. Collision does not cover the cost of medical bills resulting from any injuries, either your own or others\\\\u2019.Collision insurance also does not cover theft, vandalism or damage from hitting an animal, or damage from natural disasters, such as falling tree branches, hail, or flooding. Those events are covered by comprehensive car insurance.How much will my collision coverage pay?Collision insurance will pay for the cost of repairs from a car accident. If your car is a total loss, your collision coverage will reimburse you for the actual cash value of your vehicle at the time of the accident. In both cases, you pay a deductible.If you owe more than the car\\\\u2019s estimated value at the time of the accident, you are responsible for the balance. You can buy gap insurance to cover this unpaid loan balance.How much does collision coverage cost?The average cost of collision insurance nationally was $371 per year in 2020, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That\\\\u2019s about a third of the average full-coverage car insurance premium of $1,176.Costs vary greatly from state to state \\\\u2014 from an average of $245 a year in Wisconsin to $528 a year in the District of Columbia \\\\u2014 but also from car to car. In general, the more it costs to repair your particular car, the more you will pay for collision insurance.Your premiums will also go up as your risk of having an accident goes up. So if you have prior accidents or are an inexperienced driver, expect to pay higher premiums. Collision car insurance for teens, for example, is significantly higher than it is for middle-aged drivers without recent accidents.In all cases, you can lower the cost of your collision coverage by choosing a higher deductible.Is collision coverage required?No, collision coverage is an optional add-on to your car insurance policy. No state requires collision coverage. However, if you are leasing or financing your car, your lender will likely require that you have full coverage, which includes collision and comprehensive car insurance as well as the liability car insurance required under your state laws.If you fail to buy collision and comprehensive coverages, your lender will buy policies \\\\u2014 very expensive policies \\\\u2014 to protect the value of its collateral, then add them to your loan balance.If you own your car outright, a good rule of thumb is if you could not comfortably afford to pay to replace your car, then you should buy collision coverage.How to save on collision coverageInsurance companies offer various add-on options that may help you save money in the event of an accident. Ask your insurer if they offer any of these programs:Collision deductible waiver. A collision deductible waiver lowers your out-of-pocket costs if you are in an accident caused by an uninsured driver. If you have added this option to your collision coverage, the insurance will waive your deductible in this case. Insurance companies will typically not cover hit-and-runs, except in Massachusetts and California when the driver is identified. Collision deductible waivers are inexpensive, a few dollars a month. It can be a good idea to add the waiver if you have a very high deductible or drive where there are a lot of uninsured drivers.Accident forgiveness. With accident forgiveness, your insurer agrees not to raise your premium after your first accident. Not all accidents qualify for forgiveness. For instance, insurers may exclude accidents with injuries or costly damages. In addition, you usually must be an experienced driver with a recent accident-free record to qualify. Adding accident forgiveness to your auto coverage can spare you the driving points and hefty premium hikes that often follow a collision claim.Disappearing deductibles. Also called vanishing deductibles, some insurance companies offer this to reward drivers who don\\\\u2019t file claims. For every year that you do not file a claim, your deductible is reduced, typically by $50 or $100 per year.Frequently asked questions about your car insurance policyHere are some common situations drivers encounter and wonder how their collision coverage apply.Can I get collision insurance without comprehensive car insurance?Yes, you can choose to buy collision insurance and not comprehensive insurance. Collision and comprehensive are two different types of insurance. While collision insurance covers damage to your car if you hit an object, comprehensive car insurance covers theft or damage from animal strikes, hail, falling tree branches, or other non-driving related events.My car is getting old. Should I drop my collision coverage?When to drop collision coverage is a common dilemma as the odometer on your car rises and the Blue Book value plummets. The general advice is that if the annual cost of the coverage plus your deductible is more than 10% of the cost to replace your vehicle, then it may be worth dropping collision coverage. But don\\\\u2019t drop your coverage if you need a car and cannot afford to buy another if yours is totaled.Do I need collision insurance if I\\\\u2019m an excellent driver?It\\\\u2019s true that if another driver causes an accident, their liability insurance is supposed to pay to repair your car. However, think about how much that could cost. A new car costs nearly $50,000, on average. At the same time, many drivers only carry the minimum amount of liability car insurance, between $5,000 and $25,000 depending on the state. Once that amount is exhausted, you\\\\u2019ll be left to foot the bill or sue. If you have collision insurance, your insurer will take care of both. And if you have uninsured motorist coverage that includes property damage, you may not need to tap into your collision insurance.Is my car covered if I wasn\\\\u2019t the one driving?Probably. Insurance typically travels with the car, not the driver. If someone else crashes your car \\\\u2014 as long as the person had your permission to drive the car and was not an excluded driver on the insurance policy \\\\u2014 your car will be covered under your collision insurance. An excluded driver is someone in your household who has been removed from your policy. This might be a teenage driver or a driver with an accident history that would raise your insurance cost.What if my car is totaled?If your car is totaled, your collision coverage will reimburse you for the value of your vehicle at the time of the accident, minus your deductible. This amount is negotiable to some degree and can include taxes and licensing costs you have already paid out.Are there other things that collision insurance will not cover?Neither comprehensive nor collision insurance pays for damage due to normal wear and tear or mechanical issues. Other common exclusions are damage incurred if you were engaged in illegal activity at the time of the accident, the cost to repair modifications that your insurer didn\\\\u2019t agree to cover, damage to your personal possessions, or damage incurred when an excluded driver was at the wheel.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Karen Aho\",\"Article Date\":\"Tue, Sep 12, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is a money market account?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/what-is-money-market-account-132821980.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Money market accounts are deposit accounts that share features of savings and checking accounts.

Here\\\\u2019s what to know if you\\\\u2019re interested in opening one.What is a money market account?As mentioned, money market accounts are similar to both savings and checking accounts. And like other deposit accounts, money market accounts are often insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Both national institutions provide up to $250,000 in deposit insurance on consumer bank account balances. This insurance protects your account balance if your bank or credit union defaults.A common misconception is that money market accounts are the same as money market funds.

Unlike money market accounts, which carry deposit insurance, money market funds are not deposit accounts or insured by the FDIC or NCUA.Instead, money market funds are a type of mutual fund you can invest in through a brokerage. These funds can gain or lose money regularly based on stock market performance. Your money market account balance isn\\\\u2019t tied to market performance.How do money market accounts work?While money market accounts have characteristics of savings and checking accounts, they often come with relatively high minimum balance requirements. For instance, you may need to maintain a $3,000 minimum balance with a money market account to avoid monthly fees. This generally isn\\\\u2019t the case with checking or savings accounts.In addition to minimum balance requirements, money market accounts may have tiered annual percentage yield (APY) structures that set them apart from other deposit accounts. Higher APYs may be reserved for account holders with larger balances, while smaller balances may earn less interest. For instance, a bank might offer a 0.10% APY on balances up to $5,000, a 0.50% APY on $5,001 to $10,000, and so on. Rates on money market accounts are typically variable, meaning they\\\\u2019ll likely change over time.As with other accounts, money market accounts may be subject to fees and limitations. Watch out for minimum balance fees, monthly maintenance fees, and more. And pay attention to withdrawal limits. While the Federal Reserve eased withdrawal limits in 2020, some banks still impose them. It\\\\u2019s common for banks to charge fees for exceeding six withdrawals in a month.Pros of money market accountsRelatively high APYsFlexibilityFDIC insuranceCons of money market accountsMay have high minimum balance requirementsMay have a tiered APY structureFees and withdrawal limits may applyMoney market accounts vs. other savings optionsSavings accountsTraditional savings accounts are widely available at banks and credit unions, and these accounts tend to offer nominal APYs and flexible access to your money. Your rate with a traditional savings account may be slightly lower than that of a money market account.While your balance will be easily accessible with both account types, money market accounts typically offer debit card access and check-writing capabilities, similar to what you\\\\u2019d get with a checking account. These features aren\\\\u2019t always available with savings accounts.Certificates of deposit (CDs)When you deposit your money into a CD, you essentially promise your bank you\\\\u2019ll deposit it for a fixed term, such as one or three years. In exchange, you\\\\u2019ll benefit from a high APY, which varies by bank. CD rates may be higher than money market account rates depending on your financial institution.Because CDs come with set terms, you\\\\u2019ll typically have to pay penalties if you withdraw your money early \\\\u2013 often a few months\\\\u2019 interest on the withdrawn amount. With a money market account, you typically won\\\\u2019t be required to leave your money deposited for a set time. Instead, you can withdraw it as you please up to your bank\\'s limits.High-yield savings accountsWith a high-yield savings account, your APY may be higher than what a money market account offers. For instance, you might get a 3.00% APY no matter your balance in a high-yield savings account and a 0.10% APY for money market account balances below $5,000. Both types of accounts typically offer easy access to your balance, allowing you to deposit and withdraw funds as you please.While check-writing and debit cards are common with money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts might not offer these features. But depending on the bank, some high-yield savings accounts may come with debit cards.Money market fundsWhile a money market account is an insured deposit account, a money market fund or money market mutual fund is an investment that the FDIC or NCUA doesn\\'t insure. Unlike money market accounts, where your balance won\\\\u2019t decrease due to market conditions, money market funds can gain or lose money depending on the market.In general, though, money market funds are considered fairly low-risk investments. That\\\\u2019s because the underlying fund invests in low-risk, short-term debt securities. Because money market funds are relatively low-risk, their historical returns aren\\\\u2019t as high as other higher-risk investments.Choosing a money market accountAs with any account, it\\\\u2019s essential to compare options if you\\\\u2019re interested in a new money market account. Researching the following factors can help you find an account that best meets your needs:APY: In general, a high APY can mean you earn more interest on your account balance. Compare rates as you shop around for a new money market account.Minimum balance: Certain accounts may have minimum balance requirements. Pay attention to any initial deposit or minimum balance requirements to ensure a new account is right for your financial situation.Account features: While many money market accounts offer check-writing privileges and debit card access, comparing different account features is still important. Look at potential restrictions on withdrawals. For instance, does the bank limit how much you can withdraw or how often you can take money out in a month?Fees: Some banks may charge you fees if your money market account balance drops below a specific amount. Other fees may apply as well. Keep in mind that if a money market account offers a high APY and high fees, it may not be the best choice. Calculate how fees may impact your balance in addition to interest before opening a new account.Managing a money market accountAs with other types of savings accounts, you\\\\u2019ll likely be able to track money market account transactions and review your balance online. Some banks may also offer a mobile app that allows you to access your account at any time. Others may have physical branches you can visit.Overall, a money market account may be a smart option for short- or medium-term savings goals. For instance, if you want to build an emergency fund or save for a car down payment, opening a money market account could work in your favor. These accounts aren\\'t great for long-term savings goals, such as setting aside cash for retirement, as investment accounts may offer better returns.Find the best Money Market Account rates!\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Jess Ullrich\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to open a money market account\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/how-to-open-money-market-account-165204823.html\",\"Article Content\":\"This image was created by Yahoo Finance using the Picsart AI image generator.Maybe you love the accessibility your checking account provides but hate that it doesn\\\\u2019t earn interest. If this is the case, a money market account may be worth considering. Money market accounts offer the flexibility of checking accounts, but they\\\\u2019re also interest-bearing like savings accounts, meaning you earn money on your deposits.While money market accounts have perks, they also have some drawbacks to consider. Here\\\\u2019s what you need to know about money market accounts, their pros and cons, and how to open one.What is a money market account?A money market account is a unique type of deposit account with checking and savings account features. These accounts generally come with debit cards and checkbooks, similar to what you\\\\u2019d get with a checking account.But unlike checking accounts which typically don\\\\u2019t earn interest, money market accounts often have variable interest rates comparable to high-yield savings account rates. Tiered rate structures may apply with money market accounts, with the best rates reserved for the highest balances. Depending on the credit union or bank, you may also need to meet a minimum balance requirement.But a money market account could be a good choice if you can easily meet the minimum balance requirement. These accounts offer the accessibility you\\\\u2019d get with a checking account, coupled with the decent interest earnings you\\\\u2019d get with a savings account.Preparing to open a money market accountDoing your due diligence before opening a new money market account is key. Many banks and credit unions offer these accounts, and you can compare new account options online at your existing institution or at another local branch. Here\\\\u2019s what to look at as you prepare to open a new account:Interest rates: Different banks and credit unions offer different interest rates, and in general, a higher rate is more favorable because it\\\\u2019ll help you earn more interest on your money. Tiered rates are common with money market accounts. For instance, you might get a 1.15% rate with a $1,000 balance and a 4.05% rate with a $10,000 balance.Fees: You\\\\u2019ll want to consider account fees and how they could impact your overall earnings, too. Common fees for money market accounts include monthly maintenance and low balance fees.Minimum balance requirements: Certain money market accounts may require higher initial deposits or minimum balances than traditional savings accounts. For instance, you might need to maintain a balance of $2,000. Minimum balance requirements vary by institution.Lender reputation: Research lender reputation before you sign up for a new account, especially if you\\\\u2019re considering a bank or credit union you\\\\u2019re unfamiliar with. Ensure the institution is FDIC- or NCUA-insured and look at feedback on consumer review sites like Trustpilot and Consumer Affairs.ATM access: If free ATM access is important to you, learn more about prospective accounts\\\\u2019 ATM networks and whether you can easily access your money for free locally.Steps to open a money market account1. Choose a financial institutionAfter thoroughly researching your options, choose your bank or credit union and money market account. Consider preparing a short list of potential options and narrowing it down to one as you move forward.2. Gather necessary documentsYou\\\\u2019ll need to provide certain documents and information to open your new account. The bank or credit union will probably ask for your Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), a valid government-issued ID like your driver\\\\u2019s license, and proof of address. Gathering this information before you open an account can simplify the process.3. Review account terms and conditionsBefore opening an account, ensure that you review the account\\\\u2019s terms and conditions. These documents outline potential fees, minimum balance requirements, and more. You may want to review them for each account on your shortlist before choosing the best option.4. Sign up for an accountOnce you\\\\u2019ve taken these steps, it\\\\u2019s time to open your account. Many institutions let you sign up for a new account online, which can be convenient. Others let you sign up in person or over the phone. Choose the option that\\\\u2019s most comfortable for you.Funding a money market accountAs mentioned, money market accounts often have an initial deposit or minimum balance requirement, which may be higher than you\\\\u2019d see with checking or savings accounts. Minimum balances can vary depending on where you choose to open an account.If your new account requires you to make an initial deposit, you can generally do so by transferring money from an existing account or depositing a check. To ensure that your balance continues to grow, consider setting up automatic transfers from your savings account to your money market account. You can generally do this by logging into your online account, clicking \\\\u2018transfer\\\\u2019 or \\\\u2018transfer or pay,\\\\u2019 and creating a new monthly transfer.Managing a money market accountIn general, money market accounts are fairly easy to manage. The main things you\\\\u2019ll want to do are tracking interest earnings and avoiding fees. Since rates can change over time, tracking how much interest your money earns can help you ensure your account stays aligned with your financial goals. And doing things like meeting or exceeding any minimum balance requirements can help you avoid fees.Make it a point to log into your money market account online regularly. Doing so will offer insight into how your savings are performing.Things to consider when opening an MMAWhile money market accounts have many perks, they also have a few drawbacks. Variable interest rates are a potential downside, as it\\\\u2019s possible your interest rate will decrease as the market changes. For example, your rate may be above 4.00% when you open your money market account, but it could drop to 3.00% if your bank adjusts its rates.Fees are also a key consideration, as these charges could hurt your balance over time. Take care to avoid fees as much as you can.There\\\\u2019s also the unlikely possibility that your financial institution could fail.

Certain banks and credit unions offer these accounts in addition to savings and checking accounts. Money market accounts share some features of checking and savings accounts, such as check-writing capabilities and decent interest rates.But they have some distinct features too. For instance, you might see relatively high figures listed for money market account minimum balance requirements. Your minimum balance is the amount your bank requires to establish your account, earn interest, or avoid fees. Here\\\\u2019s what to know about money market account minimum balances if you\\\\u2019re considering opening one.Find the best Money Market Account rates!Money market account minimum balance requirementsWhen it comes to money market account minimum balance requirements, there\\\\u2019s not one set amount. Instead, minimum balance requirements vary by bank or credit union, and sometimes by individual account. So while one bank may require you to maintain a $2,000 minimum balance in your money market account to avoid fees, another might not have a minimum balance requirement.In addition to minimum balance requirements, certain institutions may also have initial deposit requirements for money market accounts. This is the amount your bank or credit union requires you to add to your account after opening it. As with minimum balance requirements, initial deposit requirements also vary by institution. For instance, you might see a $500 initial deposit requirement at one credit union and a $0 initial deposit at another.Factors that influence money market account minimum balancesWith money market accounts, it\\\\u2019s fairly common to see a tiered rate structure, meaning your interest rate differs depending on your account balance. Accounts with large balances, such as $10,000 or more, may get the highest rates, while smaller balances may only be eligible for lower rates.While not all MMAs have them, fees might apply if you don\\\\u2019t maintain the minimum balance your bank or credit union requires. Before opening a new money market account, it\\\\u2019s essential to review its terms and conditions, which cover any minimum balance requirements, account rates, and potential fees.Advantages of meeting minimum balance requirementsIf your money market account has a minimum balance requirement, it\\\\u2019s advantageous for you to meet it \\\\u2014 banks and credit unions may charge monthly fees for falling below the minimum balance requirement, and doing so may also result in a lower interest rate, depending on whether there\\\\u2019s a tiered rate structure in place.If it\\\\u2019s doable, it can be beneficial to maintain a large enough balance to get the best possible interest rate for your money market account. For example, say your bank offers a 4.50% rate for balances $10,000 or more, but a 1.50% rate for balances $1,000 or less; the difference between interest earnings can be substantial:This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Strategies to help you meet money market account minimum balance requirementsIf you\\\\u2019re concerned you\\\\u2019ll struggle to meet your money market account\\\\u2019s minimum balance requirements, here are a couple of approaches you can take:Set up automatic transfers: Using automatic transfers from an existing savings account could help you maintain your MMA\\\\u2019s minimum balance. These are typically easy to set up through your bank account\\\\u2019s online dashboard.Consolidate accounts: If you have a traditional low-rate savings account, you might also consider consolidating that balance with your money market account balance. This could result in a higher interest rate and more money earned on your balance.Reallocate your budget: Revisiting and reallocating your budget could also help you meet your MMA\\\\u2019s minimum balance requirement. For instance, you might reduce your spending in certain categories and move any money saved into your MMA.While meeting your MMA\\\\u2019s minimum balance requirement is an admirable goal, it\\\\u2019s important to consider your overall financial goals as well. If meeting that requirement means stretching yourself too thin financially, it may not be worth it. Alternatively, a different MMA or high-yield savings account with a low or no minimum balance requirement may be a better choice.Things to consider before opening a money market accountBefore opening an MMA, consider whether you can comfortably meet any minimum balance requirements. Also, be aware that your interest rate could change as your bank or credit union adjusts its deposit account rates. While you won\\\\u2019t lose money with an MMA, you could earn less interest due to future rate decreases.As you compare accounts, research applicable fees, requirements, and rates. If available, read the terms and conditions of each account you\\\\u2019re considering.

Before you open one, it\\'s crucial to understand how they work and their limitations.Features of a money market accountMoney market accounts are hybrid bank accounts, offering features that you can get from both checking and savings accounts. Here\\'s a quick summary of the features of money market accounts and how they compare to other types of savings accounts:Types of money market accountsAs with savings accounts, there are two types of money market accounts: traditional and high-yield accounts. Traditional money market accounts offer relatively low interest rates, albeit better than most traditional savings accounts on average.In contrast, high-yield money market accounts offer interest rates that are much higher than traditional money market accounts. That said, they may or may not offer higher rates compared to some high-yield savings accounts.Find the best Money Market Account rates!How money market accounts workAs you compare your savings options, here\\'s a breakdown of how money market savings accounts work:Access to funds: Like a checking account, you can typically access your money using a debit card, paper checks, an ATM card, or via bank transfer. That said, you may be limited to six withdrawals per month, which is a feature shared with savings accounts. After that, your bank or credit union may charge an excessive withdrawal fee or even decline your requests.Interest: You can expect to earn interest on your balance, typically at a higher rate than traditional checking and savings accounts. That said, interest rates can vary depending on the financial institution and the type of money market account you choose. Also, some financial institutions may offer tiered rates based on your balance.Monthly fees: Like checking accounts, some money market accounts charge monthly fees, though you may be able to get yours waived if you meet certain criteria.Insurance: Like other deposit accounts, the funds in your money market account are typically federally insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).Balance requirements: Balance requirements can vary, but in some cases, you may need to meet a certain minimum requirement to avoid a monthly fee or even to earn interest.Money market account prosThere are a few benefits to using a money market account to stash your savings over other options:Higher interest rates compared to savings accounts: In most cases, money market accounts offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. However, some high-yield savings accounts can be competitive with high-yield money market accounts.Lower risk compared to other investment options: If you\\'re saving for short-term goals or emergency needs and don\\'t want to risk losing money, a money market account can be a great alternative to investing the money.Easy access to funds: While there may be limits on how often you can withdraw, you\\'ll still have easier access to your funds than with a savings account.Money market account consWhile there are some clear benefits to using a money market account for your savings, it\\'s also important to consider the potential drawbacks:Limited withdrawals: If you plan to use your money market account for everyday banking, think again. While the federal government no longer limits monthly withdrawals to six on money market and savings accounts, many banks and credit unions have retained the limit and may charge you a fee for excessive withdrawals.Lower potential returns compared to riskier investments: If you\\'re looking for a place to put your money for long-term financial goals, you\\'ll have a better chance of earning a higher return with an investment account.Fees and charges can eat into returns: If your money market account charges a monthly fee, it\\'ll diminish or even neutralize your interest earnings.Choosing a money market accountIf you\\'re considering a money market account, it\\'s important to research and compare multiple options before settling on one. As you shop around, here are some factors to consider:Interest rates, including stipulations like balance requirements or tiersMonthly fees and excessive withdrawal feesMinimum deposit requirements to open an accountOptions for funds accessFor the most part, online banks offer the best money market account interest rates, but some traditional banks and credit unions also offer them.Managing a money market accountHere are some steps you can take to make the most of your money market account and your short-term savings goals:Track your account activity: Keep track of your deposits and balance, particularly if you use the account to work toward a specific financial goal. Also, track your withdrawals to ensure you don\\'t exceed your account\\'s monthly limit.Evaluate and adjust your saving strategies: Regularly assess your approach to your short-term savings goals and adjust as needed. For example, if you\\'ve recently incurred some emergency expenses, it may make sense to focus on replenishing your emergency fund over other goals, such as a vacation or home down payment.Plan for long-term savings goals: While a money market account can be a good spot for short-term savings needs, you\\'ll be better off with an investment account for long-term financial goals like retirement, education planning, and more. While investing is riskier, it\\'ll also increase your potential for higher returns over time.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Can you lose money in a money market account?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/can-you-lose-money-in-money-market-account-182341738.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Money market accounts act as a hybrid between a checking account and a savings account, offering higher interest rates and flexible access to your funds \\\\u2014 albeit with some limitations.It\\'s technically possible to lose money in a market account, but not in the same way you can lose money in an investment account. Depending on the terms of your money market account, you could lose value to fees and inflation.If you\\'re considering putting your money in a money market account for short-term savings goals, here\\'s what you should know.What is a money market account?A money market account is a type of deposit account that you can use for short-term savings. Like a checking account, a money market account typically allows you to access your funds through a linked debit card, paper checks, or an ATM card.At the same time, money market accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts, although they also usually come with the same monthly withdrawal limits. If you withdraw money more than six times in a month, you may incur a fee with each additional withdrawal.Money market accounts may have steep deposit requirements and even charge a monthly fee, though you may be able to get the charge waived if you maintain a minimum balance. Your interest rate may be flat regardless of your balance, or you may be offered tiered rates based on your balance.Can you lose money in a money market account?Unlike an investment account subject to risk, you won\\'t lose money in a money market account due to investment losses. However, there are other ways your account balance can decrease over time or lose value in the long run:You can lose money to fees: If your account charges a monthly fee that you can\\'t get waived, or you end up dealing with other fees, such as excessive withdrawal penalties, your account balance could drop if the fees exceed the interest you earn in the account.Your interest rate can decline: Banks and credit unions set interest rates based on a variety of economic factors. If you open a money market account when rates are high but steadily decline, the value you thought you would get would decrease along with the rates.Your money will lose spending power over time: Even when money market account interest rates are high, they\\'re still typically not high enough to outpace the prevailing inflation rate. That\\'s why these and other types of savings accounts are best used for short-term financial needs and goals rather than long-term objectives.While you can\\'t necessarily avoid the prospect of your balance losing value due to inflation, you can avoid potential fees by shopping around and comparing rates and fees across multiple financial institutions.In particular, look for money market accounts that don\\'t charge monthly maintenance fees or that make it easy for you to get the fee waived each month.If you\\'re considering using a money market account for your regular banking, consider opening a checking account and a money market account or high-yield savings account instead so you don\\'t lose money to excessive withdrawal fees.Is a money market account FDIC insured?If you open a money market account with a bank, it\\'s very likely that your funds will be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The same is also true if you open the account with a credit union, but coverage for those institutions comes from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).Covered accounts include:Checking accountsSavings accountsMoney market accountsCDsThe FDIC and NCUA offer insurance protection to consumers in the event that a bank or credit union fails. If that happens, your balance is protected up to $250,000 per financial institution, per person, per ownership category.For the vast majority of Americans, that\\'s plenty of coverage. But if you have more than $250,000 that you want to place in a money market account, consider spreading your funds across accounts with multiple banks or credit unions to ensure that all of your money is protected.Alternatives to money market accountsWhile a money market account can be a great place to stash some cash for short-term needs, high deposit and balance requirements and monthly fees may leave you looking for alternatives. Here are a few other options you may want to consider:High-yield savings accounts: A high-yield savings account can offer interest rates that rival even the best money market account rates. In most cases, these accounts also don\\'t charge monthly service fees.CDs: Interest rates on both money market and high-yield savings accounts are variable, meaning they\\'ll fluctuate over time. If you want to lock in a fixed interest rate on your funds and can leave the money alone for a set period, a CD could be a good fit. CD terms can range from just a few months to several years and can offer the highest rates for any savings account. That said, if you withdraw your money before your account matures, you may incur a penalty.Low-risk investments: If you want to keep your money relatively safe but aren\\'t saving for a specific goal, you may consider investing in low-risk securities, such as money market mutual funds and bond funds. While these options present a higher risk of losing your money, they can also potentially generate higher returns.As you consider your current financial needs and goals, take your time to research all of your options to determine which one is the best fit for you.Find the best Money Market Account rates!\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is direct deposit?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/what-is-direct-deposit-165957739.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Pay tax schedule date in calendar or bill payment recurring agenda, salary accountant plan or annual money subscription cartoon illustration, budget target or loan credit payday imageDirect deposit is an electronic transfer of money into a bank account (usually a checking account) that doesn\\'t use a paper check or cash. Most people come across direct deposit when starting a job and enrolling in an employer\\'s direct deposit program for their pay. Still, the term can describe many electronic transfers between financial institutions.Direct deposits, handled by the Automated Clearing House transaction system, are used to disburse government payments such as Social Security, veterans\\' benefits, and tax refunds. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, most federal relief payments were made via direct deposit.Direct deposit is faster, more secure than a paper check, and cheaper for banks to process. It\\'s also more convenient for you because once you set it up for your pay or other regular payments, deposits happen automatically. You can also split a single direct deposit payment between different accounts.Direct deposit can also save you money since many banks will allow you to waive checking account fees if you set up direct deposit of your paycheck or benefits payment.How does direct deposit work?Direct deposit works by your employer running payroll on preset days and triggering payments to employers where money goes from their business account to individual, personal bank accounts. So rather than being issued a paper check, you\\'ll see your paycheck amount as a deposit into your bank account.Direct deposit can pay you as frequently as you would get paid through a physical check. For instance, if you get paid every two weeks, direct deposit can be set up to pay employees every two weeks. Likewise, if you get paid on the first and 15th of every month, you can get paid through direct deposit that way as well.You can set up direct deposit through your payroll system if you work for yourself. First, you\\'ll need to have a business bank account. Then, you can create a direct deposit from your business bank account to your personal one. It still takes a few days to process payroll, so give yourself a cushion for payment. That means if you have bills on autopay from your personal bank account, be sure to pay yourself from your business bank account early enough to make those payments on time.Direct deposit isn\\'t just for work-related settings and paying employees. For example, you can set up direct deposit to receive your tax refund, pay child support or alimony, or manage your bills.Benefits of direct depositSpeedPaper checks hold up the payment process because you have to wait for payroll to run, paychecks to get issued, and the employee has to find time to deposit that check. With direct deposit, your company can run payroll, and you can receive those funds in your account within a couple of days.SecureWhether it\\'s from the business side or the employer side, you don\\'t run the risk of losing a paycheck with direct deposit. Everything happens electronically.FlexibilityYou can set up your direct deposit to go to multiple accounts. That means if you want some money to hit your regular checking account and then some to hit a savings account, you can. This means some funds can go directly into building up your savings rather than wait on you to trigger that transaction.Discounts and dealsSome banks offer deals on accounts that set up direct deposit. If you set up direct deposit and receive your paycheck electronically, you could avoid paying a monthly maintenance fee or other charges.How can I set up a direct deposit?If you have a bank account, you can set up direct deposit.Whether you\\'re starting a new job or your current job is moving to a direct deposit system, you\\'ll need to talk to your company\\'s payroll or human resources department to get started. You\\'ll usually need:Your bank accounting numberYour bank routing numberThe name of the financial institutionThe type of account you have (checking or savings, for example)You can find these details when you log into your bank\\'s website and click on the account you\\'d like the money to go into. Each banking portal is different but look for \\\\\"accounting\\\\\" and \\\\\"routing\\\\\" numbers. You can also find these numbers on your personal checks, if you have those.Some companies or payroll systems might have additional requests when you set up your account. For instance, some request you bring in a voided check with your banking information.After you\\'ve submitted your banking documents, your company will set up your payroll information and sync your data with their payroll schedule. Now, payroll can be processed, and employees can get paid. Depending on your employer and the company\\'s payroll system, it can take a few days to several weeks. Ask your company\\'s human resources representative when to expect your first direct deposit.When you set up direct deposit, your company will have a payroll portal you can log into to check your payment details. This includes when you last got paid, how much that payment was, and how that check was paid out, including Social Security, Medicare, state taxes (if any), and any other withholdings you have set up.

And since most banks and credit unions provide online access and mobile apps, you can easily track and manage your checking account at your convenience.If you\\\\u2019d like to open a new checking account, here\\\\u2019s what to look for in a bank, how the process works, and what documentation you\\\\u2019ll need to provide.Choosing a bankYou\\\\u2019ve got plenty of options if you\\\\u2019d like to open a checking account. Traditional banks, credit unions, and online banks all offer these accounts. But fees and features vary across accounts, and of course, you\\\\u2019ll want to ensure you\\\\u2019re banking with a trustworthy, reputable institution.Before selecting an account, be sure to read the terms and conditions of potential accounts and review account features, accessibility, and institution reputation.Possible things to consider as you shop around for a new checking account include:Fees: Common fees include overdraft, non-sufficient funds (NSF), and monthly service fees. Some banks and credit unions may also charge low balance fees depending on account requirements.ATM availability: Some institutions have more extensive ATM networks than others. A large ATM network is ideal, as it allows you to easily access your money without worrying about out-of-network ATM fees.Access to physical branches: If you\\\\u2019d like to bank in person, consider whether physical branches are easily accessible in your area.Account bonuses: Certain institutions may offer checking account bonuses, often worth $100-$300, to entice potential customers to open a new account. Generally, you\\\\u2019ll need to meet certain criteria to earn a checking account bonus, such as setting up direct deposit or depositing a set amount within a specific timeframe.Other features: Also look into other features, such as whether the account earns interest or offers online bill pay. Many accounts provide the latter, but not the former.Mobile app access: If you prefer to bank on the go, be sure your bank or credit union has a mobile app you can use to track and manage your spending.Bank or credit union reputation: As a first step, ensure that each institution you\\\\u2019re considering has FDIC or NCUA deposit insurance. If your bank or credit union fails, this insurance will protect your checking account balance, generally up to $250,000.\\\\u00a0Also, look at the CFPB complaint database and consumer review sites to learn about past banking customers\\\\u2019 experiences.Find the best checking account ratesGathering required documentsAfter you\\\\u2019ve narrowed down your options, it\\\\u2019s time to gather the required documents to open a checking account. In addition to providing some basic personal information, you\\\\u2019ll also need to verify the information you share.Your bank or credit union will likely request a copy of your Social Security card, Individual Tax Identification card, driver\\\\u2019s license, or passport to verify your identity. You\\\\u2019ll probably also need to verify your address with a copy of a recent utility bill, mortgage statement, or rent payment. Having these handy before you complete an application can make the process quicker and easier.Filling out the applicationCompleting an application for a new checking account is fairly simple, especially if you\\\\u2019ve gathered the necessary documents beforehand. Most banks and credit unions let you open an account online, though some may let you do so over the phone or at a physical branch.Before moving forward with any application, ensure you read the online terms and conditions of a potential account. Taking this step will help you better understand account features, fees, and requirements. Note that most institutions only allow you to open a new checking account if you\\\\u2019re 18 or your state\\\\u2019s age of majority. Some may have other requirements too. For instance, you may need to be a credit union member to open an account.Provided you meet all requirements, you\\\\u2019ll need to provide personal information on your checking account application, like your name, address, and email. Your bank or credit union may also ask if you\\\\u2019re currently employed and request that you input your annual income. Additionally, you\\\\u2019ll likely need to share copies of one or more documents mentioned above for verification purposes.Funding the accountMany institutions require a minimum deposit to open a new account. Typically, these deposits are relatively small, often up to $25. You can fund your new account online or in person by transferring from another bank account, writing a check, or using an existing debit card.If your new checking account has a minimum balance requirement, deposit enough funds to avoid potential low balance fees. High minimum balance requirements are uncommon with checking accounts, but they sometimes apply.Activating the accountIn addition to funding your new account, you may also need to verify it via email as an added security measure. Many institutions also require that you set up multi-factor authentication, which involves providing multiple data points to verify your identity. For instance, if you\\\\u2019d like to log into your new online account, you may need to provide a unique SMS code or answer a security question and share your username and password.You\\\\u2019ll likely receive a debit card in the mail within 5-7 business days after opening a new checking account, and you\\\\u2019ll need to activate that as well. Your new card will typically come with a sticker on the front with a phone number. Call that number to verify you\\\\u2019ve received your card and activate it.Activating your account and debit card will ensure you can easily access your money and take advantage of your new checking account\\\\u2019s features, such as online bill pay. Setting up multi-factor authentication and verifying receipt of your card also help protect your account from unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Jess Ullrich\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Can you cash a check without a bank account or ID?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/can-you-cash-check-without-bank-account-id-155116813.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Cashing a check is relatively easy if you have a bank account and a photo ID to prove your identity. But if you belong to one of the roughly 5.9 million households in the US without access to a bank checking account or you don\\'t have a valid photo ID, you\\'ll have a little less flexibility.So can you cash a check without a bank account or ID? Yes, but it may be a bit more complicated or inconvenient. Here\\'s what you need to know.Understanding the check-cashing processWhen you receive a check, you can deposit the funds into your checking account \\\\u2014 either in person or via your bank\\'s mobile app \\\\u2014 or you can cash it.Before you cash a check, you\\'ll need to sign or endorse the back of the document. There\\'s no fee to cash a check with your own bank. But if you don\\'t have a bank account, you may cash it with the issuing bank or utilize a check-cashing service, for which you\\'ll be charged a fee.The fee can vary depending on the bank or check-cashing service, and it may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the check\\'s value. In some cases, it can be as much as 12% of the check amount.Additionally, some check-cashing companies may try to upsell you on other expensive services they offer, such as payday loans. You could also be at risk of being robbed by people who are aware that customers leaving check-cashing stores may be carrying a lot of cash.Find the best checking account ratesOptions for cashing a check without an IDRegardless of where you go, having an ID is generally required to cash a check in person. However, there may be some alternatives, depending on your situation:ATM: If you have a bank account but don\\'t have an ID on hand, you may be able to cash your check at one of your bank\\'s ATMs. Keep in mind, though, that not all banks offer this feature.Mobile check-cashing app: Some mobile apps allow you to cash a check without a bank account. PayPal is one example and even offers instant access to your funds for a small fee.Third-party endorsement: You may be able to sign the check over to someone else and have them cash it for you. Simply write \\\\\"Pay to the order of\\\\\" and include the person\\'s name. Keep in mind, though, that many banks and even check-cashing services may not accept third-party checks due to a risk of fraud. If they do, they may still require your ID to verify that you authorized the endorsement.Options for cashing a check without a bank accountIf you\\'re wondering how to cash a check without a bank account, the process is a bit easier than if you don\\'t have an ID:Issuing bank: When you cash a check, the financial institution or check-cashing store is taking the risk that the account the check is drawn from may not have enough funds to cover the check amount. However, if you go to the bank that issued the check, the teller can check the account balance and confirm that information. Keep in mind, though, that the issuing bank may charge a fee for the service to non-customers.Retailers: Some retailers, including Walmart, Kroger, and Safeway offer check-cashing and other money services in their stores. They typically charge a fee, but it\\'s generally lower than what you\\'d pay at a check-cashing store.Check-cashing stores: You can visit a local check-cashing store to cash your check. Keep in mind, though, that this option tends to be more expensive than the others.Note that retailers often have limits on how much they\\'re willing to cash. In contrast, checking-cashing stores may not have a limit as long as they can verify the check. If you\\'re wondering how to cash a large check without a bank account, the issuing bank is probably your best bet.Tips for safe and secure check cashingIf you don\\'t have a bank account or an ID, it\\'s crucial that you take steps to protect yourself and your funds during the check-cashing process. Here are some things you can do:Verify the check\\'s legitimacy: If you\\'ve received a check from an individual or organization you know and trust, you may not be concerned about the document\\'s legitimacy. But if you\\'ve received a check out of the blue, contact the issuing bank listed on the check to verify that it\\'s real. Rather than using the phone number listed on the check, look up the bank\\'s name online and contact its official customer service line.Research check-cashing services: Because check-cashing services can charge high fees, it\\'s important to shop around and compare several options to limit your costs.Use someone you trust for a third-party endorsement: If you\\'re hoping to cash a check with a third-party endorsement, make sure you pick someone you trust to avoid theft.Protect your personal information: Regardless of how you cash the check, don\\'t give out any personal information that isn\\'t necessary for the check-cashing transaction. That includes sensitive information like your Social Security number and date of birth.Alternatives to check-cashing servicesIf you want to avoid costly fees, inconveniences and even some risks, here are some alternatives to using a check-cashing service:Opening a bank account: Consider opening an account with a local or online bank to make it easier to deposit funds and manage your money. If you\\'re concerned about having negative items on your bank history report, some banks offer second-chance bank accounts that don\\'t consider this information when you apply.Requesting a new payment method: If you don\\'t have an ID, you may consider asking the payer to send the money through a peer-to-peer payment app or another way, so you don\\'t have to provide your ID to get the funds.Getting a prepaid debit card: You don\\'t need a bank account to open a prepaid debit card. Once you open an account, you can deposit checks through the card issuer\\'s mobile app without a fee, then use your card to spend the funds.Take your time to research all of your options to determine the best fit for you.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Can you have two checking accounts at the same bank?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/can-you-have-two-checking-accounts-same-bank-211421331.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Having multiple checking accounts can make it easier to organize your finances, but managing your money across different banks and credit unions can complicate things. So, can you have two checking accounts at the same bank? Generally, yes. Here\\'s what you need to know and whether opening multiple checking accounts is a good idea.Understanding checking accountsA checking account is a type of deposit account that you can use for everyday money management. It\\'s generally used as a hub for all of your financial activity. You\\'ll receive deposits from your employer, which you can then use to pay bills, make debt payments, and make everyday financial transactions.Checking accounts offer easy access to your money via a debit card, personal checks, ATMs, and online transfers. They\\'re generally risk-free, and in rare cases, they may even offer rewards in the form of cash back on your debit card purchases or a high interest rate on your balances.In most cases, however, they don\\'t offer interest, and some banks charge monthly fees and fees for overdraft protection and other services.Can you have two checking accounts at the same bank?Each bank has its own policies for how many accounts you can have. But in general, having more than one checking account with the same bank is possible.For example, you may choose to have an individual account plus a joint account with a partner or teenage child. It can also be a good idea if you\\'ve started a business and want to separate your personal and business expenses.Check with your bank to learn about the process for opening a second checking account. While some allow you to open another account online and link it to your online banking, others may require you to contact them or open the account in person.Find the best checking account ratesReasons for having multiple checking accountsThere are several good reasons to consider opening more than one checking account. Here are some of the advantages to consider:Better organization of funds: If you\\'re on your own, you may not need to have more than one checking account. But if you have a partner or a teenager, using multiple checking accounts can help you better organize your finances, budget, and track expenses between multiple people.Separation of personal and business expenses: Even if you\\'re running a sole proprietorship, opening a second checking account is crucial for maintaining proper expense tracking, especially for tax season. Keeping personal and business expenses in the same account will make it difficult to know which ones you can deduct on your business tax return.Easier tracking of expenses and budgeting: Using multiple checking accounts could potentially help you better track and budget for specific expenses. For example, you could have one checking account specifically for debt payments, another for recurring expenses, and another for discretionary funds.Easier access: Many online banks don\\'t have physical branches, so it can be tough to deposit cash. If you prefer the features of an online bank but need to make cash deposits now and then, you may consider opening a second account with a bank that has local branches where you live.Potential drawbacks of having multiple checking accountsWhile there are some clear advantages to using more than one checking account to manage your money, there are also some downsides to keep in mind:Extra fees and expenses: If your bank charges a monthly fee, there\\'s typically a way you can get it waived. But if you spread your income and expenses across multiple checking accounts, it may be harder to meet the eligibility criteria for each account. One way to combat this is to pick a bank that doesn\\'t charge monthly service fees.Difficulty in managing multiple accounts: While using multiple checking accounts can simplify your finances in some ways, it can make things more complicated in others. Unless you use budgeting software to keep track of all of your accounts and transactions in one place, it can be difficult to manage all of your accounts and stay organized.Increased risk of overdrafts: Spreading your money across multiple accounts means that you have less funds in each account. Even if you have a system in place to keep track of each account, you\\'re still at risk of overdrafts, which can be costly.Alternatives to multiple checking accountsIf you\\'re unsure about using multiple checking accounts to manage your money, here are some potential alternatives to consider:Online banking tools: Many banks offer budgeting and expense-tracking tools that can help you improve your financial management. Check with your bank to see what\\'s available. If your bank doesn\\'t offer financial tools, consider switching to a financial institution that does.Budgeting apps: Budgeting apps can offer a host of features to help you better manage your money. Some even allow you to link multiple financial accounts and import transactions from each one, so you can manage everything in one place. Not all budgeting apps are created equal, however, so it can take some time and research to find the right one for you.High-yield savings accounts: If you have specific savings goals you want to work toward, having one or more high-yield savings accounts could be a better approach. Some banks also allow you to open multiple savings accounts, making it easier to track each goal separately. What\\'s more, you can earn a high interest rate on your balances.As you think about your situation and goals, take your time to research all of your options to find the best strategy for you.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Can you deposit someone else\\\\u2019s check in your account?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/can-you-deposit-someone-elses-check-in-your-account-233027454.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Your parents wrote a check to your child for his birthday.

If you sign the check as that individual and deposit it into your account, you could be charged with check forgery.When you can deposit someone else\\'s checkUsually, when cashing a check, two parties are involved: the payer who writes the check and the payee who deposits or cashes it. But with third-party checks, the check is cashed in another person\\\\u2019s name.Although you can legally deposit a third-party check under certain circumstances, not all banks will accept them, as banks can set their own policies regarding third-party checks.There are a few scenarios where you may want to deposit a check written out to someone else:You have a friend\\\\u2019s permissionIf you have a friend or relative who wants to sign over a check to you, you must confirm with your bank that it will accept it, as not all will. You can improve the odds of your bank accepting the check by having your friend come with you to the bank to provide the teller with identification and consent.Your friend will have to endorse the back of the check and write \\\\u201cpay to the order of\\\\u201d and your name on the endorsement area.You have a joint accountIf you have a joint account with your spouse or partner, the bank can require that both of you sign the check if it\\\\u2019s made out to two people.If the check is written out to just one person, either person can cash or deposit the check into the account.You\\\\u2019re cashing a check on behalf of a minor or someone under your legal guardianshipIf your child is a minor and receives a check, you can cash it on their behalf. However, you must specify your relationship to your child on the check and sign your own name.In the endorsement area, print the child\\\\u2019s name and add a hyphen and the word \\\\u201cminor.\\\\u201d Under that line, print your own name, add a hyphen, and describe your relationship to the child. For example, \\\\u201cparent,\\\\u201d \\\\u201cguardian,\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cfather.\\\\u201d Sign your name under that line.Many banks prohibit mobile deposits of third-party checks, even if it\\\\u2019s a parent cashing a check on behalf of a minor, so you may need to visit a bank in person.You have power of attorneyWhether you\\\\u2019re helping an elderly parent or a relative who is in the military and serving overseas, you may have power of attorney (POA) to handle their financial affairs.As the POA, you can manage matters on their behalf, including depositing or cashing checks. Typically, the POA is added as an agent to the account. But can you deposit someone else\\\\u2019s check in your account online? Generally, you can as long as you are listed as an agent on the account.If you have POA and need to cash a check written out to your relative, print their name in the endorsement area. Under it, print your own name and your role as agent or POA, then add your signature.When you need to cash or deposit the check, you may need to bring a copy of the POA form if you aren\\\\u2019t a listed agent with that particular bank.You need to deposit a check made out to a deceased relativeIf you are the executor of the deceased\\\\u2019s estate, you may be able to cash or deposit the check for particular purposes, such as payments for tax refunds or goods and services they purchased prior to their death.However, if an executor was not named, the check cannot be cashed or deposited; it must be returned to the certifying agency and you must wait until the probate process is complete.You have to cash a check written out to your businessIf you run a business under a different name than your own, you can usually still cash it, but you\\\\u2019ll have to endorse it on behalf of the business.In the endorsement area, sign the name of the business, sign your name, and write your title. For example, you might write \\\\u201cOwner\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cCEO.\\\\u201dWhen you can\\\\u2019t deposit someone else\\'s checkAlthough depositing a check written in someone else\\\\u2019s name is possible, there are some legal issues you should be aware of first.If you deposit a check with someone else listed as the payee without proper endorsement, the bank could flag the check as fraudulent. Check fraud or forgeries are serious issues \\\\u2014 depending on the check amount, those offenses can be misdemeanors or felonies \\\\u2014 and cashing someone else\\\\u2019s check without their permission can have significant legal consequences.Risks associated with depositing someone else\\'s checkCashing third-party checks can be risky. Depending on the circumstances, you could face the following issues:Delayed funds: With third-party checks, the bank could take more time to verify the check and put a hold on the funds. If you rely on that money to cover your bills, that delay can be a costly problem.Overdraft fees: Banks have to make deposits available quickly. A check may be cleared, but if it turns out later to be a bad check, you\\\\u2019re responsible for the funds. You could incur serious overdraft fees along with the lost money.Damaged relationships: Before cashing a check, be sure you have your friend\\'s or relative\\\\u2019s express permission. Ideally, they\\\\u2019d accompany you to the bank or provide a written statement. Otherwise, you risk damaging your relationship if they feel you wrongfully cashed the check.Common check-cashing scamsA common scam involves a scammer signing over a check to you to deposit, usually for more than they owe you.For example, a remote job listing may promise upfront payment and send you a check for more than the promised amount. Your \\\\u201cboss\\\\u201d may ask you to use some of the money to buy electronic gift cards you send them. The check turns out to be bad so you have to repay that money, and the scammer makes off with the gift cards.If you\\\\u2019re a victim of a fake check scam, contact the Federal Trade Commission and your state\\\\u2019s attorney general.Alternatives to depositing someone else\\'s checkCan you deposit someone else\\'s check in your account? Yes, but it can be more complicated than depositing a check written out to you. Some banks prohibit it, and there are some risks involved.Instead, consider these alternatives:Be patient: Have the payee cash the check in their name. Once it clears, they can transfer the funds to you or write you a check in your name. This approach will take longer, but there\\\\u2019s less of a chance of issues.Get added to the account: Many banks will allow you to add a trusted individual to an account and get check deposit or cashing privileges.Open a joint account: If you frequently have to cash a check on behalf of a child, open a kid\\\\u2019s checking account. These accounts require a parent to be on the account too, which will allow you to cash or deposit checks.Explore other payment options: Consider peer-to-peer payment services like Venmo or Zelle rather than signing over checks. They\\\\u2019re quick and easy to use, and don\\\\u2019t require you to jump through hoops like you have with third-party checks.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Kat Tretina\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is a checking account?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/what-is-a-checking-account-210520837.html\",\"Article Content\":\"According to the 2021 FDIC National Survey of Underbanked and Unbanked Households, approximately 96% of US adults have a savings or checking account. Checking accounts are one of the most common deposit accounts available, and you can open one at many banks and credit unions. These accounts offer a convenient way to pay bills and track and manage your daily spending.If you\\\\u2019d like to open a new checking account, here\\\\u2019s what to know about these accounts, how they work, and how to use and manage them effectively.Understanding checking accountsA checking account is a deposit account that\\\\u2019s available at numerous financial institutions. Whereas a savings account is often used to set aside money for specific financial goals, a checking account is primarily used for everyday spending. Generally, checking accounts come with debit card access and check-writing privileges, making it easy to access the funds in your account when needed. These accounts often have no or low minimum balance requirements.While most checking accounts aren\\\\u2019t interest-bearing, meaning your balance won\\\\u2019t earn money, some do earn interest. However, interest rates are typically lower than what you\\\\u2019d see with a savings account. Unlike many traditional checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts may require maintaining a set minimum balance to earn interest.Banks and credit unions sometimes offer special bonuses for opening a new checking account and meeting specific requirements. For instance, if you deposit $1,500 and set up direct deposit to your new account in the first 60 days, your bank might give you $200.Some checking accounts may come with fees. For example, overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees are relatively common, so be mindful of this as you compare options.Opening a checking accountOpening a new checking account is typically straightforward, but your financial institution will require some information and documentation from you. Here\\\\u2019s what you\\\\u2019ll likely need to provide:NameAddressSocial Security number (SSN), Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), US passport, driver\\\\u2019s license, or another document to confirm your identityUtility bill, mortgage statement, or another document to confirm your addressOpening deposit, which is generally a small amountMany credit unions and banks let you open checking accounts online, but you could also open one over the phone or in person, depending on the institution. Before you start, look for checking accounts offering bonuses, as a decent bonus could be a relatively easy way to earn some extra cash.Using a checking accountAs mentioned, checking accounts typically come with debit cards and check-writing privileges. Depending on the merchant, you can make payments with both your debit card and checks. Many checking accounts also let you set up online bill pay, one-time or recurring. For instance, you might choose to automatically pay your monthly gas and electric bills from your checking account.If you need cash, you can withdraw funds from your checking account at a local branch or by using your debit card at an ATM, no matter if the ATM is in your bank\\\\u2019s network or not. But remember that you might pay a fee for using an out-of-network ATM. You can deposit checks and cash into your checking account in person, in-network ATMs, or via mobile deposit (if your bank supports this option).Managing a checking accountBefore online banking\\\\u2019s prevalence, people balanced their checkbooks on paper using a check register each month. With a check register, you write down every payment you make with a check and reconcile your expenses at the end of your statement cycle. While it\\\\u2019s still possible to track check payments this way, getting an accurate picture of your balance is more challenging if you also frequently make debit card payments.For this reason, many people manage their checking accounts via an online dashboard or bank and credit union mobile apps. These tools allow you to quickly and easily view your balance and track and reconcile your spending through monthly account statements. Mobile apps also offer convenient features like low balance warnings and transaction alerts, which can help you avoid overdrafting your account.Overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees (NSF) are common with checking accounts, and these fees are generally comparable. For instance, your bank may charge a $35 overdraft fee if you overdraw your account or a $35 NSF fee if you\\\\u2019ve opted out of overdraft protection. These fees typically apply if you make a purchase with your debit card and your checking account balance can\\\\u2019t cover the cost.Fortunately, managing your transactions effectively and tracking your balance closely can help you avoid fees. For added protection, you can generally link your checking account to another deposit account, such as a savings or money market account. If you accidentally overdraw your checking account, the difference can be taken out of your linked account.In addition to overdraft and NSF fees, certain checking accounts may also have monthly service fees. These fees are generally small but can still add up over time. Ideally, choosing a checking account with no monthly service fees is best.Alternatives to checking accountsAlternative options are available if a checking account doesn\\\\u2019t sound like the best fit for your financial situation. Instead, you may want to consider the following:Savings accounts: A savings account may be better if you\\\\u2019d prefer to build an emergency fund, save for a specific goal, or seek a higher interest rate than a checking account provides. These accounts often have monthly withdrawal limits and typically don\\\\u2019t come with debit cards or checks.Money market accounts: Money market accounts have rates comparable to savings accounts but come with debit card access and checks. Monthly withdrawal limits may apply with a money market account.Prepaid debit cards: Prepaid debit cards are another alternative if you prefer not to open a new bank account. With a prepaid card, you can spend up to the amount you add to the card. Once you\\\\u2019ve spent your card\\\\u2019s balance, you can opt to reload it. These cards can be a useful alternative to cash but typically have high fees.Find the best checking account rates\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Jess Ullrich\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Checking vs. savings accounts: What\\\\u2019s the difference?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/checking-vs-savings-account-103047755.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Checking accounts and savings accounts offer different benefits and limitations, and you\\\\u2019ll probably need both to manage your money.

You can use a savings account for:Building and maintaining an emergency savings fundSaving for a trip or big-ticket item, a vacation, or a big eventStashing money for medical expenses or other needsSome institutions limit how many transactions you can make monthly, which is a reason not to use a savings account for bill payments and other day-to-day financial needs.All savings accounts offer interest on your money, but the rate varies widely depending on the bank. High-yield savings accounts \\\\u2014 most often available through online-only banks \\\\u2014 can offer interest rates that are many times higher. Once your savings account reaches an amount sufficient to cover emergencies and near-term expenses, consider stashing money somewhere with better returns.Savings accounts also often charge monthly fees unless you meet certain conditions, such as putting in place an automatic transfer from your checking account or maintaining a minimum balance. It\\\\u2019s important to compare savings accounts to find the best interest rate and minimize the impact of fees.Check out the latest HYSA rates!How to choose a checking accountMost banks, credit unions, and online financial institutions offer checking accounts. Here are some things to consider when choosing a checking account.Easy application and sign up. Some banks and credit unions allow online account creation, which you can often do in minutes. A requirement to open an account in person is not a red flag, but if convenience is important, it could be a factor.Few to no fees. Many checking accounts come with fees but also offer ways you can avoid them. For instance, directly depositing your paycheck is a common way to get some or all checking account fees waived. There are others, and you should read the fine print or ask a representative to find out exactly how the account fees work. Other fees to watch out for include overdraft, monthly maintenance, and nonsufficient funds fees, among others.Insured and protected. Be sure the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) insures your account. If your bank or credit union fails, your money is insured up to $250,000. Additionally, some banks will cover any losses from fraudulent use of your debit card, a convenient protection if your card is lost or stolen.Other important factors to consider:Physical branch. You may appreciate the convenience of visiting a local bank branch if you need to speak to someone in person about your account.Customer service and a mobile app. A powerful and easy-to-use app and a well-designed website can make banking much more convenient. Visit the website and read app store reviews to determine the bank\\\\u2019s online offerings. You should also check the account\\\\u2019s security provisions, and ensure customer service is available 24\\\\/7 on the telephone or through online chat.Multiple accounts. The ability to link multiple accounts is a valuable feature. It\\\\u2019s convenient; often linking your savings account to your checking account can be a tool to avoid overdrafts.How to choose a savings accountHere are some important factors to consider when choosing a savings account.APY. The higher the annual percentage yield, or APY, the more interest you earn on the money in your account. High-yield savings accounts offer higher APYs than traditional savings accounts.Account requirements. Some banks have a high minimum initial deposit to qualify for the highest APY or even open an account. Make sure you\\\\u2019re eligible for an account before you try to open one.Promotions and bonuses. Some banks offer promotions such as a cash bonus if you deposit a set amount within the first few weeks of opening an account or a high introductory APY that can boost your interest earnings for an introductory period.Fees and penalties. Check for minimum balance, nonsufficient funds, and other fees, and be sure you understand them and how to avoid them.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Dori Zinn\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Where are the routing and account numbers on a check?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/where-are-routing-and-account-numbers-on-check-145645481.html\",\"Article Content\":\"If you have a checking account, chances are you also have a checkbook.

Own an antique tractor or exotic sports car for pleasure use? Maybe you\\\\u2019re tinkering with a WWII Army Jeep to drive in parades?Classic car insurance, one of many specialized types of auto insurance, is what you\\\\u2019ll need to protect your investment.What is classic car insurance?Classic car insurance policies recognize the intangibles that make older or collector vehicles valuable \\\\u2014 typically far more valuable than the day they rolled off the showroom floor. For the insurance to remain affordable, however, classic car insurance provides less coverage than standard auto insurance. For example, it won\\\\u2019t cover the car if it\\\\u2019s used for regular transportation or is not securely stored.That means collector car insurance is best for valuable cars that are rarely driven.What makes a car a collector car?According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), there is no uniform definition of a classic, collectible or antique car. \\\\u201cIf a car\\\\u2019s value exceeds its original selling price, then it might be considered collectible and a candidate for specialized classic car insurance,\\\\u201d says the III. This could include:Antique vehicles and vintage cars that are more than 25 years oldHot rods, muscle cars, and modified vehiclesExotic and luxury carsVintage military vehicles, antique tractors and classic trucksClassic motorcyclesSome classic car replicasMileage limits for classic car insuranceSome insurers set mileage caps with options for 2,500, 5,000 or 7,500 annual miles, and nearly all limit usage to enthusiast meetings and exhibits, tours and occasional pleasure driving, which has the same effect.Classic car insurance vs a standard auto policyClassic car insurance is similar to regular auto insurance in that it offers coverage for property damage and bodily injury liability, up to set amounts and with agreed-upon deductibles. But the similarities pretty much end there.With classic car insurance, your car must qualify as a collectible and be treated as such, meaning there are limits on where it can be driven and stored. For example, you may have to have a garage.In addition, while regular car insurance covers a car\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cactual cash value,\\\\u201d which is factors in the depreciation of that make, model and year, classic car insurance policies use an \\\\u201cagreed-upon value,\\\\u201d which considers the appreciated price that your specific car would fetch at a collector\\\\u2019s auction. Classic car insurance may also help pay for hard-to-find replacement parts and spare parts and provide roadside assistance.Can you insure a classic car as a daily driver?No. Any car used for regular errands and commutes requires a standard auto insurance policy. Classic auto insurance excludes daily driving and typically limits where or how much you can drive the car. Some insurers even require proof that you own another car for daily use.Classic car insurance coverage is designed to offer affordable insurance for vehicles that would be exceptionally costly to replace. Since daily driving increases the risk of an accident, insurers are able to reduce the cost of collector\\\\u2019s car insurance by limiting usage. In fact, Hagerty.com, a company that specializes in classic car insurance, cites daily use as a central definition of a classic vehicle, saying, \\\\u201cif it isn\\'t a vehicle you drive for your everyday transport, Hagerty can protect it.\\\\u201dWhat is the mileage limit for classic car insurance?Some insurers set mileage caps with options for 2,500, 5,000 or 7,500 annual miles, and nearly all limit usage to enthusiast meetings and exhibits, tours and occasional pleasure driving, which has the same effect.Does insurance restrict who can drive a classic car?Insurers typically sell collector car policies only to experienced drivers with good driving records. This further reduces the risk of an accident and a costly claim. It is common that the named insured must be at least 25, with no moving violations within the last three or five years. Policies also typically require that the owner, as well as all licensed drivers in the household, have a regular-use vehicle with standard insurance.Is classic car insurance cheaper?Classic car insurance is typically a good deal cheaper than standard car insurance. By limiting who can drive the car and how much, insurers are able to dramatically reduce the risk of an accident.Hagerty says its classic car premiums are 34% lower, on average, than daily driver premiums. American Collectors Insurance advertises its classic policies as up to 40% less than standard policies. Bailey Insurance says its collector car policies typically run between $200 and $600 per year unless the car has a very high value, compared with more than $1,000 annually for standard car insurance.What is stated value insurance?Stated value is what is used in standard insurance policies. If your car is a total loss, the insurer pays the actual cash value of the car at the time it\\\\u2019s totaled. Actual or stated value does not consider the collector\\\\u2019s value, and older cars are generally worth less and less with each passing year.Classic cars typically are insured for \\\\u201cagreed-upon value,\\\\u201d which is the amount that you and the insurer agree the car would be worth at auction. If you make improvements to the car, you can negotiate a new agreed value.How do I get collector car insurance?Most auto insurance companies offer classic car policies for some types of classic cars, and you may be able to get a multiline discount if you use your existing insurer. But insurance companies that specialize in collector cars are more likely to cover your unique car and to offer a broader array of policy options. These include Hagerty, American Collectors Insurance, American Modern Insurance Group and Grundy Insurance.Just as you should when shopping for any auto policy, seek multiple car insurance quotes for this type of coverage. A classic car policy should be affordable while giving you peace of mind that your unique investment is protected.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Karen Aho\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is non-owners car insurance?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/non-owners-car-insurance-180243621.html\",\"Article Content\":\"If you don\\\\u2019t own a vehicle, you might assume that you don\\\\u2019t need to purchase your own car insurance coverage. However, for some occasional drivers, a policy known as non-owners auto insurance can be a smart idea.Here\\\\u2019s a look at what non-owners car insurance policies are, what sort of coverage they offer, and how to choose the right policy for you and your needs.Understanding non-owners car insurance policiesA non-owners insurance policy is a type of auto insurance coverage for drivers using a vehicle they don\\\\u2019t own. These policies are reserved for drivers who don\\\\u2019t have their own vehicle and therefore aren\\\\u2019t required to buy their own separate coverage.Unlike your options for a standard car insurance policy, buying auto insurance without a car comes with more limitations. While a typical full coverage auto policy includes liability insurance, collision coverage, and comprehensive insurance, non-owners insurance provides you with only basic liability protection. That means that in the event of an accident, it won\\\\u2019t cover damage to the vehicle you\\'re driving or your own injuries.As with standard policies, you may also be able to purchase supplemental medical payments coverage, personal injury protection (PIP), and uninsured\\\\/underinsured motorist coverage with your non-owners policy. The exact coverage options and features available will depend on your state and the carrier you choose.Who should consider purchasing non-owners insurance policies?If you don\\\\u2019t own a vehicle, you aren\\\\u2019t legally required to purchase an auto insurance policy in any state. In fact, you can\\\\u2019t buy a standard policy if you don\\\\u2019t own a vehicle to attach it to. But if you drive on occasion, a non-owners auto insurance policy provides a good layer of protection.You may want to consider buying a non-owners policy if you:Frequently rent or borrow vehicles from othersDrive regularly but don\\\\u2019t have consistent access to one particular carWant to maintain continuous coverage (to avoid a coverage gap), even when you don\\\\u2019t own a carAre in a transition period, such as moving to a new location or waiting on a vehicle you\\\\u2019ve orderedSo, do you need insurance to drive someone else\\\\u2019s car? No, you don\\\\u2019t. That owner\\\\u2019s policy will follow their vehicle and, with few exceptions, the coverage will still protect you from liability while you\\\\u2019re behind the wheel, as long as they\\\\u2019ve given you permission to drive.However, even with someone else\\\\u2019s coverage, you might not be protected enough.What does non-owners car insurance cover?Non-owners auto insurance provides you, the driver, with your own liability coverage while you\\\\u2019re driving someone else\\\\u2019s vehicle, whether borrowed or rented. It includes bodily injury liability and property damage liability to cover other drivers\\\\u2019 losses if you are responsible for an accident.Depending on the state and the car owner\\\\u2019s coverage options and limits, your non-owners policy may act as secondary coverage. This means that it would only kick in if the owner\\\\u2019s policy doesn\\\\u2019t cover the property damage or bodily injuries in an at-fault accident. In this case, your non-owner policy will kick in to pay for damage that exceeds the vehicle owner\\\\u2019s coverage limits.You may also choose to add underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage to a non-owners insurance policy. This optional coverage protects you personally if you\\\\u2019re involved in an accident for which you are not-at-fault. If the other driver doesn\\\\u2019t have insurance \\\\u2014 or their policy\\\\u2019s liability limits aren\\\\u2019t enough to cover your expenses, medical bills, etc. \\\\u2014 then this coverage will step in to pay the difference.Lastly, some non-owners insurance policies will even allow you to add many of the same features and options as a standard policy, such as rental car insurance or roadside assistance. Even if you don\\\\u2019t own a vehicle, this coverage can be utilized to provide you with an alternate vehicle if your rental (or the car you usually borrow) is wrecked, or even dispatch help if you\\\\u2019re stranded on the side of the road.How much does non-owners car insurance cost?Non-owners policies typically cost less than a standard liability policy. While actual costs vary based on your driving history, the state where you live and other factors, most people can purchase a non-owner policy for a few hundred dollars a year. Of course, high-risk drivers and those with a spotty driving record that includes multiple infractions will pay more.Most major car insurance companies offer non-owners policies. To ensure you get the best price, you can get a quote directly from different carriers to compare insurance rates, contact an insurance agent to shop around for you or use an online tool.Factors to consider when choosing a non-owners policyIf you decide to purchase non-owners insurance coverage, there are a few factors to consider:Coverage limits and deductibles. Since this coverage will be secondary in many situations, you may not want limits as high as if you owned a vehicle. On the other hand, you might prefer high coverage limits to give you maximum financial protection no matter what you drive.Provider reputation and financial stability. By analyzing consumer reviews and complaints, a carrier\\\\u2019s reputation for processing claims, and even their financial stability (through agencies like AM Best), you can get a good idea of which auto insurance companies will pay out when necessary and remain solvent.Cost of premiums and payment options. Perhaps the biggest consideration when buying any insurance policy is the cost. It\\\\u2019s important to balance the coverage options you choose with how much you can afford to spend. You may also want to see what payment options the carrier offers; some will allow you to pay premiums in monthly installments while others may offer a discount if you pay your full six-month premium upfront.No matter which insurance policy you choose, read your policy documents carefully to understand the terms, coverages and any exclusions.When non-owners car insurance may not be necessaryWith all this said, a non-owners insurance policy isn\\\\u2019t right for everyone. In some cases, it may be insufficient while in others, this coverage could be redundant.Drivers who probably don\\\\u2019t need to buy non-owners insurance include:Individuals who own a vehicle and already have a standard auto insurance policyDrivers who have regular access to a household vehicle and are listed as a named insured or allowed driver on another policyDrivers who use employer-provided coverage and only engage in business-related drivingThose with access to commercial car-sharing services or rental programs, which offer their own insurance protectionA non-owners auto insurance policy can be a great option for occasional drivers who don\\\\u2019t own a vehicle, to provide added financial and personal protection each time you get behind the wheel of a borrowed or rented car. While this coverage is more limited than a standard auto policy, it can still offer you a combination of liability, medical payments, PIP and uninsured\\\\/underinsured motorist protection to give you peace of mind on the road.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Stephanie Colestock\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Can you change your student loan repayment plan?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/can-you-change-your-student-loan-repayment-plan-161131045.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Federal student loans default to a standard repayment term of 10 years. But depending on your financial situation, you may want to adjust your repayment plan to make your monthly payment more affordable or to position yourself for student loan forgiveness.If you need a little more flexibility with your student loans, here\\'s what you need to know.Can you change your student loan repayment plan?Yes, it\\'s possible to change your student loan repayment plan, especially if you have federal student loans. Some of the reasons to consider adjusting your repayment plan include:Your income has decreased.Your expenses have increased.You\\'re applying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.You want to consolidate multiple loans into one.You\\'re already on a longer repayment plan and want to pay off your debt more quickly.Federal student loan repayment plan optionsStudent loan repayment plans range from 10 to 30 years, with some tying your monthly payment to your income and household size. Here\\'s a breakdown of the options that are available to you.Standard repayment planThe default repayment plan for federal student loans is 10 years. However, if you use the direct loan consolidation program to combine multiple loans into one, you can extend that to up to 30 years.The standard repayment plan is available to all federal loan borrowers, and you can even switch back to it if you\\'ve chosen a longer repayment plan in the past.Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loansDirect consolidation loansGraduated repayment planIf your income is low now, but you expect regular increases, the graduated repayment plan can be a good option. Payments start out low and increase, usually every two years, to ensure that you pay off the loan within 10 years \\\\u2014 though you can go as long as 30 years with a consolidation loan.Anyone can apply for a graduated repayment plan. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loansDirect consolidation loansExtended repayment planIf you have more than $30,000 in outstanding federal direct loan debt, you can use the extended repayment plan to stretch your term to 25 years \\\\u2014 payments can be fixed or graduated. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loansDirect consolidation loansSaving on a Valuable Education plan (SAVE)Formerly the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan, the SAVE plan is an income-driven repayment plan.On this plan, your monthly payments will be 5% of your discretionary income, which is the difference between your adjusted gross income (AGI) and 225% of the federal poverty guideline for your household size and state of residence.If your AGI is below that threshold, your monthly payment will be $0. What\\'s more, if your resulting payment isn\\'t enough to cover accruing interest on the loan, those charges won\\'t be added to your balance.Finally, if your original loan balance was $12,000 or less, you qualify for forgiveness after 10 years on the SAVE plan. That timeline extends by one year for each additional $1,000 borrowed \\\\u2014 for example, a $15,000 original balance qualifies for forgiveness after 13 years.If you were on the REPAYE plan before the student loan repayment pause began in March 2020, you\\'ll be automatically enrolled in the SAVE plan. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansDirect PLUS loans made to studentsDirect consolidation loans that did not repay any PLUS loans made to parentsNote that if you have federal Stafford loans, you can consolidate them into the direct loan program and qualify.Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE)Under the PAYE plan, your monthly payments will be 10% of your discretionary income, which is the difference between your AGI and 150% of the federal poverty guideline. However, your payment is guaranteed to never be higher than your payment on the standard repayment plan.If you still have a balance after 20 years, the remaining amount will be forgiven. To qualify, you must be a new student loan borrower on or after Oct. 1, 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a direct loan on or after Oct. 1, 2011. You also typically need to have a high debt burden relative to your income. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansDirect PLUS loans made to studentsDirect consolidation loans that did not repay any PLUS loans made to parentsIncome-Based Repayment Plan (IBR)Another income-driven repayment plan, the IBR plan is designed for borrowers who have a high debt amount relative to their income.The plan reduces your monthly payment to 10% of your discretionary income \\\\u2014 the difference between your AGI and 150% of the poverty guideline \\\\u2014 if you received your first loans on or after July 1, 2014, and 15% if you received your first loan before that.Additionally, if you still have a balance after 20 years (or 25 if you received your first loan before July 1, 2014), the remaining amount will be forgiven. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loans made to studentsDirect consolidation loans that did not repay any PLUS loans made to parentsIncome-Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR)The only income-driven repayment plan available to parents, the ICR plan reduces your monthly payment to the lesser of 20 percent of discretionary income \\\\u2014 the difference between your AGI and 100% of the poverty guideline \\\\u2014 or the amount you would pay on a repayment plan with a fixed payment over 12 years, adjusted according to your income.If you still have a student loan balance after 25 years, the remaining amount will be forgiven.

Here are some potential scenarios to consider:You have a high income: The standard repayment plan may be the best option for you because it\\'s the quickest path to becoming debt-free.You\\'re struggling to keep up with payments: An income-driven repayment plan may be the better choice. Because the new SAVE plan offers a chance at the lowest monthly payment and the quickest path to forgiveness for borrowers with lower debt amounts, it\\'s best to start there to see what yours will look like.You\\'re a parent: If you took out parent PLUS loans and you\\'re having trouble making payments, consider consolidating your loans, so you can qualify for the ICR plan.You\\'re applying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness: The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers complete forgiveness after you make 120 qualifying monthly payments while working for a government agency or eligible not-for-profit organization. If you\\'re applying, get on an income-driven repayment plan, so you don\\'t risk paying off your debt before you meet the requirements. Compare monthly payments between the SAVE, PAYE and IBR plans to determine the best fit for you.How to change your student loan repayment planTo get more information about your options and switch to a new student loan repayment plan, contact your loan servicer. To find your loan servicer and its contact information, log in to your account at StudentAid.gov or check your latest statement.Before you do so, however, you can use the online federal student loan simulator to get an idea of which plans you\\'re eligible for and what your monthly payment will look like.Can you change your private student loan repayment plan?Generally, you can\\'t change your repayment plan on a private student loan once you\\'ve been approved. However, you can refinance your loans with another private lender, which can allow you to choose a new repayment term.That said, you\\'ll typically need good or excellent credit and a strong income to qualify for favorable terms on a student refinance loan. Otherwise, you may not get an interest rate that\\'s low enough to make the process worth it, even with a different repayment plan.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Mon, Sep 11, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to switch car insurance companies\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/how-to-switch-car-insurance-194505669.html\",\"Article Content\":\"If the idea of switching to a new car insurance company has crossed your mind in recent months, you\\\\u2019re not alone. Almost one-third of auto insurance customers in the United States experienced a rate increase in the past year, according to J.D. Power, leaving consumers deeply dissatisfied with their car insurance costs.The good news is that if you\\\\u2019re unhappy with your current insurer, you can change your auto insurance at any time. Below are some simple steps you can follow to change car insurance carriers, along with the pros and cons of making a change.General considerations before leaving your current providerPerhaps the most common reason customers switch insurers is to get a better rate. However, you might also be motivated to shop for new auto insurance due to different coverage needs or for customer service reasons.Before you begin to gather quotes and compare rates from different insurers, it\\\\u2019s important to assess the types of car insurance you have (e.g., liability insurance, collision insurance, comprehensive insurance, etc.). You should also review the coverage amounts you carry on your current policy and your deductibles. From there, you can evaluate if the coverage you have satisfies your current needs or if you want to consider new coverage options.Be thorough in your research of any new car insurance companies you consider. Make sure your new insurance provider is reputable and reliable.Reasons and timing for switching car insuranceWhether you\\\\u2019ve been with your current insurance provider for years or months, you can switch car insurance companies whenever you like. Certain times may be more convenient than others, and some life events may prompt you to switch.You may want to consider changing car insurance companies if:Your renewal date is approaching: Switching insurance providers on your old policy\\\\u2019s expiration date could be ideal. This strategy might help you avoid cancellation fees, having to pay for double coverage, and waiting for refunds on the former policy.You\\\\u2019re adding or removing a driver: Anytime you need to add a driver to your policy, especially a teen driver, it\\\\u2019s worth seeing if a competitor can offer you a lower rate. Removing a driver may also be a good time to switch auto insurance providers. As your insurance needs change, you might find more affordable or better coverage elsewhere.You purchase a home: When you buy a home, you\\\\u2019ll most likely buy a homeowners policy at the same time. Many insurance providers offer discounts to customers who bundle their homeowners and auto insurance policies. (The same may be true for renters insurance.) So, if you\\\\u2019re shopping for a new insurance policy for your home, it may be a good time to think about switching your car insurance coverage too.You move to a new city or state: Insurance rates can vary widely from one location to another. Furthermore, different states often have different insurance companies doing business. Anytime you relocate, it could be a good time to see if a different insurance carrier might be able to offer you a better rate based on your new location.Switching insurance providers in the middle of a coverage period has the potential to save you money or upgrade your coverage. But be careful not to cancel your original auto insurance policy too soon when changing carriers. It\\\\u2019s better to pay for an extra month of coverage on your existing policy than to risk a lapse in coverage\\\\u2014aka being without any insurance coverage before your new policy kicks in.Ready to change? Here\\\\u2019s howWhen you\\\\u2019re ready, the process of switching your policy should be simple. Here are three easy steps to follow.1. Shop around for new rates. Compare car insurance rates and premiums from multiple insurance companies before you make a change in coverage. You can call around for car insurance quotes, contact an insurance agent to shop new policies on your behalf, or use online tools to search for the best rates based on your details (e.g., location, vehicle, coverage needs, etc.). Don\\\\u2019t forget to look for available car insurance discounts that might help you save even more.2. Establish a new policy. Once you find an offer for auto insurance coverage that you like, you can move forward with setting up a new policy. Be sure to read over the details (both coverage amounts and rate) to make sure they match your quote. Your new auto insurance provider may also have forms that you need to sign and you may need to put down a deposit to establish new coverage. Be sure to obtain proof of insurance from your new provider.3. Cancel your old policy. Before you contact your old insurance company to cancel your old auto policy, it\\\\u2019s important to verify that your new auto insurance is active. If you skip this step, you risk having a gap in coverage that could result in penalties from your state. Note that if you\\\\u2019re switching in the middle of a coverage period, your old insurance company might owe you a partial refund. However, you could also owe an early cancellation penalty depending on the terms of your policy.4. Update your lender. When you lease or finance a vehicle, you agree to maintain car insurance as part of your loan or lease agreement. So it\\\\u2019s important to notify the lender or leasing company when you change auto insurance providers. You might face negative consequences (and even a potential repossession in extreme circumstances) if your lender believes your vehicle is uninsured.When to think twice about changing insuranceAlthough you always want to have the best rate for your coverage, in certain situations it could be wise to wait before changing insurance companies.During an active insurance claimAlthough you can typically change car insurance companies at any time, switching providers in the middle of an active insurance claim isn\\\\u2019t ideal.When you switch insurance companies during the claims process, you might experience:Future rate increase: A new insurance provider may have a hard time properly pricing your new policy during an outstanding claim. Until your claim is complete, the company won\\\\u2019t have all the information it needs to assess your risk level as a customer (aka the risk of you filing a new claim that would cost the insurer money). In this situation, you might face a significant premium increase when your policy renews.Policy cancellation: There\\\\u2019s also a risk that your new provider might decide to cancel your new car insurance policy after your claim is complete. If you were dishonest or failed to inform the company about an outstanding at-fault claim, a policy cancellation may be more likely to occur. In extreme circumstances of insurance fraud, the insurance company might take legal action against you.If you do change car insurance providers in the middle of a claim, you\\\\u2019ll still have to deal with your original insurance company until the claim is finalized. In general, it\\\\u2019s best to wait until any outstanding claims are resolved before you switch to a new provider.After a DUI or accidentIf you\\\\u2019ve had a series of at-fault accidents or a DUI conviction, it may be more challenging to find auto insurance companies that are willing to work with you (or to offer you competitive car insurance premiums).If you\\\\u2019re in this situation, you should start researching auto insurance providers in your area that specialize in high-risk insurance (sometimes called SR-22 insurance) ASAP. Your current provider may increase your premiums significantly at your next renewal date \\\\u2014 or drop you altogether.But even with a DUI or accidents on your driving record, you can take steps to reduce your insurance rates in the future. First, avoiding issues like additional DUI convictions, speeding, at-fault accidents, or lapses in insurance coverage is key. Taking a safe driving course might help you receive discounts from some insurance providers. And in some (though not all) states, DUI records may come off your driving record after five to 10 years.Canceling your old insuranceAfter you establish a new insurance policy (and confirm that it\\\\u2019s effective and you have your new insurance ID cards), it\\\\u2019s important to notify your former insurance company. You should submit a cancellation request in writing, but it\\\\u2019s fine to follow up with a phone call as well. If you don\\\\u2019t cancel your existing insurance coverage, you could wind up paying for two car insurance policies at once.(On the other hand, if you cancel your previous policy before the new one is fully in place your driver\\\\u2019s license could be canceled by your state DMV if it looks like you\\\\u2019re going without coverage. Make sure your new company notifies the state that you have the required coverage.)It\\\\u2019s also worth noting that you might have to pay early cancellation fees or penalties if you change insurers before your current policy expires. Nonetheless, you can typically switch insurance companies in the middle of a coverage period as long as you give your provider proper notice.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Michelle Lambright Black\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 8, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How does your ZIP code affect your car insurance?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/does-zip-code-affect-car-insurance-191204288.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Auto insurance companies use a number of criteria to determine car insurance rates. The type of vehicle you drive, your driving history, and the amount of coverage you desire all come into play.Insurers also use your ZIP code when issuing car insurance policies because where you live is associated with a particular level of risk. Areas with heavy congestion or bad road conditions can lead to increased car accidents. High-crime areas are also seen as risky to insurers because there can be a greater chance of you filing an auto theft claim.These are just a few examples of how an increased risk associated with your ZIP code can lead to higher auto insurance rates. The opposite is also true. If you live within a ZIP code that\\\\u2019s viewed as less risky to insure, you may benefit from lower rates.Why is your ZIP code important for insurance?Auto insurance companies want to make sure they are collecting more money in premiums than they are paying out in claims. If where you live is seen as having a greater likelihood of you filing auto insurance claims, the insurance company will typically give you a higher auto insurance rate to offset the money they may potentially need to pay out in claims.While the particular city and state you live in can help determine that risk, your ZIP code gives insurance companies a more specific picture of the risks that come along with insuring you.However, some states \\\\u2013 including California and Michigan \\\\u2013 have laws that prohibit insurance companies from using ZIP codes as a rating factor.Take note of garaging addressWhen you\\\\u2019re working with an insurance agent or trying to get a policy quote online, you may come across the term \\\\\"garaging address.\\\\\" Your garaging address is simply the primary place where your vehicle will be parked overnight \\\\u2013 even if it\\\\u2019s not actually in a garage.Insurers use your garaging address in the same way they use your ZIP code. Knowing the primary location for your vehicle helps auto insurance providers evaluate the risk associated with insuring your car.How insurance companies use ZIP codes to determine riskAuto insurance underwriters use the statistical data associated with your ZIP code to determine the risk of insuring your vehicle where you live.Some of the risk factors they might consider include:Average claims history in that ZIP codePopulation densityTraffic patternsAccident ratesRoad conditionsNatural disastersCrime rateThe amount of uninsured motoristsCost of livingNow, let\\\\u2019s dive a bit deeper into these location-related risk factors.8 risk factors for car insurance that vary by locationIf you live in an urban area, chances are you\\\\u2019re going to face higher car insurance prices than if you were to pack up and move to a rural area. Busy cities tend to have more people on the road causing accidents and higher crime rates, which might have insurance companies shelling out more money for instances of car theft or vandalism.Here\\\\u2019s what else insurance companies look at when determining the cost of car insurance premiums.1. Claims historyThe amount of auto insurance claims filed within your ZIP code can affect your premium. If drivers in your ZIP code tend to file more car insurance claims than average, insurance underwriters might issue more expensive policies.2. Population densityMore people living in an area generally leads to more cars on the road, more traffic congestion and higher accident rates. Auto insurance policies tend to be more expensive in high-density areas as a result.On the other hand, ZIP codes with a low population density usually have less occurrences of car accidents, and auto insurance policies in those areas tend to be cheaper.3. Traffic patternsAnother factor that impacts car accidents \\\\u2013 and thus, auto insurance claims \\\\u2013 within a ZIP code is traffic patterns.Roads with high speed limits, curvy roads with visibility issues, complicated intersections and unclear signage can all lead to higher rates of traffic accidents. Insurance companies would view those areas as riskier than places where traffic patterns promote safer driving outcomes.4. Road conditionsThe conditions of the roads themselves can affect your probability of filing auto insurance claims. Roads with potholes, rough surfaces, and debris can end up damaging vehicles or causing car accidents as drivers attempt to avoid the unsafe road conditions.Streets that flood easily during rain showers and roads that quickly turn icy in frigid temperatures are also hazardous and may lead to more accidents or vehicle damage. ZIP codes with many roads in poor or potentially dangerous conditions are considered more risky and can wind up costing drivers more in auto insurance premiums.5. Natural disastersLiving in regions prone to natural disasters \\\\u2013 including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, and blizzards \\\\u2013 can increase insurance costs because insurance companies typically have to pay out more money in claims following such an event. In an attempt to balance out the probability for increased claims, drivers in those areas typically have to pay more in insurance premiums.6. Crime rates and vandalismZIP codes with higher crime rates \\\\u2013 particularly when it comes to auto theft or auto vandalism \\\\u2013 are viewed as riskier to auto insurance companies.7. Amount of uninsured motoristsIf your ZIP code tends to have more uninsured motorists illegally on the roads, you can probably expect to pay more for your auto policy. If your vehicle is hit by an uninsured driver, there\\\\u2019s no insurance company to cover auto repairs or medical bills you might have as a result.8. Cost of livingPerhaps surprisingly, even cost of living can have an impact on your auto insurance premiums. If you live in an expensive ZIP code, you can likely expect to pay more at the auto body shop following an accident. The cost of medical care might also be higher than average.Insurance companies footing your repair bills or doctors\\\\u2019 bills can expect to pay more when claims are filed in high cost-of-living areas.How your location can affect your car insurance coverageYour auto insurance premiums are also affected by laws that set minimum coverage requirements in your state.For example, drivers in Texas are required to have liability insurance that covers $30,000 per person for injuries, $60,000 total for all injuries and $25,000 for property damage per accident. In Iowa, drivers must have liability coverage at $20,000 per person for injuries, $40,000 total for all injuries, and $15,000 for property damage.More coverage typically means higher car insurance costs for the driver.Even if your state doesn\\\\u2019t require it, you may choose to purchase more coverage \\\\u2013 such as comprehensive coverage or collision coverage \\\\u2013 so that you feel confident you won\\\\u2019t have to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket costs if you were to get into a car accident.Additionally, some states \\\\u2013 including Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York, plus a few more \\\\u2013 are no-fault car insurance states, meaning your insurance company pays injury-related expenses after a car accident regardless of who was at fault.Insurance policies for drivers in these no-fault car insurance states tend to be higher, because you can never count on another driver\\\\u2019s insurance company to pay for the costs associated with the car accident, even if they technically caused the accident.Other factors that affect car insurance ratesWhere you live is not the only factor that car insurance companies evaluate when issuing policies and setting insurance rates. Your vehicle type, driving history, age, and even your credit score are other determinants that can either place you in a preferred risk category or a high-risk category.Driving record and accident historyWhile you don\\\\u2019t have control over things like population density or the crime rate in your area, you do have some control over your own driving record. Practicing safe driving habits can reduce your chance of accidents on the road.Car insurers view drivers who have no car accidents, DUIs or traffic tickets on their record as being less risky to insure.Credit scoreStudies have shown there\\\\u2019s a correlation between credit score and the probability of filing car insurance claims. Drivers with excellent credit \\\\u2013 known as credit-based insurance scores \\\\u2013 tend to file fewer car insurance claims, while those with poor credit typically file more claims.Vehicle typeThe type of car you drive also impacts what you\\\\u2019ll pay in auto insurance. The costlier your car is to repair or replace \\\\u2013 or the increased likelihood that it\\\\u2019d be a target for car thieves \\\\u2013 the harder it will be to find cheap car insurance.Vehicle usageHow you use your vehicle is another thing insurance underwriters may consider. You\\\\u2019ll typically pay less if you don\\\\u2019t drive your car much compared to others who have long commutes or take frequent road trips.Navigating ZIP code-related challengesLiving in a ZIP code that insurers deem risky doesn\\\\u2019t mean you\\\\u2019re guaranteed to have to pay high auto insurance premiums. Here are six tips for getting affordable auto insurance in high-risk areas.1. Maintain stellar driving habitsPractice safe driving to avoid car accidents, so you can build up a history of no insurance claims. Taking a defensive driving course can also help you get lower car insurance rates.2. Improve your credit scoreInsurance companies correlate good credit with the likelihood of filing fewer auto insurance claims. Boost your credit history by paying bills on time and making increased debt payments.3. Compare car insurance quotes from multiple companiesAlways get quotes from multiple car insurance companies, so you can consider your options and nail down the best deal. You can work with insurance agents to help you compare costs or use online insurance calculators that give you a side-by-side comparison.4. Ask for available discountsMost major auto insurance companies offer discounts for things like bundling your auto and homeowners insurance, being a safe driver or enrolling in paperless billing with auto-pay. Contact your insurance company to ask about which discounts you might qualify for.5. Re-evaluate your coverage needsIf you have an older, paid-off vehicle and enough savings to cover repairs, you might not need full coverage on your vehicle. Assess your situation to determine the coverage levels you truly need.6. Adjust your deductible amountYour deductible \\\\u2013 the amount of money you\\\\u2019ll pay out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \\\\u2013 affects the cost of your insurance premiums. Generally, if you opt for a high deductible, you\\\\u2019ll pay a lower premium. However, you need to be prepared to pay out of pocket for any repair bills or medical bills if you get in a car accident.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Nicole Dow\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 8, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Buying a car?

After you\\\\u2019re done selecting the perfect set of wheels, you\\\\u2019ll need to focus on the less-exciting part: getting insurance for your new vehicle.The state you live in will require you to carry a minimum amount of car insurance. And if you finance or lease your new vehicle, the lender will require you to carry sufficient insurance to protect its investment as well.In some cases, you may be able to add your new car to your current policy. But if you didn\\\\u2019t trade or sell your former vehicle, you\\\\u2019ll need to add the new car to your existing policy or set up new coverage elsewhere.Below are helpful tips on how to insure a car that\\\\u2019s new to you. You\\\\u2019ll also discover how to compare car insurance coverage options and find the best deals for your situation.Can you switch insurance to a new car?When you buy a new vehicle, your existing car insurance should cover it at first \\\\u2014 usually with the same level of coverage you have on your old car. For this reason, an auto dealership may allow you to drive a new purchase off the lot if you show proof of current insurance and sign a form committing to insure the vehicle.Yet even in this scenario, you won\\\\u2019t have long to get a new policy in place.If you want to stick with your existing insurer, you should notify your insurance company as soon as possible after purchasing a vehicle. Some insurers may give you a grace period to add a new vehicle to your policy (such as if you buy a new car over the weekend). But if a grace period isn\\\\u2019t available, you\\\\u2019ll need to add your new car to your policy before leaving the dealership.If you trade in or sell your old car, you may be able to transfer your existing insurance coverage to your new vehicle. But remember to review the coverage options on your existing policy before making the change. Your former selections may not be the right fit for your new car. So it\\\\u2019s important to reassess how much car insurance you need now.It\\\\u2019s also wise to compare insurance quotes, policy options, and potential insurance discounts from several different providers. Rate shopping can help you make sure you\\\\u2019re getting the best deal for the type of coverage you want.If you\\\\u2019re confident that your current provider is offering a rate and amount of coverage that makes sense for your new vehicle purchase, you can move forward.When you transfer coverage to a new vehicle, your premium will likely change since the value of your new vehicle will differ from your old one. This is true even if you don\\\\u2019t adjust coverage amounts. Of course, if you change the types of insurance you carry (e.g., adding comprehensive car insurance when you had only liability coverage before) or the deductible on your insurance policy, those adjustments will affect your premium as well.Insuring a new car without previous coverageSome drivers may need to establish brand new car insurance when purchasing a vehicle. If you\\\\u2019re in this position, it\\\\u2019s important to secure adequate insurance before you drive your new car for the first time \\\\u2014 even if you\\\\u2019re paying in cash. If you attempt to drive without car insurance, you could put yourself at risk financially or worse, be in violation of state laws.How to get car insurance before you buy a carIt\\\\u2019s illegal to drive without insurance. But you can set up insurance coverage before you own a vehicle, such as a non-owner policy or insurance for the type of car you plan to purchase.As an alternative, you could also apply for a temporary car insurance binder before you purchase a new vehicle. A binder is a document you request from an insurer that serves as proof of insurance to lenders. This document can also satisfy legal insurance requirements until your formal auto policy is approved.When you contact an insurance agent and reach out to carriers directly to set up coverage for the first time, the car insurance quotes you receive will vary based on the type of coverage included. Here are some of the most common coverage options:Liability insurance\\\\u00a0pays for damage you cause to other vehicles along with medical expenses for drivers and passengers when you\\\\u2019re at fault in an accident. In almost all states, you need a minimum amount of liability coverage to legally drive.Comprehensive insurance is optional coverage that pays for certain types of damages to your personal vehicle that don\\\\u2019t involve a collision (e.g. theft, vandalism, storm damage, etc.). If you finance or lease your vehicle, the lender will typically require you to carry this type of coverage.Collision insurance can cover the cost of repairing or replacing your personal vehicle if someone steals it or you\\\\u2019re in an accident. If you finance or lease your vehicle, the lender will typically require you to carry this type of coverage.Personal injury protection (PIP) insurance can help pay for medical bills for yourself and your passengers in the event of a covered accident.Full coverage car insurance is an unofficial term to describe an auto insurance policy package including liability, comprehensive, and collision coverage \\\\u2014 sometimes more. In states where it\\\\u2019s required by law, full coverage also includes uninsured motorist coverage that kicks in when you\\\\u2019re in an accident with someone lacking enough coverage.The effective date of your new insurance typically begins as soon as you make your first payment. (Note: Depending on the date you purchase your policy and the insurer\\\\u2019s requirements, you might have to make two months worth of premium payments upfront.)This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Tips for getting the best car insurance for your new carInsuring a new vehicle may feel a bit overwhelming at first. These tips can help you make sure you get the coverage you need while keeping your insurance costs down.Shop around: Whatever type of insurance you decide to buy, it\\\\u2019s smart to get quotes from multiple insurance companies. Comparing auto insurance quotes (just as you should during the car shopping process) can be a great way to find affordable car insurance.Assess your coverage needs: Your insurance needs for a new car may differ from an older vehicle. Consider the value of your new vehicle (or the vehicle you plan to purchase) and how you plan to use the new car. A car you drive every day may require different coverage than a vehicle that will sit in your driveway most of the time. (Vehicles used in ridesharing have additional requirements.)Understand your state\\\\u2019s minimum car insurance requirements and coverage limits: Most states require you to carry basic liability insurance that covers other drivers if an accident takes place. But the minimum coverage limits (often noted as 25\\\\/50\\\\/25, or at least $25,000 per person you injure, $50,000 in injuries per accident, and $25,000 in property damage per accident) may not be enough to financially protect you in a major accident.Determine whether you need gap insurance: If you finance or lease your new car, your lender will probably require you to have gap insurance, which covers the gap between what the insurer would have to pay for your totaled or stolen vehicle and what you still owe on your auto loan. It\\\\u2019ll cost you a bit extra but save you from having to lay out cash for the balance of your loan if your car were totaled in an accident.Consider additional coverage: If you finance or lease your new car, the lender will require you to carry comprehensive and collision coverage. But even if you pay cash for your new purchase, you may want to consider adding on this additional coverage to protect your own financial investment. Extra features like roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement are also nice to have.Look for discounts: Many insurance companies offer discounts that can save you money. Bundling coverage (using the same company where you have homeowners or renters insurance), taking a defensive driving course, getting credit for good grades, or signing up for a telematics device to track your mileage are all discount opportunities. It\\\\u2019s also a good idea to look at the customer satisfaction ratings of any company you consider.Important documentation and information your insurer needsWhen you set up new car insurance (or switch your existing coverage over to a new vehicle), your insurance company will need some basic information, such as:Vehicle identification number (VIN)Title informationFinancing or leasing detailsDriver\\\\u2019s licenseVehicle inspection or appraisal (in certain circumstances)If you\\\\u2019re establishing a new insurance policy, the insurer may also review your credit (depending on your state of residence). In many states, your credit-based insurance score can impact the price you pay for auto insurance. Good credit has the potential to lower your car insurance rates while bad credit could make it more expensive to insure your vehicle.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Michelle Lambright Black\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 8, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How the Fed affects student loan interest rates\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/student-loan-interest-rates-212638277.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Student loan interest rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. But exactly how the Fed\\'s decision to raise or lower its federal funds rate affects you depends on the type of student loans and interest rate you have.If you\\'re concerned about rising interest rates or simply want to better understand how student loan interest works, here\\'s what you need to know.How does the Federal Reserve influence student loan interest rates?One of the purposes of the Federal Reserve is to help manage inflation in the U.S. economy. One way the central bank does this is by raising and lowering its federal funds rate \\\\u2014 commercial banks charge this rate when lending to each other to meet overnight cash reserve requirements.When the inflation rate exceeds the Fed\\'s 2% target and remains elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \\\\u2014 made up of the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors and select Reserve Bank presidents \\\\u2014 may increase the federal funds rate.The prime rate, a benchmark rate that banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions use to determine interest rates for certain loans and credit cards, typically follows suit. As borrowing becomes more expensive, consumer spending typically decreases, resulting in the inflation rate coming back down.Conversely, if the inflation rate is too low and the economy is sputtering, the FOMC may lower its interest rate, reducing the cost of borrowing money, which can result in more spending to enhance economic growth.Federal student loan interest ratesThe federal funds rate doesn\\'t directly impact federal student loan interest rates, but it can do so indirectly. Instead of using the prime rate, Congress determines interest rates for federal student loans each year using the 10-year Treasury bill, adding on a margin.The 10-year Treasury is not influenced by the federal funds rate. Instead, the yield on a 10-year Treasury bill is dictated by investor demand. When the inflation rate is high or investors anticipate high economic growth, they typically demand higher yields on long-term bonds, resulting in higher Treasury rates.On the flip side, Treasury rates typically fall when investors expect slow economic growth and prefer the safety of risk-free government bonds.If the FOMC successfully reduces inflation by manipulating the federal funds rate, the 10-year Treasury yield may also fall, resulting in lower federal student loan interest rates. Because federal student loans have fixed interest rates, the prime rate doesn\\'t come into play, and your interest rate won\\'t change after loan disbursement.Private student loan interest ratesPrivate student loans are offered by private lending institutions, which use the prime rate to help determine which interest rates to charge their borrowers. As the Fed\\'s interest rate increases, so will the interest rates offered on private student loans, and vice versa.But because you can opt for either a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate on a private student loan, the Fed\\'s decisions may impact you differently.If you opt for a fixed APR, your interest rate may be high if the federal funds rate is currently high, but it won\\'t change over time. In contrast, variable interest rates fluctuate based on market rates. In other words, your interest rate can go up or down over time, depending on market conditions.Interest rates for different types of student loansEach year, Congress determines interest rates on federal student loans for the entire academic year by taking the 10-year Treasury rate on a specific date in May and adding a margin, which varies by loan type. On May 10, 2023, the 10-year Treasury note high yield was set at 3.448%, with the following margins.Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students: 10-year Treasury yield plus 2.05% (fixed interest rate of 5.50%)Direct Unsubsidized Loans for professional students and graduate students: 10-year Treasury yield plus 3.60% (fixed interest rate of 7.05%)Direct PLUS loans for parents of undergrads and for professional students and graduate students: 10-year Treasury yield plus 4.60% (fixed interest rate of 8.05%)These interest rates are standardized within each program. If you apply for financial aid with a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application and qualify for a federal student loan, you\\'ll receive the same rate as everyone else who qualifies in the same year.On the other hand, private lenders determine interest rates using the prime rate and other benchmarks, as well as risk-based pricing. Instead of offering a standardized rate, they typically offer a range of interest rates, with the best student loan rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers and higher rates for borrowers with a higher risk of defaulting on payments.Current student loan interest ratesFor the 2023-24 school year, federal student loan interest rates are as follows:This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.As part of the Biden administration\\\\u2019s coronavirus pandemic relief efforts, interest on federal student loans stopped accruing in March 2020. However, it resumed on Sept. 1, 2023, and monthly payments will resume in October 2023.Among private lenders, interest rates can vary depending on the lender, your creditworthiness and the type of interest rate you choose. That said, the average fixed interest rate among top private student loan companies is 9.62% for undergraduate loans and 9.51% for graduate loans, as of August 2023.Student loan debt repayment plansThe U.S. Department of Education offers several different repayment plans for federal student loan borrowers. The repayment plan you choose won\\'t have any impact on your interest rate, but it can affect your total interest charges.The standard repayment plan on a federal student loan is 10 years, but if you extend it \\\\u2014 options go as high as 30 years \\\\u2014 you\\'ll ultimately pay more interest over the life of your loan.If you\\'re having trouble making payments on your federal student loans, you can opt for an income-driven repayment plan, which can reduce your monthly student loan payment to as little as 5% of your discretionary income. Depending on which plan you choose, you may also receive forgiveness of your remaining balance after a certain point, which can range from 10 to 25 years.However, if your monthly payment isn\\'t high enough to cover the accrued interest, three of the four income-driven repayment plans will add the remaining interest to your balance. The SAVE plan is the only one that doesn\\'t do this.Do credit scores and co-signers also affect your interest rate?You don\\'t need a minimum credit score or a co-signer to qualify for federal student loans. However, if you\\'re applying for private student loans, a bad credit score will likely prevent you from qualifying \\\\u2014 you typically need a credit score in the mid-600s or higher to get approved.Just because you qualify doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll get favorable terms \\\\u2014 student loan companies reserve their highest loan amounts and lowest rates for borrowers with credit scores in the mid-700s and higher.If you can\\'t qualify for a private student loan on your own, or you can\\'t get a low interest rate, you can improve your odds by adding a creditworthy co-signer to your application. A co-signer agrees to repay the loan if you can\\'t, so the lender will also consider their credit score and income during the application process.If you don\\'t have a potential co-signer, improving your credit score is your best bet to qualify for a lower rate on a private student loan. Steps you can take include:Checking your credit score to evaluate your overall credit health.Reviewing your credit reports to pinpoint areas you can address.Paying your bills on time and, if applicable, getting caught up on missed payments.Paying down high credit card balances.Paying off loans with low balances.Asking a loved one with good credit to add you as an authorized user on their credit card.Disputing inaccurate or fraudulent information on your credit reports.Will refinancing your student loans lower your interest rate?Student loan refinancing involves replacing your existing loans with a new one through a private lender. Depending on your situation, refinancing could allow you to get a lower interest rate or a different repayment plan. If you have several loans, you\\'ll also be able to consolidate them into one monthly payment going forward.If you have private student loans and can qualify for better terms with a refinance loan, there aren\\'t many downsides to refinancing. But if you have federal student loans, it\\'s important to consider what you\\'ll give up if you refinance them with a private lender. The process is irreversible and will result in you losing access to federal benefits, including student loan forgiveness and repayment assistance programs, income-driven repayment plans, and generous forbearance and deferment options.Unless you have a stable job and income and the potential savings are significant, it\\'s best to avoid refinancing federal student loans.Will you save money with student loan refinancing?Student loan refinancing can help you secure a lower monthly payment through a lower interest rate, a longer repayment term or both. But in instances where your new repayment term will be higher, you may wind up paying more in interest.As an example, let\\'s say you have $30,000 principal balance in private student loans with an average interest rate of 8%, a 10-year repayment term, and a monthly payment of roughly $364. If you qualify for a 6% interest rate and retain the 10-year repayment term, your new monthly payment will be about $333, and you\\'ll save $3,711 in interest charges over the life of the loan.If you get the 6% interest rate and extend your repayment term to 15 years, your monthly payment will drop even further to roughly $253, but you\\'ll end up paying about $1,890 more in interest on the new loan.In this instance, you\\'d need to consider the trade-offs of extending your loan term. If your budget is tight, a lower payment may be necessary but also more expensive in the long run. One way to mitigate the cost is to take advantage of the lower payment now, then once your financial situation has improved, refinance again with a shorter repayment term or make extra payments to pay off the debt faster.Other factors that affect student loan refinancing eligibilityPrivate lenders consider several different factors to determine your eligibility to qualify for student loan refinancing, including your:Credit scoreCredit historyOther debtIncomeGraduation statusBefore you apply with a lender, go through the pre-qualification process with multiple lenders to gauge your approval odds and get some rate quotes that you can compare. This process involves a soft credit check, which won\\'t impact your credit score, and can give you the information you need to determine whether refinancing is the right move for you.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ben Luthi\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 7, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is full coverage car insurance?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/full-coverage-car-insurance-205518763.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Here\\'s what you should know about full coverage car insurance and what it covers.When you\\\\u2019re shopping for auto insurance, one option you\\\\u2019ll see is full coverage. While no auto insurance policy covers everything, full coverage offers significant protection if you\\\\u2019re involved in a car accident or your vehicle is damaged by weather, vandalism or another event.Here\\\\u2019s what to know about full coverage car insurance, how it protects you financially, and whether it makes sense for you.What does it cover?Full coverage car insurance isn\\\\u2019t one type of coverage; it typically includes three coverages \\\\u2014 liability, collision, and comprehensive insurance.Liability insurance comprises two coverage types: property damage and bodily injury liability insurance. Property damage kicks in if your car damages someone else\\\\u2019s property, such as their fence, mailbox or landscaping. The bodily injury component covers you if you hurt another driver or one of their passengers in an at-fault car accident.Collision insurance reimburses you for repairs to your own vehicle or replacement after an accident.Comprehensive insurance also covers the cost of car repairs or replacement, but there\\\\u2019s an important difference. Instead of kicking in after an accident, comprehensive coverage pays when your car is damaged due to an event like severe weather, burglary, vandalism or a fire.While liability, collision, and comprehensive are common with full coverage insurance, you can add other coverage options to a full coverage policy. Some may even be mandatory, depending on your state requirements. Additional coverages include uninsured\\\\/underinsured motorist coverage, gap insurance, and rental car reimbursement coverage.Here\\\\u2019s what each covers:Underinsured\\\\/uninsured motorist coverage: Protects you if the other party at fault in a car accident doesn\\\\u2019t have enough insurance to cover your medical bills, car repairs and other expenses.Gap coverage: Protects you if your car is stolen or totaled and your remaining auto loan balance exceeds your car\\\\u2019s depreciated value.Rental car reimbursement: If your car is damaged in a covered incident, this optional coverage helps out when you need to rent a car while yours is being repaired.Does full coverage cover at-fault accidents?Full coverage car insurance will offer some protection if you\\\\u2019re found at fault in an accident. Your liability insurance protects other drivers and their passengers in this case. And your collision coverage will cover the repair or replacement of your vehicle no matter who\\\\u2019s responsible for an accident.But there are some limitations and costs to be aware of. Your insurance company will only provide coverage up to the amounts specified in your policy, known as coverage limits. For instance, if you have $25,000 in bodily injury liability insurance, but another party is seriously injured and their medical expenses exceed that amount, you\\\\u2019d likely have to pay the difference out of pocket.Insurance deductibles also apply with collision and comprehensive insurance. Your deductible is the amount you pay before your insurance kicks in. Deductible amounts vary by policy, but it\\\\u2019s common to see $500 deductibles. So if your car\\\\u2019s damage totals $4,000, you\\\\u2019d need to pay $500 and your collision insurance would pay the rest.Is personal injury protection or medical payments coverage included?The answer: It depends where you live.Personal injury protection, or PIP, is wide-ranging insurance that pays for your medical bills and other healthcare expenses, as well as lost wages, funeral costs, in-home health care, house cleaning or transportation needs related to a car accident, regardless of whether the accident was your fault.Medical payments coverage, or MedPay, is similar: It covers your own injuries, or those of your passengers, no matter who is at fault in an accident. It also pays for medical expenses if you were injured as a pedestrian or in someone else\\\\u2019s car. But it doesn\\\\u2019t cover things like lost wages or childcare expenses.PIP is required in 15 states, so in those places it\\\\u2019s included in full coverage. MedPay is required in only three states for drivers who opt out of standard coverage. It\\\\u2019s more typically an add-on.Do I need full coverage auto insurance on my car?Different states have different insurance requirements; nearly all require that you carry a minimum amount of bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. But none mandate full coverage.That said, your lender may require collision and comprehensive if you\\\\u2019re financing your vehicle. Because your car serves as collateral for your auto loan, lenders want to ensure that collateral is protected in an accident.You\\'ll pay more for full coverage than a liability-only car insurance policy, but it also offers more peace of mind \\\\u2014 and financial protection. For instance, if a large tree limb crushes your vehicle, the comprehensive insurance included with your full coverage policy would cover its replacement cost. If you had a liability-only policy, you\\\\u2019d have to pay for a new car out of pocket.Is a full policy the right coverage for you? That depends on the age, make and model of your vehicle, as well as your risk tolerance. If you drive an older, low-value car, dropping to liability-only coverage could make sense if your full coverage deductible and monthly premiums exceed your car\\\\u2019s value. Likewise, if you don\\\\u2019t drive your older car often, the risk of damage to your car decreases, so having collision and comprehensive may not make sense.Evaluate your preferred level of risk, your budget, and your insurance costs when determining if a liability-only or full coverage policy makes sense for your situation. And be sure to shop around for car insurance quotes to ensure you get the best rate.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Jess Ullrich\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 7, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What you need to know about car insurance deductibles\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/car-insurance-deductible-192739818.html\",\"Article Content\":\"A deductible makes car insurance premiums cheaper. In return for a lower premium, you agree to pay the first part of any costs to repair your vehicle for damage that you cause.Deductibles typically apply to collision and comprehensive insurance \\\\u2014 the physical damage coverages that pay to repair your own car \\\\u2014 but not to liability insurance, which pays for damages or injuries you cause to someone else.Deductibles vary, but the amount you choose may have a meaningful impact on your finances. A high deductible can reduce the amount you pay each month or each year in premiums. A low deductible means filing a claim results in little out-of-pocket expense.Here\\\\u2019s what you need to know about auto insurance deductibles, how they work, and the impact they can have on your insurance premiums and coverage.What is an insurance deductible?Your deductible is the amount of money you\\\\u2019re responsible for paying out of your own pocket for car repairs or other covered losses when your insurance company approves a claim.Car insurance policies may set different deductibles for different types of car insurance. For example, your insurance policy might include a separate collision deductible (i.e., coverage for accidents), a comprehensive deductible (i.e., coverage for losses not related to collisions), and in some cases a personal injury deductible.You have to meet your deductible before your insurance policy will begin to pay on a claim. For example, let\\\\u2019s say your car is damaged by a falling tree limb and needs $1,500 worth of repairs. If you have a $500 deductible, you\\\\u2019ll pay that amount first and then your collision coverage will cover the remaining $1,000.Deductibles affect the cost of your insurance premiums. Insurance policies with higher deductibles typically have lower premiums. But if you set your deductible too low and get into a wreck, you risk having to pay for more of the repair costs yourself.How does a car insurance deductible work?When you set up auto insurance coverage, it\\\\u2019s up to you to choose the amount for your car insurance deductible. According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), the typical deductible amount on an auto insurance policy is either $500 or $1,000. However, they can range from $0 to $2,500.Here\\\\u2019s an example of how a car insurance deductible works: Let\\\\u2019s say your car is damaged by a falling tree limb and needs $1,500 worth of repairs. If you have a $500 deductible, you\\\\u2019ll pay that amount first and then your collision coverage will cover the remaining $1,000.Your deductible generally applies each time you file a claim against your auto insurance policy \\\\u2014 just like a copay on a health insurance policy. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if your policy includes comprehensive coverage, your insurer might waive the deductible if you need chips or cracks in your windshield repaired.Factors to consider when choosing a deductibleThere\\\\u2019s a direct correlation between your car insurance deductible and the cost of your car insurance premium. And it can be difficult to find the perfect balance between the two.A higher deductible could save you money on a monthly basis (or bi-annual or annual basis if you pay in advance). By contrast, a lower deductible can help you recover faster in the event of an accident.Your goal should be to figure out the best car insurance deductible for your situation. The following questions may help.Do you have emergency savings to cover repairs and other costs? With a higher deductible, you\\\\u2019ll have to cover a bigger portion of any repair bills that arise. If that\\\\u2019s a concern, a lower deductible is probably better.Is your household budget tight? If so, a higher deductible could help you save on your insurance premium. (Just make sure you can afford the deductible if necessary.)Have you been in car accidents or do you file other types of auto insurance claims often? If the answer is no, a higher deductible might not expose you to as many out-of-pocket costs as it could be for other drivers.Are you comfortable with the financial risk that a higher deductible represents? If risk makes you nervous, a lower deductible might be better for your peace of mind.What is the value of your vehicle? If the insured vehicle\\\\u2019s value is low, a low deductible policy might make sense. However, the opposite could also be true.Like a deductible, insurance coverage limits can also impact premium costs. An insurance limit is the maximum amount your insurance policy will pay for a covered claim. If you\\\\u2019re involved in an accident (or another covered event) that results in losses that exceed your coverage limit, you\\\\u2019re responsible for paying those costs yourself as well.You can find details about your deductibles and insurance limits on the first page of your car insurance policy. This section is called the declarations page, and you can ask your insurance provider for a copy if you can\\\\u2019t locate yours.Pros and cons of high and low deductiblesBelow are some of the advantages and disadvantages of both high and low car insurance deductibles to consider.Pros of high deductiblesHigh-deductible insurance plans tend to feature lower premiums. As a result, these policies may be more affordable.People who don\\\\u2019t file claims could see the savings add up over time with a high-deductible, low premium policy.Cons of high deductiblesYou might have to put off getting your vehicle repaired if you don\\\\u2019t have the cash available to cover your portion of the bill.A lender may not allow you to choose a high-deductible option if your vehicle is financed.Pros of low deductiblesYou pay less out of pocket for covered damages, repairs, and losses with a low-deductible insurance policy.A low deductible may help reduce stress about the unknown.The insurance company assumes more upfront risk in the event of a covered claim.Cons of low deductiblesA low car insurance deductible often translates to higher premiums, which could put added strain on your budget.You might be tempted to file claims for minor damages when your deductible is low, and frequent claims could lead to premium increases by your insurance provider.Remember, there\\\\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to car insurance deductibles. Instead, your goal should be to find the right balance for your individual needs.How deductibles affect premiumsIf you want to save money on your car insurance premium, raising your deductible might accomplish that goal. Decreasing your deductible, on the other hand, could have the opposite effect. Yet, while these general rules tend to hold true across the board, the exact costs can vary between insurance providers, your state, and from one driver to the next.Below is a hypothetical example from Progressive that demonstrates how the deductible amount you select could impact your auto insurance costs.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Keep in mind that deductibles are one way to manage insurance premiums costs but not the only option. There are other smart strategies that could help you maintain affordable car insurance premiums as well:Keep a clean driving recordLook for car insurance discountsImprove your creditShop around regularly for better ratesBundle your car insurance with your homeowners insurance or renters policyAs time passes, your insurance premiums may naturally decline with age.Managing deductibles in insurance claimsWhether your insurance policy has a deductible of $0 or $2,500, the claim filing process begins the same way. If your vehicle is involved in a covered accident, you\\\\u2019ll typically want to contact your insurance company as soon as possible to file a claim. You should provide your insurer with any key information you gathered at the scene of the accident \\\\u2014 contact information of the other driver(s) involved, pictures you may have taken, details from the police report, etc.Next, your car insurance company will most likely assign an adjuster to investigate and manage your claim. The adjuster is responsible for communicating with you, other insurance companies, repair facilities, witnesses, and any other parties. They will also review any estimates that you or the repair shops you visit provide.If your adjuster approves your repair estimate, it will issue a check to you or the repair shop. Remember, your insurance company will subtract any deductible you\\\\u2019re responsible for paying from this claim check.Personal injury protection deductiblesDepending on the state where you live, you might have to carry personal injury protection, or PIP insurance, as part of your car insurance coverage. PIP insurance can help cover the cost of medical expenses, lost wages, funeral expenses, and other covered costs for drivers and passengers, regardless of who was at fault in an auto accident.If you carry PIP insurance (as a requirement of your state or on a voluntary basis), this coverage might feature a separate deductible. Just remember, if that coverage includes a separate deductible, your insurer would subtract that amount from any claim check before issuing it to you as well.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Michelle Lambright Black\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 7, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"What is term life insurance?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/what-is-term-life-insurance-170452904.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Term life insurance is a type of life insurance contract that only pays a death benefit if the insured person dies within a specific period. If the person doesn\\\\u2019t pass away during the term, the policy expires and doesn\\\\u2019t pay a benefit.Purchasing a term life policy is a surprisingly affordable way to provide financial protection for your loved ones. Read on to learn how term life insurance works, the pros and cons, and what to consider before buying a policy.What is term life insurance and how does it work?A term life insurance policy is pretty simple to understand. When you apply for a policy, you\\\\u2019ll determine how much coverage you need, as well as the policy\\\\u2019s term, i.e., the length. Typical terms are 10, 20, and 30 years. You\\\\u2019ll pay premiums to the life insurance company during the term to keep the policy in force, usually monthly or annually.If you die during the term, your insurance company will pay out the policy\\\\u2019s death benefit to your beneficiaries. The death benefit is paid in a lump sum that\\\\u2019s tax-free for your loved ones. But if you\\\\u2019re still alive at the end of the term, the policy expires without paying a benefit.Most policies nowadays are level-term policies, meaning they pay the same death benefit no matter when the death occurs during the term of coverage. With a decreasing term policy, the death benefit gets smaller as the policyholder ages.Term life insurance is sometimes referred to as pure life insurance because its sole purpose is to provide a payout to your beneficiaries if you die during the term. There\\\\u2019s no cash value, which is a savings account-like feature of permanent life insurance policies.Term vs. whole life insuranceThere are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. Whole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance.There are two major differences between term and whole life insurance:Term life insurance only pays a death benefit if you die during the specified term, whereas whole life insurance offers a guaranteed death benefit for your entire life.Whole life insurance has a savings component called cash value that you can take loans or withdrawals from while you\\\\u2019re alive, but term life insurance has no cash value. Term life offers only life insurance coverage, while whole life insurance is a hybrid product with insurance and savings\\\\/investment features.Because of the lifetime coverage and cash value component, whole life premiums are far more expensive than term life premiums. Whole life premiums can be anywhere from five to 15 times higher than 20- or 30-year term life premiums with the same amount of coverage.Benefits of term life insuranceTerm life insurance coverage offers many benefits, the most important being financial protection for your loved ones. Some advantages include:AffordabilityTerm life insurance premiums are far more affordable than other types of life insurance policies with similar death benefits. Dollar-for-dollar, your term life premiums will buy you a much larger death benefit than you\\\\u2019d find with permanent life insurance.The amount you\\\\u2019ll pay will vary based on your age, gender, health conditions, occupation and whether you\\\\u2019re a smoker. The younger and healthier you are, the lower your premium payments will be. But even if you have pre-existing health issues, you can often obtain term coverage at an affordable rate.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.FlexibilityWith term insurance, you can buy a policy based on your specific circumstances. Many people choose a death benefit and policy term according to their financial obligations. For example, you may want to buy enough coverage to pay off your mortgage, replace your income until your children reach adulthood, or cover the costs of your kids\\\\u2019 education. Some people also buy coverage to protect their parents if they co-signed on student loans.Ability to cancel any timeYou can cancel term life insurance at any time without incurring fees if you decide you no longer need coverage.Disadvantages of term life insuranceOf course, term life insurance won\\\\u2019t be the right choice for everyone. Here are some drawbacks to consider before you purchase a policy.No cash valueUnlike permanent life insurance, term life insurance doesn\\\\u2019t build cash value. If you want a policy with a built-in savings or investment component, consider a whole life, universal life or variable life policy.Expires at the end of the termTerm life insurance won\\\\u2019t pay a death benefit if you outlive the term. Your premiums won\\\\u2019t be refunded unless you purchase an add-on called a return of premium rider, which can make your policy as much as five times more expensive.Having coverage that expires isn\\\\u2019t always problematic, though. If you live into your 80s or 90s, it\\\\u2019s less likely that you\\\\u2019ll have people who financially depend on you. However, if you want your survivors to receive a payout no matter when you die, you\\\\u2019ll need permanent coverage.Increased premiums when you renewIf you still need protection after your term expires, you\\\\u2019ll need to renew your policy or purchase a new one. Most term policies offer something called guaranteed renewability, which means you can extend the policy and its death benefit without going through the underwriting process again or having another medical exam.But your premiums will usually be higher. That\\\\u2019s because our lives become more expensive to insure as we age. For the same reason, purchasing new term insurance when your policy expires will typically be more expensive.Term life insurance rates and costsWhen you apply for term life insurance, carriers will assess how risky of an applicant you are. The higher your risk of dying during the specified term, the more you\\\\u2019ll pay. Some important factors that affect term life insurance rates include:Age: Because the risk of death grows higher as you get older, your date of birth is the most important factor insurers consider.Gender: Premiums are typically lower for women than for men because women have longer life expectancies.Health history: Insurers usually review your health records and often require a medical exam during the underwriting process. Some medical conditions will result in higher term life insurance costs or a denial of your application. Carriers will also ask about your family\\\\u2019s history of illness.Tobacco usage: Because smoking carries a higher mortality risk, smokers pay higher premiums. You can often qualify for non-smoker rates after being tobacco-free for one or two years.Hobbies and occupation: People in high-risk occupations, like first responders and construction workers, can expect to pay a higher premium. The same goes for those who engage in risky hobbies, like skydiving or rock climbing.Policy terms: Longer policy terms mean there\\\\u2019s a higher chance a life insurance company will have to pay a death benefit, so you\\\\u2019ll pay more for a 20-year or 30-year term policy than you would for a 10-year term. The higher your death benefit, the higher your premiums will be, as well.Coverage amount and term lengthYour coverage amount and term length will depend on your needs and what you can afford, as well as what you\\\\u2019re approved for during the underwriting process. Someone who is 70 is unlikely to qualify for a 30-year term and would probably have to settle for a 10- or 15-year policy.The DIME formula (debt, income, mortgage, and education) is a common method for determining how much term life insurance you need. Using this formula, you\\\\u2019d add up the following:Debt: Total non-mortgage debtIncome: Your salary times the number of years your family would need to replace that income. Many people use the number of years until their youngest child graduates from high school. So if you earn $60,000 a year and your youngest is 8 years old, they\\\\u2019d be 10 years about graduating, so you\\\\u2019d need about $600,000.Mortgage: Total amount you\\\\u2019d need to pay off your mortgage and any home equity loansEducation: The amount you anticipate paying for each child\\\\u2019s educationBecause your individual needs may be unique, consider working with a life insurance agent to determine the right terms and coverage and get multiple life insurance quotes.Additional options and ridersWhen you buy term life insurance, you\\\\u2019ll often have the option to purchase add-ons known as life insurance riders for an extra cost. Some common life insurance riders include:Accelerated death benefit rider: Allows you to access your death benefit if you\\\\u2019re diagnosed with a qualifying illness (usually, one that\\\\u2019s terminal).Accidental death benefit rider: Increases the policy\\\\u2019s death benefit if you die in an accident.Child or spousal rider: Provides a small death benefit if your child or spouse dies during your policy term, typically to cover final expenses.Term conversion rider: Gives you the option to convert a term policy into a whole life policy at the end of the term.Waiver of premium rider: Allows you to stop paying premiums while keeping the policy in force if you become disabled.Does a term policy meet your life insurance needs?If you have dependents who would struggle financially if you died, life insurance is a must. One of the biggest benefits of term life insurance is that it provides valuable protection for your loved ones at a low cost.Because coverage only lasts for the policy\\\\u2019s term, it\\\\u2019s appropriate when you have specific obligations or temporary needs. For instance, you may want a term policy with a death benefit that could pay off your mortgage and other debts to reduce the financial burden on your spouse or cover your children\\\\u2019s needs in the event you die before they\\\\u2019ve finished their obligations.Term life insurance doesn\\\\u2019t build cash value, so it isn\\\\u2019t a vehicle for saving or investing. But for most people, it provides sufficient financial protection at an affordable price.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Robin Hartill, CFP\\\\u00ae\",\"Article Date\":\"Thu, Sep 7, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"Custom parts and equipment insurance: what it covers\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/custom-parts-and-equipment-insurance-160731485.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Standard car insurance typically does not cover aftermarket parts that are added to a vehicle to boost its performance or appeal. Insurers price their coverage based on costs to repair or replace a vehicle as it came from the original manufacturer.If you want to cover such aftermarket modifications\\\\u00a0\\\\u2014 things like amped-up stereos or suspension systems, custom rims, tinted windows, cosmetic paint jobs, and more \\\\u2014 you\\\\u2019ll need to add an optional endorsement to your auto insurance policy called custom parts and equipment (CPE) coverage.This endorsement, or rider, is added to your comprehensive or collision policy and effectively covers your aftermarket \\\\u201cmods\\\\u201d under the same terms. If an incident is covered, then so, too, will the included aftermarket parts. Likewise, the same single car insurance deductible applies.Custom parts and equipment riders can be added to your car insurance policy for as little as several dollars a month on your premiums and typically provide a maximum level of coverage for the aftermarket parts, often a combined total of $5,000.What is custom parts coverage?Custom parts and equipment coverage is optional insurance that covers aftermarket modifications made to enhance your vehicle\\\\u2019s looks or performance. It is not for aftermarket parts \\\\u2014 a term used for non-manufacturer parts \\\\u2014 that your mechanic finds and installs to keep the car running.CPE coverage is added to your comprehensive and\\\\/or collision policies and comes with a maximum payout amount per event or car accident, usually between $2,000 and $10,000. The typical coverage limit is $5,000.What modifications need extra insurance?Any part that you install on the car that did not come from the factory as part of the original model is considered a modification and could require custom parts and equipment coverage. Common examples include:Custom wheels and rimsOversized and custom tiresSpeakers, TVs, DVD players and other electronic equipmentLeather seat coversRoll barsTrailer hitchesBed linersRunning boardsTintingCustom paint jobsStrut barsSpoilersNavigation systemsUndercarriage lighting, fog lights and other custom lightsDoes regular insurance cover aftermarket parts?In a few states, aftermarket parts are automatically covered up to $1,000 in comprehensive and collision policies. In addition, some insurers may include certain types of modifications in your comprehensive or collision coverage, particularly if those modifications are considered safety components. An example might be an anti-theft device or rear-view camera. In fact, some of these can potentially lead to auto insurance discounts.In general, though, you\\\\u2019ll want to assume that the insurer is not going to cover any modifications or enhancements you make to your car. Review the policy\\\\u2019s fine print or call your insurance company to ask. It\\\\u2019s important to note that \\\\u201cfull coverage\\\\u201d does not mean aftermarket parts are included. Having \\\\u201cfull coverage\\\\u201d simply means having all three categories of insurance: comprehensive, collision, and liability. And when the insurer is pricing those standard auto insurance policies, it is assuming you drive a model that includes only factory parts.Does insurance cover rim damage?Original rims that came with the car, or that were installed to the manufacturer\\\\u2019s specifications, are covered just like other parts of the car under your comprehensive and collision insurance. If the rims are damaged in a covered event \\\\u2014 say you hit rocks or a pothole \\\\u2014 standard rims will be covered, though repairs in many cases may not exceed your deductible amount.However, if you have added aftermarket rims, then you will need to add a custom parts and equipment endorsement to your policy to cover them.The tire and wheel insurance marketed by car dealers often covers 100% of the cost of repairs or replacement of damaged rims and tires on the car at the time of sale. Many insurers offer similar plans at a much-reduced cost.Informing your insurance company about modificationsIn most cases, aftermarket parts do not void\\\\u00a0your regular insurance coverage. But if you use aftermarket parts that the insurer thinks could compromise safety, the company could conceivably void your policy and refuse to make any payouts at all. Examples include changes to the suspension system that affect the way the car handles; spoilers or scoops that make the car faster; or engine modifications that boost its speed.That\\\\u2019s why it\\\\u2019s a good idea to inform your auto insurer of any changes you make to the vehicle. In addition, if you want the insurer to cover an added part, it\\\\u2019s a good bet the insurer will need to know about the part before you file a claim.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Karen Aho\",\"Article Date\":\"Fri, Sep 8, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How many checking accounts should I have?\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/how-many-checking-accounts-should-i-have-191519405.html\",\"Article Content\":\"Where you keep your money is just as important as what you spend it on. The right mix of financial accounts can help you stay organized and hit your financial goals a lot faster.One of the most basic types of accounts is a traditional checking account. For some, one checking account is enough to get the job done, while others might benefit from having more than one checking account. Here\\\\u2019s what you need to know to decide if one or multiple checking accounts is right for your financial situation.Checking accounts, explainedA checking account is a type of deposit account offered by banks and credit unions in which you can add money or make payments to cover bills and living expenses using a debit card, online bill pay, or personal check. Unlike a savings account or money market account, checking accounts are meant to be more transactional, with frequent deposits and withdrawals.Checking accounts are one of the most common banking products held by a majority of American consumers. According to the 2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, 95.5% of US households \\\\u2014 about 126.6 million Americans \\\\u2014 were \\\\\"banked\\\\\" in 2021, meaning that at least one member of the household had a checking or high-yield savings account at a bank or credit union.When it makes sense to have multiple checking accountsInstances where having more than one checking account could come in handy might include:If you\\\\u2019re merging your financesHaving more than one checking account could make it easier to divide your monthly bills and keep your personal spending separate from shared expenses with your partner, roommate, or family members.Say you share the cost of groceries or household products; having a joint checking account could make it easier to keep track of how much you\\\\u2019re spending on household bills and ensure that those expenses aren\\\\u2019t eating away at your personal budget.If your checking account balance exceeds FDIC or NCUA coverageMost deposit accounts are federally insured if your bank or credit union is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Association (NCUA). Typically, the limit is $250,000 per depositor, per account. The upside here is that if your financial institution fails, your money is protected. However, if you keep more than the maximum amount of money covered in your bank account, you could run the risk of losing some of those funds should your banking institution fail.In these cases, it could make sense to open a separate account and keep some of your funds in that account so that you\\\\u2019re always covered. If you are putting away a large sum of money, the best place for it would likely be an interest-bearing account. While there are checking accounts that earn interest, these interest rates are typically lower than APYs on high-yield savings accounts, CDs, or money market accounts.If your bank is offering a lucrative promotion or sign-up bonusTo attract new customers, banks or credit unions may incentivize you to open a new account by rewarding you with a sign-up bonus. The terms usually require that you set up direct deposit and fund your account within a certain period of time in order to take advantage of this kind of promotion.You shouldn\\\\u2019t open a new checking account simply to take advantage of a sign-up bonus, but if your goal is to organize your finances and create separate accounts for different spending needs, a sign-up bonus might be the right reason to do so.If you primarily bank online and need ATM or branch accessOnline banks, or neobanks, have risen in popularity as a low-cost way to bank. Because these institutions don\\\\u2019t have brick-and-mortar branches, these banks can save on overhead costs and pass those savings down to customers in the form of lower fees and higher APYs.The downside: If you bank with an online-only bank, you may not have the same access to ATMs or a bank representative that you do with a traditional bank.In these cases, opening up a checking account at a different bank with a physical location near you could make it easier to transfer funds and withdraw cash without incurring steep bank fees.If you\\\\u2019re starting a businessMany financial institutions offer financial products that cater to business owners like business checking accounts, credit cards, small business loans, and more. Keeping your personal transactions separate from your business transactions can help you keep better track of your income and outflow.It can also help you understand how your business is doing from a profitability standpoint and simplify your recordkeeping in the event of a tax audit.How to determine the right number of checking accounts for youThere is no \\\\u201cright\\\\u201d number of checking accounts, but there are factors you can consider to determine the right number of accounts for your financial situation.What are your financial goals?Outlining your short and long-term goals can help you narrow down which kinds of financial products make the most sense for you. The answer may not be multiple checking accounts. It could involve a mix of account types, perhaps a checking account for your everyday spending and a certificate of deposit for a longer-term savings goal like putting money away for a down payment for your first home.If your aim is to grow your emergency fund, opting for a savings vehicle that is less accessible could make more sense so that you aren\\\\u2019t tempted to dip into your account for short-term expenses.What does your everyday spending look like?If you are moving in with your partner and have shared expenses as well as personal expenses \\\\u2014 such as a monthly student loan payment \\\\u2014 having more than one checking account will ensure that those funds don\\\\u2019t get mixed up.If you\\\\u2019re still hesitant about the idea of opening another checking account, there are tools you can use to accomplish the same goal that multiple checking accounts would. Mint, Rocket Money, Honeydue, and EveryDollar are budgeting apps you can use to split bills with a partner, keep track of your monthly bills, or both.Would multiple checking accounts simplify your personal finances?Having more than one checking account can make it easier to categorize your income into buckets and allocate a certain amount; however, it can also make it more difficult to track how your income is being spent.Certain checking accounts may also have minimum balance requirements that you\\\\u2019ll need to adhere to to avoid any added fees or penalties. If you prefer to keep things simple, you can opt for just one checking account for your regular spending and one savings account where you can save money for bigger expenses and goals.\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Ivana Pino\",\"Article Date\":\"Wed, Sep 6, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n{\"Article Title\":\"How to open a CD\",\"Article Link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/finance.yahoo.com\\\\/personal-finance\\\\/how-to-open-a-cd-165257375.html\",\"Article Content\":\"concept of financial wealth, investment success. happy people character make money. Cartoon millionaire or banker holding big coin. Financial growth, flat vector illustration on a white background.If you have a sum of money that you want to save securely, a certificate of deposit, usually called a CD, is a good option. However, unlike a traditional savings account, once you open and fund a CD, your money has to remain tucked away for a fixed period of time.Read on to understand if a CD is the right kind of savings vehicle for you, and how to open one if it is.How a CD worksA CD stores and grows your money for a fixed period, known as its term, usually ranging anywhere from a month to five years, though longer-term CDs are available. A CD can be ideal if you want to save for a long-term goal, such as purchasing a home.What sets a CD apart from other deposit accounts, like a high-yield savings account, is that CDs have a fixed rate. This means that your APY isn\\\\u2019t sensitive to interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve after you\\\\u2019ve already opened your account.However, if you think you may need access to your money for unexpected costs, a CD probably isn\\\\u2019t the best choice. If you withdraw money from a CD before its term ends, also known as its maturity date, you\\\\u2019ll likely pay an early withdrawal penalty, reducing \\\\u2014 or even eliminating \\\\u2014 any interest you may have earned. In some cases, you could even lose some of your initial deposit.Also, if you\\\\u2019re the kind of saver who wants to make additional deposits and continue to build on your balance, you might consider a different type of savings product like a traditional savings or money market account. Most CDs don\\\\u2019t allow you to continue making deposits after your first deposit.Once your CD has reached the end of the term, you can withdraw your principal balance, plus any earned interest. In some cases, you might opt to rollover your CD into a new account and continue to grow your savings that way.Go deeper: How to choose the right CD.Decide what kind of CD to openThere are several different types of CDs, and it\\\\u2019s important to choose the one most suited to your savings goal.Here are the most common types:Traditional CD: The most common type of CD; your initial deposit must remain untouched for a fixed term. If you withdraw your money early, you\\\\u2019ll pay a penalty.Jumbo CD: A traditional CD but with a higher minimum opening deposit, usually at least $100,000. It will pay a higher annual percentage yield, or APY.No-penalty CD: A CD without an early withdrawal penalty but with a lower APY.Add-on CD: You can add more money to this CD even after opening the account.Bump-up CD: You can choose to increase the APY a limited number of times during the CD term to keep up with rising interest rates.Not every financial institution will offer all CD types. When you\\\\u2019re shopping for a CD, read the fine print on the deposit agreement to ensure you know what you\\\\u2019re signing up for.Go deeper: How to save with CDs.Choose a term length and shop for the best CD rateCDs with longer terms usually offer higher annual percentage yields \\\\u2014 up to a point. CD APYs tend to reflect market expectations for interest rates. So if rates are expected to rise in the short term but fall in a couple of years, CDs with terms up to two years may offer higher rates than those with a three-year term.Be sure to compare APYs and terms carefully so you get the best rate for the term that suits your financial goals. For example, if you want to buy a house in a year and are keeping your down payment in a CD, choose one with a 12-month term or less.A CD\\\\u2019s APY is a calculation of the total return you\\\\u2019ll earn, including compound interest. Compound interest is the interest you earn on previously accrued interest. Like savings accounts, CD APYs will differ depending from bank to bank. Online banks often offer better APYs than traditional banks. And don\\\\u2019t overlook credit unions, which call CDs share certificates, and sometimes offer higher APYs.Go deeper: What is APY?Where to open a CD accountOnce you choose a bank, credit union or neobank, you can complete an application online or in person. If you\\\\u2019re opening a new CD online, you\\'ll have to create an account with the bank or credit union if you don\\'t have one already.To open a CD, you\\'ll usually have to provide the following information:Full legal nameSocial Security number or taxpayer identification numberBirth dateCurrent addressYou must be 18 or older to open a CD. If you are younger than 18, a parent or legal guardian can open a custodial CD for you.Fund your CDOnce you select the CD and term, you\\\\u2019ll transfer funds to the financial institution or write a check to fund the account.FAQsHow much can I deposit in a CD?Many online banks and credit unions do not have minimum deposit requirements, but some major banks have a minimum opening deposit requirement starting at $1,000. If you don\\\\u2019t have that much money, look for a bank with a low or no minimum deposit. The maximum you can deposit also varies depending on the bank or credit union.If your financial institution is a member of the FDIC or the NCUA, your CDs are insured for up to $250,000. If you have more than that to put aside, you may want to speak to a professional financial adviser about how to proceed.Does it cost money to open a CD?Opening a CD does not come with a separate fee.Can I undo opening a CD?Before you fund your CD, check your bank or credit union\\\\u2019s policies to see if it offers a grace period at the time of opening. These are not common, so it\\\\u2019s best to be sure before you open your account.How many CDs can I open?There is no limit to how many CDs you can open in general, but some banks may have a maximum number of CDs you can open with them. If you plan to use a CD ladder as part of your savings strategy, you should ask your financial institution what that limit is.Click the image to compare CDs\",\"Article Anthor\":\"Zina Kumok\",\"Article Date\":\"Wed, Sep 6, 2023\",\"Article Source\":\"YahooFinance\"}\\n', metadata={'source': '/content/qqz_YahooFinance.json'}),\n",

Purchasing investment properties requires different factors, decisions, and calculations that regular real estate agents don\\\\u2019t use. A real estate license isn\\\\u2019t enough to qualify agents to help you with real estate investment purchases. So before you hire an agent to work with you in your real estate investment business, you should know what to ask the agent before starting out. 1. Are You a Full-Time Agent? Real estate investors need full-time agents with a 100% focus on real estate. While many agents work part-time and do well at it, real estate investors need top-performing agents who are 100% dedicated to real estate. They should constantly have their ears on the ground to find the best properties for your real estate portfolio. The home buying process is intense, and if you work with an agent who doesn\\\\u2019t work full-time, you may not get the attention to detail you need. An agent who is distracted by other jobs or responsibilities may miss the crucial moment a property becomes available, thereby handing it over to the competition because they weren\\\\u2019t on the job at the time. 2. How Much Experience Do You Have? Many buyers don\\\\u2019t ask about an agent\\\\u2019s experience level because they feel like they are prying, but working with experienced agents is the key to reaching your real estate goals. Suppose you have the choice between a prospective agent who has only sold one investment property versus another prospective Realtor with years of experience buying and selling investment properties. In that case, you\\\\u2019ll likely go with the agent with more recently sold homes. Don\\\\u2019t be afraid to ask intimate questions about an agent\\\\u2019s experience.       3. How Many Clients Are You Working With? Knowing how many buyers and sellers a real estate agent accepts at once is important. Compare the number of clients the agent takes on at a time to the level of service you expect. A great agent can handle many clients simultaneously, but you must compare it to what you expect when house hunting or selling properties. If an agent has too many clients, it can affect the level of service you receive. 4. Are Your Clients Mostly Buyers or Sellers? Real estate investors buy and sell properties. Depending on what you need to do, you\\\\u2019ll need different types of agents.\\\\u00a0 A buyer\\\\u2019s agent represents you when buying a home. They are the agents with their ears to the ground, waiting for the perfect property to hit the market.\\\\u00a0 These agents negotiate the deal for you and help you seal the deal. They are your eyes and ears out in the market. A seller\\\\u2019s agent works for the seller, marketing the property based on the listing agreement. A home sells when a real estate agent sets the right selling price and markets the property appropriately. Since you\\\\u2019re investing in real estate to make a profit, you want an agent who will get as much money as possible for the home and market it so that it sells fast. 5. Do You Invest Yourself? Working with real estate agents who invest in real estate themselves brings a whole new level to the support they can provide. Like anything in life, you learn more by doing, so working with someone who understands the ins and outs of owning investment real estate is a game changer. They\\\\u2019ll understand the buying and selling process and can help make investing in real estate easier for you. Of course, you don\\\\u2019t want to hire an agent with the same real estate investing strategy as you, as that would create a conflict of interest. Working with a real estate professional who understands the factors most important to you when investing in real estate is an important consideration. 6. What Sets You Apart From Other Agents? We all know the real estate market is competitive, and there are many real estate agents out there, so asking an agent what sets them apart from the rest can help you decide which one is the best fit for you and your needs. If an agent can\\\\u2019t come up with something that sets them apart from the others, what benefits do you have by choosing that agent? Look for agents who take pride in their work and specialize in the areas you need, such as fix-and-flips or finding rental properties, so you get matched with the right person for you. 7. Do You Have a Team? If So, What Role Do You Play in the Process? Working with a real estate team may be a good idea, but if you choose an agent who doles out all the responsibilities to the team and never has any hands-on experience with you, it might not be what you want. Ask an agent specifically which tasks they delegate and which they handle themselves. For example, will the agent call you about new properties themselves, or will they give that task to an administrative assistant? Also, ask who will answer your questions and concerns when they arise. This doesn\\\\u2019t mean team members aren\\\\u2019t up to the task, but when you hire an agent, that\\\\u2019s who you want to work with on the most important details of the process. 8. How Well Do You Know the Local Market? If you\\\\u2019re investing in an area you aren\\\\u2019t familiar with, you need an agent who is familiar with the area. This is especially important if you\\\\u2019re buying a rental property. You must know about the quality of the schools, the proximity to highways and public transportation, and the accessibility of amenities like grocery stores, churches, and other basic needs. 9. What Is Your Purchase Price to List Price Ratio? The purchase price to list price ratio compares the final sales price to the last listing price and tells you how often the agent can help their sellers get the highest selling price for their home. This may not reflect the original listing price if the price changes, but it will give you a good idea. Numbers below 100% mean the agent often sells the house for less than the asking price, and any number above 100% means the agent sells the house for more than the asking price. If you\\\\u2019re selling homes, you want an agent with a high sale-to-list-price ratio, and vice versa if you\\\\u2019re buying homes. 10. What Fees Must I Pay? If you\\\\u2019re buying investment properties, you shouldn\\\\u2019t be on the hook for any fees regarding the real estate professional. However, if you\\\\u2019re selling properties, you\\\\u2019re responsible for the agent\\\\u2019s commission, plus any other fees. Both buyers and sellers are responsible for fees such as: \\\\nAppraisals\\\\nAttorney fees\\\\nClosing costs\\\\nCredit reports\\\\nTitle insurance\\\\n Ask the agent what fees are included in the real estate transaction and which you\\\\u2019d be responsible for if you chose them as your agent. Also ask the agent if their commission fees are negotiable, especially if they are higher than other agents\\\\u2019 fees. 11. How Many Clients Have You Helped Purchase Investment Properties? A real estate agent can say they specialize in real estate investment properties, but that doesn\\\\u2019t mean they have experience in it. Ask real estate professionals how many investment properties they\\\\u2019ve successfully closed within the last 12 months. Having experience as a buyer\\\\u2019s agent for one investment property doesn\\\\u2019t make the agent an expert in the real estate industry. You can also take it a step further and ask a Realtor how they get in touch with a listing agent. Does the agent already have a large network of agents they work with, or do they cold-call agents and work their magic to win their clients the property? 12. Can You Provide References From Past Clients? Nothing tells you more about an agent\\\\u2019s abilities than the words of past clients. Consider it a red flag if you ask a real estate agent for referrals and they don\\\\u2019t offer them. A good agent should happily hand over referrals to get more business\\\\u2014unless they didn\\\\u2019t do a good job and are worried about what previous clients will say to you. Of course, you can also read online reviews from satisfied clients (or unsatisfied clients), but hearing from people who have worked with this particular person can give you a better feel for what an agent offers. 13. Do You Find Properties Other Than Those Listed in the Multiple Listing Service? A big part of success in real estate investing is finding properties at the right time. Waiting until properties hit the MLS can be too late, especially if you invest in fix-and-flip properties or look for short sales. Finding an agent with resources outside the MLS can make all the difference in your transactions because it is such a competitive market. If you find an agent who finds properties outside the MLS, ask what strategies they use and what types of homes they find. For example, do they locate abandoned properties for fix-and-flips or target people about to enter foreclosure, helping their buyers purchase short-sale properties? 14. What Is Your Marketing Plan? Working with a full-time agent isn\\\\u2019t enough; you need to find an agent with a solid marketing strategy. Ask agents about how they market homes they sell and how they find homes for and target buyers. Ensure the strategy fits your investment needs and will help you find the right properties. For example, it wouldn\\\\u2019t be a good fit if you\\\\u2019re selling a small starter townhouse and the agent specializes in luxury homes. 15. Can You Help Me Find Other Professionals? Real estate investors need to work with other professionals, such as: \\\\nAppraisers\\\\nGeneral contractors\\\\nLawyers\\\\nLenders\\\\nMoving companies\\\\n Ask about an agent\\\\u2019s network to ensure they have the professionals on board to help you succeed in real estate transactions. 16. How Often Will I Hear From You? Time is of the essence in real estate. When looking for real estate agents, have a definition of what a timely manner is in your mind, and see how it compares to what potential real estate agents offer. For example, if an agent provides updates every few days but you prefer daily updates, you should change real estate agents to one who communicates more regularly. 17. Why Are You a Good Fit for Me? Of course, the most important question you can ask any real estate agent is why they are a good fit for you. Let them sell you the reasons they should be the person you pick for the important job of finding real estate properties. If an agent can\\\\u2019t answer the question, that means they didn\\\\u2019t get to know you well enough or don\\\\u2019t take enough pride in their work. You want someone who will proudly say why they stand apart from most agents and how they can help you with your home sale or purchase to achieve your real estate goals. How to Find an Investor-Friendly Agent Now that you know what to ask a real estate agent, the next question is, how do you find qualified agents? A few ways are to join real estate investing groups, talk to property management companies, and network online. The more people you talk to, the easier it is to find the perfect professional for you. Another great way to find an agent is through referrals. Working with someone who you know does a great job based on someone else\\\\u2019s input can provide peace of mind, knowing you\\\\u2019re working with a good professional.

Nearly sixty percent of homes for sale are unaffordable to the average American. What\\\\u2019s causing such a lack of affordability? High mortgage rates, meager supply, and baby boomers refusing to sell their single-family homes (seriously). These factors have created a housing market where \\\\u201cforced renter households\\\\u201d will become the norm\\\\u2026but not for long. According to Matthew Gardner, Chief Economist at Windermere Real Estate, there\\\\u2019s at least some hope on the horizon. Mathew knows the solution to this almost unfathomable unaffordability issue, and it\\\\u2019s much simpler than most people think. In this episode, he talks about the primary driver of high home prices, the factors causing so many Americans to rent, and why we can\\\\u2019t repair this market using the same housing market \\\\u201cincentives\\\\u201d that worked in the past. And, as someone who works regularly with large-scale investors, Mathew has some advice for those still trying to invest in a market where profits seem improbable. When will mortgage rates head down?

James, is that a\\\\u2026 Do you have a tower of Rockstar Energy Drink behind you? James:\\\\nI do, it\\\\u2019s my\\\\u2026 My staff got me a Rockstar cake for my 40th birthday. So, it had this beautiful bouquet on top, and so it\\\\u2019s been slow. It\\\\u2019s kind of like the cake in your kitchen though. I could feel like I\\\\u2019m pulling the frosting off because I\\\\u2019m pulling one can out at a time. I was trying to keep it, but I can\\\\u2019t help it. Dave:\\\\nJames, you\\\\u2019re an easy man to buy a gift for, if all you need is Rockstar Energy Drink. For those who don\\\\u2019t know James personally, he is never more than a few inches away from Rockstar, so that seems like a very good gift for him. James:\\\\nA sales fuel. Sales fuel. Dave:\\\\nAbsolutely. Well, you recommended the excellent guest we have today. Tell us first of all, who our guest is and why you wanted to bring him on? James:\\\\nYeah, so Matthew Gardner is the chief economist of the Windermere, which is a real estate company mostly in the Pacific Northwest or the West Coast. But in our local market, they are the biggest brokerage. They have the best brand presence. And for years, I\\\\u2019ve been listening to Matthew talk about the economy, whether it was in the recession times or even up in today, and he\\\\u2019s just very factual. He understands stats, he looks at trends, and he\\\\u2019s just a very smart guy. And he\\\\u2019s so well-spoken with how he delivers the information. But everybody in the Pacific Northwest loves Matthew. We all listen to his reports. He always provides value. Dave:\\\\nYeah, absolutely. I didn\\\\u2019t know who Matthew was until we booked him for the show, and I\\\\u2019ve been reading some of his reports here. And I\\\\u2019m super excited to talk to him about affordability, because this is\\\\u2026 We talk about rates, which obviously is a lot on the show, that has a huge impact on affordability. But there are a lot of variables that go into affordability. And I think there\\\\u2019s a little bit of misunderstanding and confusion around the topic, so I\\\\u2019m really looking forward to digging into the affordability question with him. Is there anything else you\\\\u2019re hoping to talk to him about? James:\\\\nWell, I am hoping he gives me a little gold nugget for the Pacific Northwest of what to go buy, but I don\\\\u2019t know if he\\\\u2019s going to be able to give me that. Dave:\\\\nLike, you want a specific address, like he\\\\u2019s going to tell you exactly what to go buy. James:\\\\nYeah, \\\\u201cBuy here, it will grow.\\\\u201d Dave:\\\\nIf he knows that, he might keep that for some paying clients. I don\\\\u2019t know if he just dishes that out to an entire podcast audience. James:\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s true. Well, maybe we\\\\u2019ll be buddy buddies by the end of the podcast, and he\\\\u2019ll give me those little golden gems. Dave:\\\\nWell, I think no matter what, it might not be down to the address level, but I\\\\u2019m sure we\\\\u2019re going to get some golden gems out of Matthew. And for all of you listening, if you do appreciate us bringing on these types of economists who help you unpack and understand the market that we\\\\u2019re in right now, I help identify opportunities for your own investment portfolio. Please make sure to write On The Market a review. You can do that either on Spotify or on Apple.\\\\nAnd I know it\\\\u2019s just like this little thing, and I promise it only takes like 30 seconds, but it really does help the show a lot be able to attract these types of guests, and continuing to make this great content. So, if you\\\\u2019re a loyal listener and you haven\\\\u2019t yet written us a review, we would really appreciate if you took one minute to do that on Spotify or Apple right now. With that said, let\\\\u2019s bring on Matthew Gardner, the chief economist for Windermere Real Estate. Matthew Gardner, welcome to On The Market. Thanks for being here. Matthew:\\\\nHello, Dave. Good to be here. Thanks for the invitation. Dave:\\\\nAbsolutely. We\\\\u2019re excited to have you. Let\\\\u2019s start by having you introduce yourself and tell our audience a little bit about what you do as it relates to real estate and real estate investing. Matthew:\\\\nAs far as a background, as you can probably gather, I\\\\u2019m not from around here. I was born, raised and educated in the United Kingdom. After completing my formal education at Oxford and London School of Economics, I joined an old company of land agents. And these are companies that managed institutional portfolios of real estate. And the company I worked for represented not just my college, but the royal family as well. And there, I was involved as an analyst in advising on their portfolio, where they should sell, where they should buy.\\\\nI came to the Pacific Northwest, I\\\\u2019m based now in Seattle, in the late \\\\u201990s to visit my sister actually who was already living here. And what I found very quickly is that real estate developers, well, they really ride on themselves in deciding what to build. No one\\\\u2019s really advising them. So, I saw a niche, opened up my own company, spent 18 years advising developers, governments, and other entities on what was going on in the development world. And Windermere Real Estate was a very early client of mine. That relationship continued through my entire time having my company. So, eight years ago when they talked me into joining them\\\\u2026 And Windermere is a company, if you don\\\\u2019t know this, we have about 300 offices in the 10 Western States. About 6,500 brokers that sold roughly $45 billion worth of real estate last year. And as chief economist, my ultimate goal is to analyze and interpret economic information, so I can advise our brokers on what\\\\u2019s going on, so they can therefore best advise their clients. Dave:\\\\nAll right, Matthew. Well, I could see why James wanted to have you on. You\\\\u2019re obviously an expert in his favorite market of Seattle, and obviously are doing the type of work that all of our audience is very eager to hear about. So, I\\\\u2019ve read a few of your reports, but let\\\\u2019s start\\\\u2026 I want to dig into affordability today, but let\\\\u2019s just start by having you share some of your just high-level thoughts about the housing market today, to get us rolling. Matthew:\\\\nWell, I think the big thing that everyone, it\\\\u2019s like the 800-pound gorilla for want of a better word, is inventory. There is none. And of course there\\\\u2019s nothing on the market to buy, then brokers can\\\\u2019t sell anything. And that\\\\u2019s the reason why we\\\\u2019re going to see a remarkably low level of transactions this year. Now, is it going to get better? Well, that\\\\u2019s perhaps something we\\\\u2019ll talk about momentarily. But I think there are a couple of things are, one is supply, lack of it.\\\\nAnd on the other side of the equation, is a lot of people saying, \\\\u201cOkay, well, look at where interest rates, where mortgage rates are today. We\\\\u2019re at what? 7.2% I think, this morning. Isn\\\\u2019t that going to cause the market to, in essence, collapse in the same way it did in 2007?\\\\u201d And I would argue that is certainly not the case, but it is a big concern. It\\\\u2019s a big concern certainly as it relates to affordability. But right now, we are in a housing market that quite frankly just lacks direction. It doesn\\\\u2019t know where it wants to be and where it\\\\u2019s going to go, certainly over the course of the next year or so. James:\\\\nWhat we\\\\u2019ve seen over the last six months is you keep hearing the doom and gloom about rate increasing. We\\\\u2019ve seen them dramatically go up over the last nine months. And I think everybody\\\\u2019s been waiting for that shoe to drop, but yet that we still see the median home price creeping up nationwide, which is, I don\\\\u2019t know if that\\\\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing for Jerome Powell, and whether he\\\\u2019s just going to keep increasing rates because it\\\\u2019s not going in the direction he wants.\\\\nBut what is your take on that, because I think that\\\\u2019s caught everybody off guard. I did not think that the median home price would be climbing. And it\\\\u2019s not going up rapidly, but it\\\\u2019s had steady increases as rates keep going up. Is that a concern that you think rates will continue to go? Or is it more that you just think that the inventory\\\\u2019s so low, it doesn\\\\u2019t even matter, and people are finding a way to buy? Matthew:\\\\nI think it\\\\u2019s probably more the latter rather than the former in that respect, James. Do I think rates are going to continue to rise? I think it is unlikely. And I think quite frankly that we\\\\u2019ve peaked out pretty much where we are today. I\\\\u2019ll be massively surprised, I think everyone else would, to see rates continue to get up into the eights, and even potentially north of that. So, I think we\\\\u2019ve peaked.\\\\nBut as far as its impact on housing, I think you\\\\u2019re absolutely right. A lot of people thought it will, borrowing costs, if they\\\\u2019ve doubled. And as we all know, right? It\\\\u2019s a very simple piece of math. If you want to keep the same payment, well, for every one percentage point increase in mortgage rates, you can afford to borrow 10% less, and keep that payment the same.\\\\nSo, whatever you\\\\u2019re paying, let\\\\u2019s say at four, if rates went to five, and you wanted to keep that payment the same as you had before, then you could borrow 10% less. So, everyone thought, \\\\u201cYeah, the market\\\\u2019s going to cause the market to collapse, some massive erosion in home prices.\\\\u201d But it is that supply side part of the equation that really is supporting values. And it goes back to Econ 101, right? And if you have limited supply, but still net-new demand, that allows prices to appreciate.\\\\nBut I think a lot of people are also hedging. They\\\\u2019re saying, \\\\u201cOkay, you know what? I found the perfect house. It\\\\u2019s one I\\\\u2019ve been wanting to buy forever. It\\\\u2019s now on the market. I know I hate mortgage rates where they are, but I\\\\u2019ll buy now, and I will refinance down the road.\\\\u201d So, the expectation is that rates will come down, and that is really what is supporting home values, at least nationally. Of course, not all markets are created equal. Dave:\\\\nSo, Matthew, we\\\\u2019re sort of talking a little bit around here about affordability, and obviously there are multiple inputs into affordability, so I want to dig into that. But can you just tell our audience a little bit about what affordability means in terms of the housing market, and what are the different variables that make up affordability? Matthew:\\\\nOnly from affordability index, and as you know, a lot of entities are out there that put their own numbers out. And what it really looks at is the ability for a household who\\\\u2019s making an area\\\\u2019s median income, \\\\u201cCan they afford a median priced house based upon the last quarter, last year\\\\u2019s sale price?\\\\u201d Normally, it\\\\u2019s quarterly. So, that really is the math that goes into it. So you\\\\u2019ll know what they\\\\u2019re making, you know what they can borrow, make some assumptions on down payments, taxes, et cetera. But can they afford to buy some or not?\\\\nAnd I think if you look at affordability in general, and quite frankly, it\\\\u2019s something which has been keeping me awake at night for the last 20 odd years. It\\\\u2019s always been an issue because there is a massive undersupply of housing. And so, is housing affordable across the country? It\\\\u2019s not, but I think we\\\\u2019ll probably get to that point in a minute. But in essence, it really looks at relationship between home prices in a location, and how much households are making. Dave:\\\\nThank you for explaining that. And could you tell us a little bit about where affordability is now, in a historical context? Matthew:\\\\nOkay. Well, there\\\\u2019s two groups I look at in terms of the numbers that they put out relative to affordability. One, obviously is the National Association of Realtors. And their affordability index really suggested that a household in America making median income could not afford to buy a medium-priced house starting in May of last year. As we all know, that was when actually a month or so after mortgage rates started to jump massively. Now, although it does say they were technically affordable in two months later on that year, August and December. For the last five months of this year, most recent dates within July, US housing is not technically affordable. That\\\\u2019s across the country.\\\\nNow, there\\\\u2019s another index put out by the National Association of Home Builders. Now, their data, the second quarter of the year, suggests that, 40.5% of homes, both new and resale single-family homes that sold in the second quarter, were affordable. So, that\\\\u2019s less than half. Now, that number\\\\u2019s up from about 38% I believe, in the fourth quarter of last year. But it was the third-lowest level of affordability we\\\\u2019ve seen since they started publishing that report back in what? 2004. So, affordability, certainly in a lot of the country, not everywhere is a major constraint still. And I think that\\\\u2019s likely to continue to be the case. Dave:\\\\nI think affordability comes up a lot, because people look at some of these indices, and they see what you\\\\u2019re showing, that indexes that measure this are at some of the lowest points that they\\\\u2019ve been in multiple decades. And they say, \\\\u201c[inaudible 00:12:23], the housing market has to correct.\\\\u201d This is sort of the thing, like, \\\\u201cLook, this is unsustainable.\\\\u201d Do you believe that? Do you believe that we do need to get back to, let\\\\u2019s say the average affordability of the last 40 years? Or are we sort of in this new normal now, where housing affordability is just lower? Matthew:\\\\nI think about it in terms of the ability not just for household to buy a home, but look at homeownership rates. If going back from 1965 to now on average, 65% of US households own their home, 35% rent, just that is what it is. Sorry, jump up significantly as the housing bubble was forming. And that really kind of started actually in the early 1990s. But anyway, but it really has trended back to that level. So, I don\\\\u2019t think it\\\\u2019s a case that we need to see prices drop, because of course, incomes have not, they continue to go up, that can allow prices to increase. And there\\\\u2019s only really been a couple of times since 1890, I think, we\\\\u2019ve seen a systemic decline in home values.\\\\nSo, I think that that\\\\u2019s unlikely, but the way to address it is really rather simple, more supply. And so that supply can come from two areas. It can come from either the resale market, more people selling? Unlikely. And it can come potentially from investors. Say, \\\\u201cOkay, well, now\\\\u2019s the time for me to cash out. I\\\\u2019ve done very well in having single-family rentals or housing which I\\\\u2019ve owned as an investment.\\\\u201d So, Dave, it can happen that way, but quite frankly, I think it needs to come from the new construction market. We just need to build a lot more. And that in turn, more supply, still a reasonable amount of demand that can allow price growth to slow down pretty significantly, which I think is what\\\\u2019s needed. James:\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s an interesting conversation, because for investors like myself that are buying and producing housing, it also is hard to find inventory right now that you can actually mathematically make sense. We have construction costs are still\\\\u2026 they\\\\u2019re down 10% roughly year-over-year it seems like, but the costs are still outrageous. Getting people to show up is a struggle still. And for investors, you still have to buy product at a certain price, whether it\\\\u2019s land or value-add property. And so when we\\\\u2019re looking at these, we\\\\u2019re like, \\\\u201cWell, okay, we have to put a certain amount of money in, so we still have to sell them for a very high price.\\\\u201d Which is kind of going against the affordability, right? For a lot of us investors, we have to sell it at peak because we\\\\u2019re giving it kind of peak type of product, totally turned.\\\\nAnd as the affordability starts to shrink, do you get concerned that people can\\\\u2019t keep up? Wage growth, they\\\\u2019re predicting that is going to be three to 4% for this year. And that the cost of housing is going up. And I know locally in our Seattle market, I look at what things are selling for and who the buyers are, I\\\\u2019m like, \\\\u201cWow, they are really stretching themselves.\\\\u201d So, if this continues to increase, how are they going to keep up with it with wage growth kind of getting flat, or forecasting being more flat for the next 12 months? Matthew:\\\\nBut, again, you have to look back in time, which is what us economists always do. We try and figure out the future by looking behind us, what happened in the past? Historically across the country, again, going back over a hundred years, house value is got by inflation, just the way it\\\\u2019s always worked. In a couple of periods where that hasn\\\\u2019t quite worked out well, and recently obviously because of where inflation was, that reaction was different. But that is where we\\\\u2019ve seen it. So, ultimately, do I expect to see home values or the pace of growth slow? Yeah.\\\\nBut when you think about pricing, what\\\\u2019s fascinating is the variability. We all talk about every market\\\\u2019s local, right? So, if you think about the coastal markets, do they go up by more than the Midwest of the United States? Of course they do. 15 of the least affordable housing markets in America are where? California. And so it\\\\u2019s quite remarkable. So, where you have a situation, that\\\\u2019s where we are seeing some jurisdictions, some states try and look at, \\\\u201cOkay, well, coastal markets or coastal states are expensive, why?\\\\u201d Lack of land, and also land regulation. Trying to loosen those regulatory constraints, free up more land in order to build more, because their view is, and I agree, that we have to build our way out of this issue.\\\\nBecause we\\\\u2019re not likely to see sales increase or get back up to that six, six and a half million level. And I don\\\\u2019t think we\\\\u2019ll ever see that. If you think about it this way, mortgage rates back in 1980 were what? Almost 20%. But by a decade, it came down from 20% to 12%, to 6%, et cetera. So, as rates come down, people\\\\u2019s buying power increased, and that was therefore their incentive to say, \\\\u201cOkay, it\\\\u2019s time for me to sell, upsize, and move on.\\\\u201d\\\\nBut that would require rates not just dropping back to in the fives, which I think is where they\\\\u2019re going to end up long-term, but continue to drop. And we\\\\u2019re not going to see that, otherwise money will be free, right? So, I think we really have reached that point whereby I don\\\\u2019t expect to see transactions increase beyond the normal demographic scenarios of people downsizing. We know that baby boomers are getting older, but quite frankly, they\\\\u2019re not downsizing at the speed we\\\\u2019d like to see for a couple of reasons. One of which is, they\\\\u2019ve got too much stuff, and the kids, you try and give it to them, it\\\\u2019ll be on eBay next week. So, they\\\\u2019re not downsizing. And so if they\\\\u2019re not downsizing, the move-up buyers, they have limited opportunity. If they\\\\u2019re not moving, then the first-time buyers are shot. And that is the market we really need to start addressing. Dave:\\\\nWell, just as an anecdotal evidence, there\\\\u2019s a, I won\\\\u2019t name, a group in my family. Some boomers who sold their house to, quote, unquote, \\\\u201cdownsize.\\\\u201d And they wound up buying a five-bedroom house that was bigger than their earlier one. So, I think just in my personal experience, I\\\\u2019ve seen that myself. Matthew:\\\\nAnd they do that because they think that all the kids are going to come back and visit with them. No, they\\\\u2019re not. Dave:\\\\nHonestly, that is the number one thing. They want everyone in one house at the same time. Which I understand, but that\\\\u2019s like a use case of maybe one time per year, or every other year. Matthew:\\\\nExactly. Dave:\\\\nAnd now they\\\\u2019re taking up all this housing. That\\\\u2019s a whole other sociological discussion. But I just want to sort of recap what you were saying before, about rates and going down. You were saying that, \\\\u201cYou didn\\\\u2019t think we\\\\u2019re going to get to that transaction volume of six million again.\\\\u201d I just want to make sure I understand. You\\\\u2019re basically saying that the incentive to transact as rates fell by decade, kept going down and down and down. We might never reach another point where there is as strong an incentive for people to move up, or to trade, or transact. And therefore we may have hit, at least for the foreseeable future, sort of the peak amount of home sales that are going to happen in any given month or year. Is that what you\\\\u2019re saying? Matthew:\\\\nYeah, I think you\\\\u2019re right. I think by my forecast, this year will probably be around 4.3 million, horrible number. Been decades since we last drove that low. Dave:\\\\nYeah, low. Matthew:\\\\nNext year, I\\\\u2019d be surprised if we broke above five million. I think we\\\\u2019ll get close to it, 4.8, maybe 4.85. So, I think kind of five million is somewhere where, which we could have a certain level of comfort going forward. But more than that, again, just logically speaking, and mathematically speaking, I think I will be surprised to see us get back to those heady levels we saw. But also remember, through the pandemic, what were we doing? We were booking out of large cities, where it\\\\u2019d be Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and moving to Austin, Idaho, Boise, these kinds of markets. So, that really, I think pulled a lot of that demand forward already.\\\\nSo, because of that, in addition to the fact that I just don\\\\u2019t see\\\\u2026 We said we\\\\u2019re going to see rates drop over time, probably not. Anyone that thinks we\\\\u2019re going to get back to a 3%, 30 again, I think is going to be waiting a very long time. Because unless the Fed jumps in again, that\\\\u2019s the reason why we had rates sub-3 anyway. Then if that doesn\\\\u2019t occur, again, it just doesn\\\\u2019t work out because always rates have to have a relationship with the yield on 10-year treasuries. So, that means the yield on 10-year paper is going to be down around 1%, not going to happen. James:\\\\nSo, Matthew, with the sale volume being\\\\u2026 that\\\\u2019s almost two million less homes being sold. You talked about earlier, that it was about 70-30 with the renters, or 65-35 with renters versus homeowners. Do you see that switching over the next 12 to 24 months, to where, as new buyers come in, they\\\\u2019re just more comfortable being renters because there\\\\u2019s no product to buy? And are we looking at an America that could go 50-50 renter versus ownership? Matthew:\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t think so. And I think that most home buyers or would be home buyers\\\\u2026 If you think about it demographically, everyone talks about millennials, right? Well, they\\\\u2019re getting older. As they\\\\u2019re aging out, a lot of them are turning 40 now. But I\\\\u2019m looking at, let\\\\u2019s say my son, Gen Z behind them. And, well, almost 70% of them believe that buying a home will be the most astute financial investment they\\\\u2019ll ever make. And I know the Fed, every three years, comes out with an analysis, so I\\\\u2019m actually waiting on the latest one, which shows the median household wealth of a homeowner household versus a renter household. And the last numbers are 2019, and if memory serves me right, I think they said the median household wealth, a homeowner household was around quarter of a million dollars, and a renter household around $6,000.\\\\nSo, I can extrapolate that out to today easily, we\\\\u2019re looking at an owner household across America has a net wealth of probably around 320,000 renter, about eight. So, it\\\\u2019s the way a majority of Americans create their wealth is through long-term ownership of housing. Is it for everyone? Of course no, it\\\\u2019s not. But I think it is still a goal of a sizable part of our not just growing population, but aging population. I think about the young kids in college today. James:\\\\nAnd it kind of shows the sign of the times. Because I remember after the 2008 crash, it was like nine, 10, and 11. The younger population had this negative stigma on owning a house, right? Their parents had just been foreclosed. Everyone was losing their properties, no one wanted real estate at all. They\\\\u2019re like, \\\\u201cThat is a terrible thing to own.\\\\u201d And now you have these Gen Zs coming up, and they saw all this growth, and people having all this success. And I do feel like the first-time home buyer\\\\u2026 I was actually talking to my title rep the other day, who works for a very large title company, Fidelity National Title. And he said, \\\\u201c50% of all transactions that they\\\\u2019re doing right now are first-time home buyers.\\\\u201d\\\\nAnd so I think that is been ingrained into that\\\\u2026 If you want to make it in America, you have to buy that house. And so there\\\\u2019s going to be sacrifice for your house payment. But it\\\\u2019s crazy how much of a switch it is from watching the young buyers back then. And they were incentivized, they had that first-time home buyer credit back then, it was a great product, and people still didn\\\\u2019t want it. And now people are just taking the leap on where pricing is at right now. Matthew:\\\\nI mean, education is everything, right? I think people who have watched The Big Short, people who watched a lot of these movies that came out about the housing bubble, and there are three of them which are very good. So, I think it comes down to education, and the understanding of what happened back then. The genesis of the housing bubble under Clinton in the early \\\\u201990s, all the way through Bush, et cetera, et cetera, is something which is unlikely to happen now. You think about it. Last week was the anniversary of Lehman Brothers filing a bankruptcy, which was the biggest filing in US history.\\\\nSo, yes, there\\\\u2019s a lot of negative connotations, but I think people understand that what happened then is very unlikely to happen again. And they\\\\u2019re also seeing the fact that, yeah, they can own their house, guess what? They can paint their walls. It\\\\u2019s also forced savings. Through mortgage payment, a little piece of that pie comes out paying down principle, the tax benefits, et cetera, et cetera, all the things that everyone is aware of. So, I think they\\\\u2019re seeing that today and saying, \\\\u201cYeah, I really think that that is the way I want to go rather than renting, and what am I doing? Paying somebody else\\\\u2019s mortgage.\\\\u201d Dave:\\\\nThere are a lot of, Matthew, analysis now though that show that if you are a renter, and actually take the\\\\u2026 It\\\\u2019s sort of this hypothetical, right? So, if you had the money to make a down payment, and instead of buying a home, you rented and invested, say in the stock market and earned eight to 9% or whatever. Or perhaps invested in a rental property instead of a primary residence, that you would actually do better. And I actually do that myself. I rent and invest my money into rental properties, because you actually earn a better return in some markets. It depends on where you are. But I was just curious of your thoughts on that. Matthew:\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s talk about the stock market first, or investing in equities. And I\\\\u2019m assuming equities, let me not talk about crypto because I\\\\u2019m- Dave:\\\\nNope. Matthew:\\\\nI\\\\u2019m kind of the Charlie Munger viewer in that respect, but- Dave:\\\\nNot for James or I at least. Matthew:\\\\nYeah, well, the first thing I\\\\u2019d say is very simple, capital gains taxes. So, you\\\\u2019d have to remember, as a married household, the first $500,000 in upside, in terms of the increased value of that home, tax-free. Dave:\\\\nTax free. Matthew:\\\\nNow, are the equities you\\\\u2019re buying going to be tax-free? Guess what? No, they\\\\u2019re not. They\\\\u2019re now 30-plus percent on those. So, there is that. And again, in addition to that, you\\\\u2019re paying down your mortgage, et cetera, et cetera, depending on obviously how long you are there. But more than anything else, it\\\\u2019s shelter, and it\\\\u2019s yours. Now, certainly as you said, Dave, \\\\u201cThere are people like yourselves, where it makes more sense for them to still invest in real estate.\\\\u201d Now, I could argue, you could still see, if you choose to sell that unit, the same issue regarding capital gains unless you made it your principal primary residence. Unless you kind of moved into it for a while. Dave:\\\\nRight. Matthew:\\\\nBut subject to that, yeah, I think that can be for some, a viable option. Again, depending on where in the country you are. But for most people, the stock market every day, it certainly acts like a petulant child more often than not. Yes, you can see those swings, those upsides, but you also can see downside as well. And is it more likely to see a recession, therefore a contraction in equity prices? Or is it as likely you\\\\u2019ll see a contraction in home values? Dave:\\\\nYeah. Matthew:\\\\nYou\\\\u2019ve only seen a couple of downsides in home values. Dave:\\\\nNo. Yeah, yeah, totally. Way less volatility, for sure. Matthew:\\\\nSo, again, it\\\\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all scenario at all. But I think in general market, it would be those that are saying, \\\\u201cYou\\\\u2019re better off if you\\\\u2019d invested in, I don\\\\u2019t know, Tesla or something.\\\\u201d I would say, \\\\u201cYes today, maybe not six months ago.\\\\u201d But you could say that. But I think that\\\\u2019s more cherry-picking than anything else. If you just get into an index fund, okay. I\\\\u2019d actually never seen anyone living under a stock certificate. James:\\\\nYeah, so Matthew, you made kind of a good point, right? \\\\u201cThat real estate can be a lot less volatile and more dependable than the stock market,\\\\u201d which I truly do believe. I seem to lose money on stock market, and crypto, and anything else besides real estate. Not that you can\\\\u2019t lose money in real estate too. So, I do believe that. But in the climate that we\\\\u2019re in right now, there\\\\u2019s obviously risk in every type of asset class. What should we be wary of, as real estate investors? Like right now, we\\\\u2019re out trying to buy properties to sell them for profit, keep them as rental properties. What should investors be looking out for right now, as they\\\\u2019re looking at buying that next investment? Because we\\\\u2019re all eager to buy, but we\\\\u2019re a little bit cautious right now. Matthew:\\\\nI think that there\\\\u2019s some things which actually you gentlemen have already mentioned. And that is the fact that, is it a market that you can buy a house, and knowing that the rent you\\\\u2019ll be able to achieve having bought it? Is there a yield there? I mean, there\\\\u2019s a reason why institutional investors, obviously not mom-and-pop investors, which although that comprises a vast majority of the market, have they been pulling back significantly? Absolutely. I mean, they\\\\u2019re still active in a couple of markets, but generally not.\\\\nSo, I would say that the first thing to do is, you know what you\\\\u2019re borrowing, you know what your payment\\\\u2019s going to be, your rents are going to be. Does that make sense today or does it not? And so I think that\\\\u2019s one of the first things. Secondly, I\\\\u2019d look at the market. And is it a market that you could potentially see some additional price erosion from where we are today? And I think in the past, I guess, [inaudible 00:28:48] you\\\\u2019ve talked about markets which are still of a concern, Austin, Texas is obviously one. I\\\\u2019d say Boise, Idaho is another one. James:\\\\nWe love beating up on those markets too. Matthew:\\\\nEveryone does right now, quite frankly. It really is kind of scary. But there are markets which, and certainly Boise, which go back 15, 20 years, no one really wanted to be there. But it\\\\u2019s funny, it\\\\u2019s an area of last time\\\\u2026 I go there every year now. I had to give a speech. And it reminds me of a scaled-down gas stamp district in San Diego. It\\\\u2019s kind of hip, it\\\\u2019s got some good restaurants, and distilleries, and breweries. It\\\\u2019s got the most amazing convention center that\\\\u2019s built by a company, and then given to the city for nothing. Great regional airport. So, I think it\\\\u2019s got some good things going to it. However, a couple of years ago, you could have bought a nice house for a bit north of quarter of a million dollars. Today, we\\\\u2019re talking north of $600,000. And that again is because of that massive flight out of some of the more expensive markets, not just here in the Northwest, but very specifically California.\\\\nSo a couple of things that I just mentioned, one of which is there a yield? Does it make financial sense, or is it costing you money? And that would therefore mean, start looking at high property tax states and these kinds of things. Is it a market that potentially can see some further price erosion, then you might want to wait before you jump in? So, those I think are the two things that stick out to me. But in terms of being an investor and where prices are, we started out talking about affordability. We are creating a lot, a forced renter households that would like to buy, they just can\\\\u2019t. And not just the young kids that weren\\\\u2019t quite ready to move out of their apartment, they hadn\\\\u2019t got a down payment ready. All they\\\\u2019ve done is see prices go up and mortgage rates double.\\\\nBut you look at a lot of families. Everyone assumes that if you\\\\u2019re a family, then you rent an apartment. No, you don\\\\u2019t, you rent a single-family home. And so these are people that might want to get their foot on the first rung of the ladder, just can\\\\u2019t make it work. They need somewhere to live. And so, again, shelter at the long-term, is always going to be a good investment. But the worry, again, comes back to affordability. So, I\\\\u2019d say just look at the markets in which you\\\\u2019re choosing or you\\\\u2019re thinking about investing in. Don\\\\u2019t bite off more than you can chew, don\\\\u2019t overleverage. All the things I would say to somebody who\\\\u2019s looking to buy a home for themselves. Dave:\\\\nYeah, it\\\\u2019s really a lot of the same fundamentals that we were saying. Matthew, before we get out of here, this has been a fascinating conversation, and thank you. Is there anything else you think that our audience, primarily of those small mom-and-pop investors you just talked about, should know about the market, or factor into their decision-making over the next year? Matthew:\\\\nYeah, I would say that when it comes to\\\\u2026 Everyone\\\\u2019s looking at mortgage rates, we started talking about it. But from my end, I\\\\u2019m talking about it. Are we going to see them continue to skyrocket? I think that that is highly unlikely. But as they come down, and I expect they will. And in fact, I think we\\\\u2019ll be down probably in the mid-fives by the latter part of next year. Just calm down, it\\\\u2019s going to be okay. We\\\\u2019re just in a very unique situation right now. The Fed\\\\u2019s trying to cool inflation, and in some respects, it\\\\u2019s working. But the resilience of the US economy has been remarkable. That is not a good thing in terms of investors or indeed analysts like myself who try and forecast mortgage rates, because we should be slowing down a bit more, but that is not the case.\\\\nHowever, we could overshoot, or they could overshoot, keep rates higher longer, that could lead to a recession. Not a good feeling for any of us, however, good for mortgage rates, because they will drop faster than I\\\\u2019m anticipating. So, I think really it is, we are in a situation now coming out of COVID, that we hadn\\\\u2019t seen before in a century. No one wrote the book about it, about what was going to happen. The world is a very different place. So, I think we just need to figure that out, and let\\\\u2019s let the seas calm down somewhat, which I think they will. But do I always think that in the right circumstance, again, not over-leveraging yourself, is owning real estate as an investment or as somewhere in which you live a good investment? Historically, it has been. And again, as an economist, I tend to look at history, not to forecast the future, I do not see that changing. But just be patient, in time, things will settle down. Dave:\\\\nAll right, great. Well, thank you so much, Matthew, for being here. We really appreciate it. If people want to follow your research, check out your incredible in-depth reports, where should they do that? Matthew:\\\\nWell, thank you. So, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. It\\\\u2019s mgardnerecon. So, mgardner, G-A-R-D-N-E-R, econ, E-C-O-N. LinkedIn, mjdgardner. And that\\\\u2019s where we put out all of our analysis. Dave:\\\\nAll right. Well, thanks again for being here. We really appreciate it. Matthew:\\\\nDavid, James, pleasure. James:\\\\nYeah, thanks, Matthew. Matthew:\\\\nYou\\\\u2019re welcome. Dave:\\\\nWell, I see why you wanted to have Matthew come on the show here, James. What\\\\u2019d you think of our conversation? James:\\\\nOh, I loved it. I mean, it was great for him to just talk about the affordability, because we\\\\u2019re all worried about this. As investors, are we going to get to a price point where no one\\\\u2019s going to buy or no one\\\\u2019s going to rent? And so it was just good to get some perspective on it. But being a Pacific Northwest guy, we listen to Matthew Gardner all the time as the chief economist for Windermere. And every time he speaks, it\\\\u2019s always a little piece of gold. Dave:\\\\nI mean, there was a lot in there. And I think what he was talking about in terms of affordability really extends beyond even the expensive state. Quote, unquote, \\\\u201cexpensive areas,\\\\u201d like obviously where you are in Seattle, we talked a lot about California. But most of the country now falls under the quote, unquote, \\\\u201cunaffordable area.\\\\u201d Even the places people are moving in the southeast in Florida and Tennessee, and in a lot of areas of Texas, the median income cannot afford the median price home in those places.\\\\nAnd I think that, for good reason, has\\\\u2026 People have point to that and said, \\\\u201cHey, things have to come back to normal.\\\\u201d But according to Matthew, that\\\\u2019s not necessarily true. As long as supply is as low as it is, it apparently can stay up. And I think that\\\\u2019s a really interesting thing that I\\\\u2019ve debated with many people, because no one knows for sure. But I think Matthew brought us some really interesting perspectives on this, and whether or not we\\\\u2019re going to have to see an improvement in affordability in the near future here. James:\\\\nAnd after we were getting done talking, I mean, for me, in the back of my mind, I was like, \\\\u201cI think rent has some more growth in it.\\\\u201d Dave:\\\\nYou do? James:\\\\nFor some reason, it\\\\u2019s like if pricing keeps going up and people seem to just be making this payment, and sales are so far down, you\\\\u2019re going to have to rent in the short term until you find that house. And so it could push rents up a little bit more. Dave:\\\\nYeah, I think it\\\\u2019s certain markets. I just feel like there\\\\u2019s this big pull-forward, and household formation is just slowing down. All these people did the COVID breakup basically, like roommates, everyone wanted to go their own way. And so it just created more renter households, and that fueled a lot of the rent growth. And I don\\\\u2019t think it\\\\u2019s necessarily going backwards, but I think that all that juice that was in rent for a while might be slowing down. But we\\\\u2019ll see. I don\\\\u2019t necessarily think\\\\u2026 Rents are sticky, so I don\\\\u2019t think they\\\\u2019re going to slide a lot. But I personally, if I\\\\u2019m looking at deals right now, I underwrite pretty slow rent growth. Are you in your deals putting in rent growth, or is this a revelation you had today? James:\\\\nNo, very minimum. I think anything we\\\\u2019re looking at, we\\\\u2019re being very conservative. Whether it\\\\u2019s a value rent growth, we\\\\u2019re sticking it pretty flat. But there\\\\u2019s certain areas that I\\\\u2019m watching and I\\\\u2019m like, \\\\u201cWell, there could be some rent growth.\\\\u201d It really comes down to what is the cost for rent versus buying? And certain areas are way out of whack. And so we\\\\u2019re still underwriting with low growth, but I think the upside\\\\u2019s there. Dave:\\\\nYeah, exactly. If you underwrite, find a good deal with no rent growth and then it grows, then it\\\\u2019s good to be wrong. James:\\\\nYes. Dave:\\\\nAll right. Well, thanks a lot, man.

While this sounds like a simple, straightforward process to verify income, there\\\\u2019s trouble lurking in the form of a fake pay stub.\\\\u00a0 Indeed, some try to create pay stubs online to create fake proof of income.\\\\u00a0 Simple Signs to Spot Fake Pay Stubs Knowing how to spot fake pay stubs can save you from a lot of hassle in the future. Here are seven signs you should look for to check stubs.\\\\u00a0 1. Inconsistencies in numbers and data One of the most glaring signs of counterfeit stubs is inconsistent data. This may appear as miscalculations regarding a pay period, uneven totals, or discrepancies between gross pay and net pay. With a real pay stub, employers generally use standardized payroll software that automates calculations and creates pay stubs. This almost guarantees mathematical accuracy.\\\\u00a0 If the numbers don\\\\u2019t add up or if deductions don\\\\u2019t seem to correlate with the gross pay, take caution. You may be dealing with fake pay stubs.\\\\u00a0 2. Missing standard information A real pay stub will provide comprehensive details, including the employer\\\\u2019s name, address, employee identification number, and more. If any of this standard information is missing or appears generic, it\\\\u2019s a red flag for a fake pay stub. It\\\\u2019s also essential to cross-check the employer\\\\u2019s details provided with public records or directories to ensure legitimacy.       3. Poor quality or formatting Professional payroll software generates clear, organized, easy-to-read pay stubs. On the other hand, fake pay stubs may exhibit signs of poor quality, such as misaligned columns, varying fonts, or spelling errors.\\\\u00a0 Any obvious formatting issues or lack of uniformity in presentation could be a telltale sign of a forged document. 4. Absence of deductions Real pay stubs will showcase a variety of deductions, such as insurance deductions, Medicare taxes, Social Security taxes, and retirement contributions. If a pay stub lacks these deductions or if the amounts seem unusually low or high, proceed with caution.\\\\u00a0 Cross-reference against federal, state, and local tax rates for accuracy. This can help you quickly uncover fake stubs. 5. Too good to be true Sometimes, a pay stub might display exceptionally high earnings or bonuses that don\\\\u2019t match the applicant\\\\u2019s job title or industry standards. While everyone loves a success story, it\\\\u2019s crucial to remain realistic.\\\\u00a0 Conduct market research or consult industry guides for salary information to determine the average pay for specific roles and compare them to what\\\\u2019s presented on the pay stub. 6. Confusion between O and zero When the letter O replaces the number 0, it\\\\u2019s a strong indication of a fake pay stub. Companies employing payroll software rarely make this oversight. Authentic documents often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion. 7. Suspiciously rounded figures Alarm bells should ring when all earnings on a pay stub are perfectly rounded. For instance, seeing net pay as a rounded number like $1,500 instead of $1,498.05 is unusual, as precise payroll calculations seldom result in such neat figures. While these aren\\\\u2019t the only ways to spot a fake pay stub, they\\\\u2019re more than enough to point you in the right direction. The more tenants you screen, the easier it is to implement a strategy for reviewing pay stubs for suspicious activity. Other Ways You Can Verify Tenant Employment While requesting a pay stub is the most common way to verify potential tenant employment and provide proof of income, there are other options available to you: Direct employer verification One of the most reliable methods is to directly contact the prospective tenant\\\\u2019s employer. Ask the tenant for the name and contact information of their immediate supervisor or the HR department. Once received, give them a call to verify employment status, verify income, and verify tenure.\\\\u00a0 Tip: Ensure you\\\\u2019re speaking to a legitimate representative of the company, not a friend or relative posing as an employer. Request additional documentation Beyond pay stubs that can help with income verification, there are other forms of documentation that can provide evidence of employment and earnings.

While this sounds like a simple, straightforward process to verify income, there\\\\u2019s trouble lurking in the form of a fake pay stub.\\\\u00a0 Indeed, some try to create pay stubs online to create fake proof of income.\\\\u00a0 Simple Signs to Spot Fake Pay Stubs Knowing how to spot fake pay stubs can save you from a lot of hassle in the future. Here are seven signs you should look for to check stubs.\\\\u00a0 1. Inconsistencies in numbers and data One of the most glaring signs of counterfeit stubs is inconsistent data. This may appear as miscalculations regarding a pay period, uneven totals, or discrepancies between gross pay and net pay. With a real pay stub, employers generally use standardized payroll software that automates calculations and creates pay stubs. This almost guarantees mathematical accuracy.\\\\u00a0 If the numbers don\\\\u2019t add up or if deductions don\\\\u2019t seem to correlate with the gross pay, take caution. You may be dealing with fake pay stubs.\\\\u00a0 2. Missing standard information A real pay stub will provide comprehensive details, including the employer\\\\u2019s name, address, employee identification number, and more. If any of this standard information is missing or appears generic, it\\\\u2019s a red flag for a fake pay stub. It\\\\u2019s also essential to cross-check the employer\\\\u2019s details provided with public records or directories to ensure legitimacy.       3. Poor quality or formatting Professional payroll software generates clear, organized, easy-to-read pay stubs. On the other hand, fake pay stubs may exhibit signs of poor quality, such as misaligned columns, varying fonts, or spelling errors.\\\\u00a0 Any obvious formatting issues or lack of uniformity in presentation could be a telltale sign of a forged document. 4. Absence of deductions Real pay stubs will showcase a variety of deductions, such as insurance deductions, Medicare taxes, Social Security taxes, and retirement contributions. If a pay stub lacks these deductions or if the amounts seem unusually low or high, proceed with caution.\\\\u00a0 Cross-reference against federal, state, and local tax rates for accuracy. This can help you quickly uncover fake stubs. 5. Too good to be true Sometimes, a pay stub might display exceptionally high earnings or bonuses that don\\\\u2019t match the applicant\\\\u2019s job title or industry standards. While everyone loves a success story, it\\\\u2019s crucial to remain realistic.\\\\u00a0 Conduct market research or consult industry guides for salary information to determine the average pay for specific roles and compare them to what\\\\u2019s presented on the pay stub. 6. Confusion between O and zero When the letter O replaces the number 0, it\\\\u2019s a strong indication of a fake pay stub. Companies employing payroll software rarely make this oversight. Authentic documents often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion. 7. Suspiciously rounded figures Alarm bells should ring when all earnings on a pay stub are perfectly rounded. For instance, seeing net pay as a rounded number like $1,500 instead of $1,498.05 is unusual, as precise payroll calculations seldom result in such neat figures. While these aren\\\\u2019t the only ways to spot a fake pay stub, they\\\\u2019re more than enough to point you in the right direction. The more tenants you screen, the easier it is to implement a strategy for reviewing pay stubs for suspicious activity. Other Ways You Can Verify Tenant Employment While requesting a pay stub is the most common way to verify potential tenant employment and provide proof of income, there are other options available to you: Direct employer verification One of the most reliable methods is to directly contact the prospective tenant\\\\u2019s employer. Ask the tenant for the name and contact information of their immediate supervisor or the HR department. Once received, give them a call to verify employment status, verify income, and verify tenure.\\\\u00a0 Tip: Ensure you\\\\u2019re speaking to a legitimate representative of the company, not a friend or relative posing as an employer. Request additional documentation Beyond pay stubs that can help with income verification, there are other forms of documentation that can provide evidence of employment and earnings. These can include tax returns, bank statements, or employment contracts.\\\\u00a0 While these documents can also be falsified, cross-referencing multiple documents can help paint a clearer picture of a tenant\\\\u2019s financial situation. Note: Since independent contractors don\\\\u2019t receive standard pay stubs, it\\\\u2019s critical to request additional documentation. Requesting proof of income is a must.\\\\u00a0 Online employment verification services Several online companies offer employment verification services.

This is one of the quickest and most time-efficient ways to verify employment and ensure that you\\\\u2019re not trusting a fake document for income verification.\\\\u00a0 Check professional social networks Platforms like LinkedIn can give insights into a person\\\\u2019s employment history and current status.

For others, this can be paying rent via checks versus online payments. The key is having a good grasp on how your tenants feel about both the rental property and adjusting where necessary.\\\\u00a0 But exactly how can this be done?

For those starting out in real estate investing, you may be surprised to hear that not all lenders are open to working with investors. Real estate financing plays a significant role in the success of a rental property. Loan terms like mortgage payments, interest rates, or even down payments for a property can make or break you financially.\\\\u00a0 What does it mean to have an investor-friendly lender on your side, and where do you find one?\\\\u00a0 What Is an Investor-Friendly Lender? An investor-friendly lender is familiar with the real estate market and focuses on a property\\\\u2019s potential, rather than honing in on the current market value. Let\\\\u2019s say you\\\\u2019re just venturing into real estate investing. You go to a bank and explain that you want to buy a property, specifically in commercial real estate. To your surprise, the bank shuts you down. Your confidence is shot, and you think every lender will say no to your potential investments. It\\\\u2019s time to find an investor-friendly lender. A conventional lender, usually a big bank like Wells Fargo or Chase, is typically unwilling to give you money for an investment like a rental property because it\\\\u2019s more of a risk to them. Instead, they tend to focus on financing primary residences. A private money lender is one example of a more investor-friendly lender because they consider a property\\\\u2019s future value and provide a loan against it, compared to more conventional lenders. Also, private lenders, or smaller lenders and their loan programs, tend to be under less of a microscope, meaning investors typically have fewer hoops to jump through. If a private money lender doesn\\\\u2019t work out for you and you need something quick without all the hustle and bustle of conventional loans, try a portfolio lender. Consider a portfolio mortgage lender if you want to bypass all the super-strict borrower requirements set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A portfolio loan allows the investor to purchase multiple properties as well. An investment property loan is very different from a conventional loan. Banks, especially local banks, love lending to those looking to finance a primary residence. The Best Ways to Find an Investor-Friendly Lender Finding an investor-friendly lender that works for you is essential. Your relationship with your lender is crucial for any potential properties you want to invest in. Here are some ways to find an investor-friendly lender. Lender Finder Technology is inevitable, and every day, more tools are being added to the real estate tech stack to help organize and simplify your next investment. Lender Finder from BiggerPockets allows you to enter details like the property\\\\u2019s location, possibly even an address if you have one, what you want to purchase the property for, and so much more. Once the details are entered, the tool will search its database for investor-friendly lenders for you to reach out to. There is also an option to request that the lender contact you for more details. You can find a lender within minutes using Lender Finder. BiggerPockets forums Posts from BiggerPockets members within the forums ask for advice on local lenders and even basics like what interest rate to look for, the best investment property loans to get, the minimum down payment terms, and more. An experienced investor in your area can usually guide you in the right direction for a lender near you, as well as one that will best fit what you want to do. For example, do you have a rental property in mind? Get advice on which lenders to look for in your rental property\\\\u2019s location. Interested in commercial property? Find a commercial lender that best suits your needs. Local networking From your local real estate group to something on Meetup.com, it\\\\u2019s crucial to network locally with people in the real estate industry. Interested in learning more about rental property loans? Find a local investor who owns multiple rental properties and can tell you the ins and outs of financing and owning a rental property. After being gung ho on networking this year, I can tell you that the real estate industry and the connections within the industry are intertwined. Real estate agents, for example, have a ton of connections, from financing to insurance to property leads, so an agent tends to be an all-in-one connection. I\\\\u2019ve also met mortgage brokers at local events who, despite being unable to finance your deal, can link you up with a lender who can. Maybe at a networking event, you meet other local investors who can refer you a contractor they love to work with or even recommend a local investor-friendly lender that would love to finance your next potential deal. Cold calling Picking up the phone can create a more personable connection than sending a text or an email. It allows both parties to get to know each other in a way that no 25-text thread ever could. So, where do you start, and who do you even cold call? If you\\\\u2019re not one to be out and about and picking up the phone feels more comfortable, call local real estate investors currently killing it in your area. An experienced real estate investor will quickly have a list of investor-friendly lenders you should or should not contact. When cold calling, don\\\\u2019t be afraid to chat with multiple lenders or mortgage brokers because each one will have different terms. Be sure to ask a potential lender how many loans you can have at once, the loan minimum for a property, and what kind of loans they specialize in, be it rehab loans, portfolio loans, or something else. Remember, the type of property, whether residential or commercial real estate, plays a significant role in the kind of financing you get. Social media Social media is no longer just a place to post pictures of friends or family\\\\u2014it\\\\u2019s perfect for networking too, especially when looking for investor-friendly lenders. For example, an investor could easily request lender recommendations from local investors. There are 4.8 billion social media users worldwide, representing 59.9% of the global population and 92.7% of all internet users. Imagine all the research opportunities there to find a lender that best works for you. Google Aside from research on a social platform or chatting with the local REI group, Google is officially its own beast. And as you know, it offers an exponential, sometimes overwhelming amount of information. When looking for a lender, read any Google reviews associated with the lender\\\\u2019s business or name. Google reviews are a great way to gain insight into people\\\\u2019s thoughts without actually having a conversation. If the lender has a website, you can search the different loan programs and the type of investment, like a rental property, on which the lender offers terms. Also, remember that the loan minimum depends on the property type. Benefits of Working With an Investor-Friendly Lender An investor-friendly lender has so much to offer to real estate investors. Let\\\\u2019s dive into the benefits of working with a lender who\\\\u2019s just as into real estate investing as you are. Simplicity Applying for a loan isn\\\\u2019t simple, but when looking for an investment property loan, it\\\\u2019s essential to consider the hoops you\\\\u2019ll have to jump through to get the loan in the first place. Many real estate deals are time-sensitive, so it\\\\u2019s essential to find a lender that doesn\\\\u2019t have a lengthy approval process. An investor-friendly lender doesn\\\\u2019t have the super-strict loan guidelines of conventional loans. These lenders also tend to be just as optimistic about an investment as the investor. What more could you ask for? Speed Investor-friendly lenders understand that the speed and approval of funds makes all the difference for real estate investors. These lenders are typically private investors, hard money lenders, sometimes portfolio lenders, or even private lenders. Time is of the essence for many real estate investors when buying property, especially if it\\\\u2019s an immediate cash flow property. An investor-friendly lender can make quick decisions on investment properties and provide the necessary funding within an acceptable time frame. Convenience Investor-friendly lenders seem to appreciate and acknowledge a real estate investor\\\\u2019s time by being overly accessible, whether handling documentation online so that their real estate investor client doesn\\\\u2019t have to make an extra trip or being readily available. These lenders nurture a client relationship and are overtly optimistic about their client\\\\u2019s investing future. Plus, their loan programs offer a more customized approach to financing something like a flip or a rental property. Flexibility Need a lower down payment or more leniency on cash flow? An investor-friendly lender works with you to customize a loan deal that will be best where you are financially now and not drain you entirely from where you want to be. You may need a lower minimum down payment to dedicate more cash to your investment. The nice thing about lenders on your side is that they work with you, not against you. Sure, it may mean higher interest rates for now, but if you get something like a rental property going that starts raking in reasonable cash flow, those loan terms will be old news. Ready to Connect With an Investor-Friendly Lender? Whether investing in rental properties or commercial real estate, connecting with investor-friendly lenders makes all the difference when running a real estate business. Investment property loans, especially for a newbie investor, might be confusing. If the end goal is to invest in multiple properties within the next few years, it\\\\u2019s essential to create a dynamic professional relationship with a lender. It\\\\u2019s essential to have a lender who offers the right loan programs, understands your needs, and works within them to give you the best possible outcome. Is a portfolio loan the best financing for your next investment? Having these conversations with a finance professional you trust is important.\\\\u00a0Before teaming up with a lender, real estate investors must do their due diligence. Each lender will have something different to offer, so choose a lender whose loan terms work best for you.

Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Properties Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Properties With the relentless rise of interest rates in the past couple of years, investors searching for cash flow have struggled to find workable deals without being forced to commit to cash purchases or ultra-low leverage (which severely crimps the ability to scale). With the dearth of SFR (single-family rentals) available to provide cash flow as home values have stubbornly stayed elevated, even in the face of rising rates, investors have been pushed in alternative directions. For many, this has meant moving toward short-term vacation rentals, multiunit properties, or other creative forms of dealmaking.

The problem? Many (if not all) current DSCR lenders and their capital partners are hesitant to lend on these properties, even if the investment is solid. Many are burdened with the connotation of boarding houses or believe that the tenant mix may be low-quality and risky (many halfway houses operate in this way) or that the type of tenant who can only afford a room in a group home may have greater risks of missing rent or having other issues.

With manufactured housing, there is a heightened risk the property could be moved. While these properties are typically fixed to the land with a foundation and other permanent aspects, the properties were initially manufactured and moved to the site so they could, in many cases, be moved again. A borrower in default who could move the collateral is a problem for lenders because they could get around foreclosure, and the lender would take a large loss.

How can DSCR lenders solve this problem? Some options include leverage limits (lower LTVs available) to protect against risk and to require features and aspects that tie the home to the land, such as foundation requirements. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, the lender can require an affidavit filed with the county that legally restricts the ability to move the collateral and to classify the property as real estate.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 How can DSCR lenders solve this problem?

How much you can borrow (the credit limit) is replenished when you repay the money you borrow.\\\\u00a0 HELOCs are offered by banks, credit unions, loan brokers, and online lenders. Similar to credit cards, HELOCs can be used for nearly any purpose, although they are most commonly used for home remodeling projects or home additions. Some people also use them to consolidate credit card debt. Borrowing from a HELOC is very easy. Most lenders provide debit cards or checkbooks that let you make quick withdrawals. You can draw from the account as often as you like, as long as you don\\\\u2019t go over the credit limit.\\\\u00a0 Unlike traditional loans, HELOCs don\\\\u2019t have fixed monthly payments. Instead, you can make interest-only payments for as long as the account is open (the draw period). If the borrowed money isn\\\\u2019t repaid by the end of the draw period, a balloon payment may be required for the full amount due.\\\\u00a0 Some lenders may give you the option of converting the balance into a traditional loan with a fixed repayment term and regular monthly payments. The typical HELOC draw period is 10 years, followed by a 20-year repayment period. HELOCs also have variable interest rates, which means you will need to know the current interest rate every time you borrow money. A home equity line of credit will also have closing costs, which may be 2% to 5% of the credit limit. How to Get a HELOC Obtaining a home equity line of credit is simple and can be completed in the following steps. 1. Assess your equity The amount of equity you will need for a HELOC varies depending on the lender, but is usually a minimum of 15% to 20%. Equity is the current market value of your home less the amount you owe on it.\\\\u00a0 If the current market value of your home is $300,000, for example, and you still owe $200,000 on your mortgage, you have $100,000 in equity. 2. Research lenders Before you officially apply for a HELOC, it\\\\u2019s a good idea to research multiple lenders to compare different interest rates, fees, and terms and conditions. This lets you determine which option is the best deal. 3. Apply for a HELOC After you have selected a lender, fill out the HELOC application to start the loan approval process. Your lender may require an appraisal of your property to determine its current market value and verify your equity.\\\\u00a0 To ensure you can repay the money you borrow, your lender may seek additional information to verify your employment and financial information. 4. Close on the loan Similar to mortgages, home equity lines of credit must go through the closing process before you can start borrowing money. At the closing, you will sign the HELOC agreement and other documents. After the account is established, you can start making withdrawals from your new credit line.       How Much Money Can I Borrow With a HELOC? How much you can borrow with a HELOC is based on the amount of equity you have in your home, your credit score, and your current debts. Lenders will also look at your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Depending on the lender, the amount you can borrow with a HELOC may be up to 85% of your equity. Let\\\\u2019s say your home\\\\u2019s current market value is $350,000, and you owe $250,000 on your mortgage. That means you have $100,000 in home equity ($350,000 \\\\u2013 $250,000). A lender may approve you for a HELOC of up to $85,000, which is 85% of your equity. How to Pay Back a HELOC Paying back the money you borrow from a HELOC is different from an installment loan. With home equity loans, you receive lump sum payments for the full amount and then repay the money over time with fixed monthly payments, in which you\\\\u2019ll pay interest and the principal. With a home equity credit line, however, you can borrow money as often as you like, as long as you don\\\\u2019t go over the credit limit. You can then repay the borrowed money periodically to replenish your available credit. You also have the option with a HELOC of paying interest on the money you borrow and deferring the principal payment until the end of the draw period. Depending on your lender, you may be required to make a balloon payment on the balance, or you may be able to refinance it into a traditional loan. Using a HELOC to Purchase Real Estate Using a HELOC to buy real estate is a strategy many real estate investors use to quickly grow their portfolios. If you already own a property, you can use the equity to obtain a HELOC. You then borrow money from it to use as a down payment on another home. If you have equity of $100,000 in a property, for example, you may be able to obtain a HELOC for up to $85,000. You can then withdraw up to $85,000 to use as a down payment on the purchase of another property. It\\\\u2019s important to keep in mind that if you do use a HELOC to buy real estate, you will have two loans to repay: the line of credit and the mortgage.\\\\u00a0 Be sure to carefully evaluate any investment you are considering to make sure you will earn enough from it to repay the money you borrow. Pros and Cons of HELOCs Because they can be used for nearly anything, HELOCs are popular borrowing options. Before you apply for a home equity line of credit, however, consider both their pros and cons to make sure it\\\\u2019s the best loan option for your needs. Pros If you want to convert your home\\\\u2019s equity into money for a remodeling project or something else, there are several HELOC advantages to consider.\\\\u00a0 The pros may include: \\\\nLow-cost alternative to credit cards or personal loans\\\\nThe money you borrow can be used for nearly anything\\\\nFlexible repayment terms\\\\nRevolving, meaning the money can be reborrowed once repaid\\\\nTax-deductible under certain circumstances\\\\n Cons A home equity line of credit may not be the best borrowing option for every situation.\\\\u00a0 HELOC disadvantages may include: \\\\nYour home serves as collateral and can be foreclosed on if you default\\\\nClosing costs may be 2% to 5% of the credit limit\\\\nAdjustable interest rates will fluctuate over time\\\\n Alternatives to a Home Equity Line of Credit A homeowner may use a home equity line of credit or a cash-out refinance instead of a HELOC. Personal loans and credit cards are also options to consider. Although they are convenient, you may pay a much higher interest rate with a credit card than with other borrowing options. HELOC vs. home equity loan HELOCs and home equity loans both use a property\\\\u2019s equity as collateral and have closing costs. A HELOC, however, is a revolving line of credit, while a home equity loan is an installment loan where you make fixed monthly payments on the money you borrow. Home equity loans and HELOCs both allow you to tap into the equity in your home, but how you repay the money you borrow is different. A HELOC lets you borrow, repay, and borrow again, while a home equity loan is a lump-sum loan.\\\\u00a0 In addition, the interest rate charged on HELOC funds is typically variable, while a home equity loan has a fixed interest rate. HELOC vs. cash-out refinance The loan option you choose will determine how you pay interest on the money you borrow. With a HELOC, you obtain a line of credit that uses a home\\\\u2019s equity that you can draw from as needed.\\\\u00a0 With a cash-out refinance, however, you obtain a new mortgage for your home. The new mortgage will be for a higher amount than what you owe on your home. The extra cash you borrow can be used for whatever you like. A cash-out refinance may be preferable when there are rising interest rates. Because HELOCs have variable interest rates, you can\\\\u2019t predict how much you will pay for the money you borrow. With a cash-out refinance, however, you can lock in the interest rate when the loan is created, which helps with budgeting. Should You Use a HELOC? HELOCs are best suited for when you need to periodically borrow money, like when you are rehabbing a home. With a rehab project, you may need to borrow money to buy new flooring, for example. When you are ready for the next phase of the rehab, you can then borrow more. A HELOC may also be a great borrowing option for real estate investors because it allows you to make interest-only payments during the draw period.\\\\u00a0 If you are using the fix-and-flip strategy, for example, you can borrow the money you need to rehab a home, make interest-only payments, and then repay the borrowed money after you sell it. A home equity loan may be a better borrowing option when rising interest rates are a concern. It allows you to lock in the interest rate when the loan is created and make fixed monthly payments over a fixed term. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) FAQs Although HELOCs are good borrowing options for many purposes, they may not be ideal for everything. Here are some frequently asked questions to help you decide whether a HELOC is the best loan for your needs. How much equity do you need for a HELOC? The amount of equity you will need for a HELOC will vary depending on the lender. Most lenders require that you have at least 15% to 20% equity in a home before they will approve you for a HELOC. How long does it take to get a HELOC? How long it takes to get a HELOC is another factor that varies depending on the lender. It may take anywhere from two weeks to two months from the time you submit a HELOC application to the closing. During this time, your financial information will be verified and evaluated, and your home will be appraised. Is HELOC interest tax deductible? Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, interest paid on a HELOC is tax deductible under certain conditions. The money you borrow must be used for home improvements on the property used as collateral. Interest charged on money you borrow for other things, like college tuition, debt consolidation, or a vacation, isn\\\\u2019t tax deductible. Can you refinance a HELOC? Some HELOCs require balloon payments at the end of the draw period and don\\\\u2019t automatically convert into repayment periods. If you have a HELOC that requires a balloon payment, you may be able to refinance it into a conventional loan to take advantage of a fixed interest rate and a fixed repayment term.

The name \"529\" comes from the section of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that created these plans.\\n\\n529 plans are sponsored by states, state agencies, or educational institutions and are usually managed by investment companies. They allow you to save money on a tax-free basis and withdraw the funds tax-free when used for eligible education expenses.\\n\\nHere are some key features of 529 plans:\\n\\n1. Tax benefits: Contributions to a 529 plan are not subject to federal income tax, and earnings on the investments grow tax-free. Withdrawals are tax-free if used for eligible education expenses.\\n2. High contribution limits: The annual contribution limit to a 529 plan is generally higher than the annual limits for other types of investment accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s.\\n3. Flexibility: You can use a 529 plan to save for education expenses for yourself, your spouse, or your dependents. You can also change the beneficiary of the account if needed.\\n4. Professional management: 529 plans are managed by professional investment managers, which means you don\\'t have to actively manage the investments yourself.\\n5. Variety of investment options: 529 plans typically offer a range of investment options, such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and index funds, which can be tailored to your investment risk tolerance and time horizon.\\n6. Financial aid impact: Contributions to a 529 plan are considered assets of the account owner and may impact financial aid eligibility for beneficiaries. However, the impact is generally limited to a maximum of 5.64% of the account balance.\\n7. Withdrawal rules: Withdrawals from a 529 plan are tax-free and penalty-free if used for eligible education expenses, such as tuition, fees, and room and board at accredited colleges, universities, and vocational schools.\\n8.

              "\"\\n\\nAccording to the most recent data available, there is a total of $1.7 trillion in outstanding student loans in the United States. This number represents the amount of money that students and former students owe to banks, the government, and other lenders. The majority of these loans are federal student loans, which are issued by the U.S. Department of Education.\\n\\nThe status of student loans in the United States is a complex issue, with many borrowers struggling to repay their loans. Here are some key statistics and trends related to student loans in the U.S.:\\n\\n1. Delinquency and default rates: According to the Federal Reserve, the delinquency rate for student loans (defined as loans that are 90 days or more past due) was 11.1% in 2020. The default rate (defined as loans that are at least 270 days past due or in the process of being collected) was 8.7%. These rates have remained relatively stable in recent years, but they are still concerning, as they indicate that many borrowers are having trouble repaying their loans.\\n2. Student loan debt as a percentage of GDP: The total amount of outstanding student loans in the U.S. is currently around 10% of the country's GDP. This is a significant increase from just a few decades ago, when student loan debt was much lower as a percentage of GDP.\\n3. Income-driven repayment plans: Income-driven repayment plans are designed to help borrowers who are struggling to repay their loans based on their income. These plans can lower the monthly payment amount for borrowers who have a low income, and they can also provide forgiveness of the remaining balance after a certain number of years. According to the U.S. Department of Education, around 40% of federal student loan borrowers are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan.\\n4. Student loan forgiveness programs: There are several student loan forgiveness programs available in the U.S., including Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Teacher Loan Forgiveness. These programs can provide forgiveness of a portion of the loan balance for borrowers who work in certain fields, such as public service\""
