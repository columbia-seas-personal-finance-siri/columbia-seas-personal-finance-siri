{"Article Title":"Best Stocks to Buy In 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/top-stocks-to-buy\/","Article Content":"There are literally thousands of publicly traded companies you can invest in, not to mention the many exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds you can buy. So, it's not surprising that many investors don't know where to begin. And although the market is well above its recent bear market lows, plenty of stocks are trading for significantly less than they were a year or two ago.\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n\n\nBut what are the best stocks to buy in 2023? Although I don't have a crystal ball that tells me what stocks will deliver the best returns, I've tried to do the next best thing. In this article, I'll discuss 10 stocks that I think could be great buys in 2023 for long-term investors looking to put their money to work.\n\n\nWhy these 10?Why these 10?Before we get to the stocks, let's acknowledge three caveats:Choosing the best stocks to buy today depends on your personal financial situation. To get a feel for where you stand, read our guide on how to invest in stocks. It walks you through topics such as establishing an emergency fund, allocating assets, and choosing the right stocks for you.I like these stocks as long-term investments, even in a bear market. I have absolutely no idea what they'll do over the next few weeks or months. In fact, if inflation stays elevated longer than expected, interest rates climb higher than investors believe they will, or the U.S. falls into a deep recession, it's entirely possible that most or all of these could decline in the near term.Although I ensured some variety, the list below isn't meant to be a fully diversified portfolio. Instead, they're my highest-conviction long-term stocks to invest in for 2023 and beyond. The best one-step way to diversify your holdings is to build the core of your portfolio around something like the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (VT  -0.28%).Now let's get to my list of the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for the long term -- from smallest market cap to largest -- followed by the summarized buy thesis for each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublicly Traded Company\n\n\nA company that issues shares that are publicly traded, meaning the shares are available for anyone to buy and sell on the stock market.\n\n\n\n\nThe top 10 stocksThe top 10 stocks to buy in September 2023Etsy (ETSY  1.3%), $8 billionPinterest (PINS  2.04%), $18 billionRealty Income (O  1.17%), $38 billionMercadoLibre (MELI  -0.49%), $67 billionPayPal (PYPL  0.48%), $68 billionShopify (SHOP  2.58%), $75 billionIntuitive Surgical (ISRG  -1.3%), $105 billionWalt Disney (DIS  1.15%), $150 billionBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A  -1.78%)(BRK.B  -1.89%), $815 billionAmazon (AMZN  0.91%), $1.42 trillion\n\n\n\n\n\nElevator pitches for each stockNow that you've seen my top 10 best stocks to buy now, you may be wondering why I picked each company. Here's a quick rundown of why I'm such a fan of each as a long-term stock to invest in.1 - 31. Etsy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, Etsy was growing nicely by connecting craft makers with customers looking for something a bit more out of the ordinary than mainstream e-commerce fare. During the pandemic, e-commerce got a huge boost. But Etsy absolutely skyrocketed, growing at more than twice the rate of overall e-commerce.As the pandemic and its accompanying e-commerce surge have cooled off, so has Etsy's momentum. However, its growth has been strong across all product categories and continues to be impressive despite the tough economic climate. In fact, in the second quarter of 2023, Etsy's marketplace sales volume was up 175% over comparable pre-pandemic (2019) levels.As you may notice throughout this list, powerful platforms get my attention. Make no mistake: Etsy is one of them. Few e-commerce companies go head-to-head with Amazon and survive. Etsy not only survived when Amazon rolled out its own handmade items platform -- it won. But this could still be the early days of an excellent long-term growth story.Because of its platform and brand strength, Etsy's market opportunity is in the hundreds of billions -- if not trillions -- of dollars. With about $13 billion in sales on its platform in 2022, it has just started to scratch the surface. And with the stock falling significantly in the recent growth stock downturn, now could be a great time for patient long-term investors to take a closer look.2. Pinterest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest is an oasis of positivity in a social media landscape that's grown increasingly depressing and divisive. That partially flows from what Pinterest is about -- ideas.People go to Pinterest to focus on things, not on other people. Whether building a dream deck, baking a kid's birthday cake, or updating your wardrobe, Pinterest gives people visual inspiration for the things they want to get done.Recent results show that Pinterest's growth has resumed, with the user base growing by 8% year over year to 465 million in the second quarter of 2023. There's still lots of long-term user growth potential, and management recently said that growth is re-accelerating.The most exciting thing from a long-term investor's perspective is that Pinterest has a massive opportunity when it comes to the monetization of its users. This is especially true internationally, where the bulk of Pinterest users are located but where the least monetization has occurred.There's also a big monetization opportunity as the company pivots away from its traditional ad-focused model and tries to find ways to incorporate e-commerce into its platform. And the pivot certainly makes sense.Pinterest is a place where people go to find things they might want to buy, and it hired e-commerce veteran Bill Ready as its CEO in 2022 to accelerate its pivot. It could take a while for the company to truly realize its e-commerce potential, but it is making impressive progress, and long-term investors could be handsomely rewarded.\n\n\n3. Realty Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to value, growth, and income, it's tough to find a more well-rounded stock for long-term investors than Realty Income.If you aren't familiar with it, Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and primarily invests in freestanding, single-tenant retail properties. Walgreens (WBA  6.41%), Dollar General (DG  0.41%), and FedEx (FDX  -0.57%) are just a few examples of its top tenants.Realty Income owns about 13,100 properties in the U.S. and Europe, most of which are rather recession-resistant and less vulnerable to e-commerce disruption than many other retail businesses. Plus, the company's triple-net lease structure helps create a steady, predictable income stream.The proof is in the performance. Since its 1994 listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Realty Income has produced 14.2% annualized total returns, handily outperforming the S&P 500. It has paid 639 consecutive monthly dividends, and as of September 2023, its yield is about 5.7%. The company has increased its payout for more than 100 consecutive quarters, and there's no reason to think this pattern will end anytime soon.\n\n\n4 - 64. MercadoLibre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of my favorite long-term stock investments in the market, MercadoLibre is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, and for good reason. The company operates an e-commerce marketplace with a dominant presence in some of the region's most populous nations, including Brazil and Argentina.However, there's a lot more to MercadoLibre. It operates a fast-growing payments platform called Mercado Pago, a logistics service known as Mercado Envios, a business lending platform, and more.The marketplace saw $10.5 billion in merchandise volume in the second quarter of 2023, 47% higher than the same quarter in 2022. Mercado Pago processes almost $170 billion in annualized volume, with almost three-fourths coming from outside the company's e-commerce platform.Both main parts of the business are growing rapidly. And don't overlook Mercado Credito, the company's young but fast-growing (and highly profitable) lending business. Mercado Credito has $3.3 billion of outstanding loan balances and has grown rapidly so far.The best part is that all these businesses are in the relatively early stages. MercadoLibre's merchandise volume is roughly 8% of Amazon's, and its Mercado Pago payment volume is about 12% of the amount that PayPal (PYPL  0.48%) processes. So, there's a ton of runway ahead.MercadoLibre isn't just the Amazon of Latin America -- it's the Amazon, PayPal, Square, Shopify, and more, all rolled into one. And it's in a much earlier stage of growth. As the e-commerce and fintech landscapes in Latin America evolve over the coming years, MercadoLibre could be a major long-term beneficiary.5. PayPal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayPal is an absolute cash machine that has been beaten down by about 75% from its highs.The main reason is that investors were disappointed when PayPal's growth abruptly slowed down in 2022, and management conceded that its previous user growth targets were unrealistic. Plus, with fears of a recession, we could certainly see lower consumer spending in the near term -- which would mean lower fee income for PayPal.However, it's important for investors to realize that this is still a strong and highly profitable business. The company has about 430 million active users between PayPal and Venmo and processes about $1.3 trillion in annualized payment volume. The company expects about $5 billion in free cash flow for 2023 and has been aggressively buying back its own stock.It's not hard to see why PayPal's management is choosing to use its capital this way. The stock is trading at its lowest price-to-sales ratio ever and trades for just 12 times forward earnings.6. Shopify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopify operates a platform designed to allow businesses of all sizes to sell their products online, with a particular focus on empowering smaller businesses and growing with them by establishing long-term relationships.Shopify offers a subscription plan starting at $39 per month for businesses and many adjacent services that help businesses operate smoothly, such as payment processing solutions and logistics.Shopify's \"one-stop shop\" approach to enabling e-commerce has turned it into a powerhouse. It now has more e-commerce sales flowing through its ecosystem than any other company besides Amazon. However, Shopify could be just getting started.The platform has generated $6.3 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. However, this is just a fraction of its estimated $153 billion (and growing) market opportunity as more retailers shift their focus to online sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nRevenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered.\n\n\n\n\nE-commerce is still in the relatively early stages, making up slightly more than 15% of retail sales in the United States. Shopify has the No. 2 share, giving it a powerful ecosystem with network effect advantages over competitors.The stock's price is still well below the highs in the recent market downturn due to recession fears and signs of a slowdown in consumer spending, and Shopify looks like a great long-term opportunity.\n\n\n7 - 107. Intuitive Surgical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobot-assisted surgery beats shaky human hands. That general thesis hasn't changed much from when I first noticed Intuitive Surgical stock in 2005. The da Vinci surgical system is the clear market leader, and the \"razors and blades\" model helps it generate a recurring stream of revenue as its systems are used to perform procedures.Intuitive Surgical is dominant in its space, with a market share of about 80% worldwide. And it has lots of room to grow as the adoption of its surgical systems and the number of supported procedures increase over time. This is particularly true in many international markets, where the implementation of robot-assisted surgery could be a long-tailed growth catalyst for this excellent business for decades to come.8. Disney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House of Mouse is like the all-weather tires of a portfolio. The pandemic hurt its theme park and movie businesses but helped the Disney+ streaming service, which has grown into a powerhouse years earlier than Disney expected.In fact, Disney+ now has about 146 million subscribers fewer than four years after launching, while the company's initial five-year goal called for 60 million to 90 million. To be sure, Disney is still trying to figure out the best ways to make Disney+ a profitable business, but it's clearly progressing in the right direction. The market is absorbing price increases with little impact on the subscriber count.In 2023, demand for Disney's theme parks, movies, and cruise line has been very strong despite inflation pressures and recession fears. In fact, revenue is far greater than in comparable pre-pandemic times in Disney's parks due to initiatives that have driven higher per-guest spending. Plus, the company recently announced it will invest $60 billion over the next 10 years in its theme parks and cruise lines to make sure they stay full for the foreseeable future.With Disney also laser-focused on the profitability of Disney+ and its other streaming platforms, Hulu and ESPN+, this could be a powerful combination of profitable all-weather revenue streams. In a nutshell, Disney might be the ultimate combination of an in-person experiential play and a tech-focused growth business.Its amazing stable of intellectual property (Marvel Cinematic Universe\/Star Wars\/ESPN\/Pixar\/Disney) and cash-machine theme park business gives it a margin of safety that makes it perhaps the safest stock on this list. And it still has tremendous profit growth potential as the newer areas of its business evolve.9. Berkshire Hathaway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough most of this list is made up of growth stocks, or at least stocks that have some exciting growth drivers, this is the relatively boring value pick of the bunch (but in the best possible way).Berkshire Hathaway owns a collection of about 60 subsidiary businesses, including household names such as GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, just to name a few. Berkshire also owns a portfolio of common stocks worth about $355 billion that includes massive stakes in Apple (AAPL  0.3%), Bank of America (BAC  -0.65%), Chevron (CVX  -1.16%), American Express (AXP  -0.69%), and Coca-Cola (KO  0.3%), as well as positions in dozens of other companies.Most of the larger positions were personally handpicked by legendary investor Warren Buffett, who still manages the bulk of Berkshire's investments. In fact, If Berkshire were a mutual fund, it would be the world's largest actively managed mutual fund.The Buffett bears will say he has lost his fastball, but Berkshire continues to produce market-beating returns in most years despite its massive size. And while Berkshire certainly won't produce the 3,787,464% return (not a typo) it has produced from the time Buffett took the helm through the end of 2022, there's no reason to believe it won't continue to outpace the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future.Buffett won't be in charge forever. But Berkshire is his legacy, and he's been stress-proofing it for years to ensure it's in solid shape long after he's no longer running things. Showing his faith, he and longtime business partner Charlie Munger have been buying back shares regularly. That's a good sign for patient long-term investors like us.10. Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon doesn't really need much of an elevator pitch for most people. The company has a dominant lead in the U.S. e-commerce market. And its Amazon Web Services cloud platform is also a market leader, with a significant lead over the other two large players in the space, Microsoft (MSFT  0.67%) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -1.1%)(GOOG  -0.96%).However, more growth potential exists than you might think. We're a long way from maximizing e-commerce adoption; it still accounts for a little more than 15% of all U.S. retail sales. The cloud industry is relatively young and expected to roughly quadruple in size to a $2.3 trillion market by 2032. Amazon also has a ton of potential in other areas, such as healthcare, grocery stores, neighborhood markets, and more.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Invest In: Use Your Money to Make Money\n\nSo where should you invest?

Artificial intelligence (AI), including its offshoots of deep learning and machine learning, uses computers to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is the use of machines to mimic human intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do companies use AI?How do companies use artificial intelligence?AI is created through machine learning, which involves training a system with huge amounts of data. It then uses the trained system to make inferences about new data it\u2019s never seen.\n\n\nThe simplest example is a system designed to detect objects in images. Images with those objects are provided to the system, which \u201clearns\u201d how to detect those objects in other images. The more objects in images it detects, the more accurate the detection system becomes.Companies employ artificial intelligence in two main ways. Many tech companies use AI to make their existing operations more powerful such as through high-profile applications, including robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL  -1.1%), (GOOG  -0.96%), uses AI to filter out spam for Gmail users. Amazon (AMZN  0.91%) uses AI to recommend products to customers, while Netflix (NFLX  0.33%) uses AI to guide content creation and recommendations.More recently, OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown how far \"generative AI\" a division of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating texts, images, sounds, and ideas, has come. The potential of such large language models is enormous.Some companies also profit directly from AI by selling hardware, software, services, or expertise that the technology needs. These are true artificial intelligence stocks and include those listed and described below.\n\n\nTop AI stocks to buy in 2023Top AI stocks to buy in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\nAI Focus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n\nGraphics chips and self-driving cars\n\n\n\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM)\n\n\nAugmenting human intelligence across industries\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\n\nMemory chips for data centers and self-driving cars\n\n\n\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\n\nVoice-activated technology, cloud computing, and e-commerce\n\n\n\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI)\n\n\nUses software-as-a-service to provide enterprise-scale AI applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Nvidia1. Nvidia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading graphics chip company Nvidia has taken advantage of the AI boom, with its graphics cards becoming the de facto standard in data centers around the world. Machine learning\u2019s training phase demands a lot of computing power; the phase that follows, the inference phase, requires less. Graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, used primarily for rendering video games, support both phases well.Nvidia\u2019s data center business represents a steadily increasing share of the company\u2019s total revenue and topped its gaming segment in revenue in fiscal 2022. This segment isn\u2019t all AI-related -- Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards are used to accelerate a wide variety of data center applications. But AI is one of the driving forces behind the company\u2019s growth.Its chips are popular for demanding workloads that applications like large language models require, and the company just launched a new set of inference platforms specifically designed for generative AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerative AI\n\n\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) where computer systems create new content.\n\n\n\n\nSelf-driving cars are another area of focus. Nvidia develops platforms, including hardware and software, that can power driver-assistance features, as well as fully autonomous driving.A self-driving car must process massive amounts of data from multiple sensors and cameras in real time, detect objects such as pedestrians and other vehicles, and make complex decisions. They require a tremendous amount of computing power, and that\u2019s exactly what Nvidia\u2019s platform delivers.Its professional visualization segment, which includes its omniverse, also has a lot of potential in AI.Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards could someday be supplanted by more specialized processors designed for AI, but for now, the company is in an enviable position.\n\n\n2. IBM2. IBM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis legacy tech company is an integrated provider of hardware, software, and services to large enterprise customers. Its mainframe computer systems are still ubiquitous in certain industries, and it regularly signs multi-year technology deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars each.IBM\u2019s strategy with AI is to apply the technology in ways that augment human intelligence, increase efficiency, or lower costs. In the healthcare industry, IBM\u2019s AI technology is being used to create individualized care plans, accelerate the process of bringing new drugs to market, and improve the quality of care, though it sold off its Watson Health business in early 2022. In the financial services industry, via the company\u2019s 2016 acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, IBM is using AI to help clients with the daunting task of financial regulatory compliance.While the market for AI products and services is fragmented, IBM is leading the industry. Market research firm IDC ranked IBM as the leader in AI software platforms with a 13.7% market share in 2020, up 46% from the prior year.IBM is a complicated company undergoing transformation, and AI is far from its only growth opportunity. But if you\u2019re looking to invest in a company that is well-positioned to benefit from the AI boom, IBM is a good choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Microsoft3. Microsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has gotten a lot of buzz of late thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft began investing in the tech start-up in 2019, and recently put another $10 billion in OpenAI following the launch of ChatGPT.Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine, powered by ChatGPT, and the company is racing to incorporate GPT features across its product portfolio, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service, Edge web browser, Office productivity software suite, and Bing.CEO Satya Nadella has said repeatedly that he sees AI as the next major computing platform, and the $10 billion investment in OpenAI is a sign of its conviction in AI and its belief that it needs to lead that transition in order or get left behind as it did with mobile.Microsoft is also harnessing the power of AI in other ways, including automated clinical documentation in healthcare to reduce paperwork and administrative needs, and using Azure to allow customers to build custom AI tools.4. Amazon4. Amazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps no company is using AI more widely than Amazon. Founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos has been an evangelist for AI and machine learning. Although Amazon started as an online retailer, technology has always been at the company\u2019s core.Today, Amazon uses artificial intelligence for everything from Alexa, its industry-leading voice-activated technology, to its Amazon Go cashierless grocery stores, to Amazon Web Services Sagemaker, the cloud infrastructure tool that deploys high-quality machine learning models for data scientists and developers.Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business is also built on AI since algorithms run its top-flight recommendation engines for e-commerce and video and music streaming. In addition, Amazon uses AI to determine product rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Bedrock\n\n\nAmazon Bedrock is a service for building generative AI applications on Amazon\u2019s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services.\n\n\n\n\nEven Amazon\u2019s logistics operations benefit from its AI prowess, which helps with scheduling, rerouting, and other ways to improve delivery accuracy and efficiency. Drone delivery, which the company has long sought to implement, would be yet another AI application for the tech giant.It\u2019s difficult to quantify the impact of AI on Amazon\u2019s business, but it\u2019s clearly a key component of the company\u2019s competitive advantage. Throughout its history, Amazon has been at the forefront of emerging technologies such as e-commerce, e-books, cloud computing, video streaming, and voice-activated technology. AI provides much of the infrastructure that helps the company move into new businesses quickly and effectively.5. C3.ai5. C3.ai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC3.ai may be the closest thing on the stock market to a pure-play AI stock, as the \u201cai\u201d in the company\u2019s name and its ticker might indicate. While the companies on the list above are diversified tech giants or chip makers that have some businesses involved with AI, artificial intelligence is the entire focus of C3.ai.C3.ai is a SaaS company whose software allows companies to deploy large AI applications. The company\u2019s tools help its customers accelerate software development and reduce cost and risk, and they have a wide variety of applications. For example, the U.S. Air Force uses C3 AI Readiness to predict aircraft systems failures, identify spare parts, and find new ways to increase mission capability. European utility company Engie (ENGIY  0.99%) is using C3 AI to analyze energy consumption and reduce energy expenditures.It's also launching its own generative AI suite with enterprise search as the first product. Enterprise search allows customers to use a natural language interface to locate and retrieve relevant data across all of the enterprise's information systems.C3.ai is the first mover in its industry and says it isn\u2019t aware of an end-to-end enterprise AI development platform in direct competition with it. That unique positioning could make the company a big winner over the long term, although the AI SaaS market is evolving and could attract competition from big cloud infrastructure such as Amazon or Microsoft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\nMachine learning is a technique by which artificial intelligence programs are trained.\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning stocksMachine learning stocksAll of the stocks above use machine learning technologies, but if you\u2019re looking for more options, here are two others worth considering:Alteryx (AYX  1.59%) is a provider of data analytics software that empowers data workers to solve problems with a wide range of analytics and data science tools. Its Alteryx Intelligence Suite, one of several products, offers machine learning capabilities, including automated modeling and natural language processing to build models.DocuSign (DOCU  -0.02%), an AI-powered leader in digital signature software, has made significant inroads into machine learning in recent years. In 2020, the company acquired Seal Software, an enterprise contract analytics company that uses machine learning for organizing and identifying risks and opportunities in contracts. For years, DocuSign has been building machine learning tools such as DocuSign Insight to help with contract analysis through natural language processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Learning\n\n\nDeep learning, an advanced branch of AI, finds patterns in data, aiding predictions.\n\n\n\n\nDeep learning stocksDeep learning stocksDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain. It\u2019s the most advanced kind of artificial intelligence and is crucial in technologies such as self-driving cars. Deep learning is making advances in areas such as preventive healthcare, where predictive algorithms are necessary, and it differs from machine learning in that it doesn\u2019t require human inputs.Among the companies closely associated with deep learning are Nvidia, whose GPU chips use deep learning to power data centers and enable autonomous driving and cloud computing, among other functions.Alphabet has exposure to deep learning through a number of its businesses, including its autonomous vehicle start-up Waymo. It also owns DeepMind, a deep learning platform that can diagnose eye diseases, predict the shapes of proteins, and accelerate the scientific discovery process.\n\n\nAI is a growth businessAI is a growth businessTotal spending on AI systems is forecast to reach $97.9 billion in 2023, up from $37.5 billion in 2019.

{"Article Title":"How to Invest in OpenAI & ChatGPT","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/stock-market\/market-sectors\/information-technology\/ai-stocks\/chatgpt\/","Article Content":"In just a few months, ChatGPT, the disruptive AI chatbot made by OpenAI, has taken the world by storm.The technology has wowed everyone from CEOs to technologists to ordinary users, performing a range of activities like writing poetry and code or explaining complex subjects in neatly packaged paragraphs. It's also passed high-level exams for law school, medical licensing, and MBA programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is the use of machines to mimic human intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty images\n\n\n\nUsing a simple chat interface, ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, is able to answer questions directly and is as easy to use as Google Search. The free AI chat interface signed up 100 million users in just two months after its launch on Nov. 30, 2022, and has the potential to disrupt industries from internet search to content creation.In this article, we'll discuss the implications for ChatGPT and robot chat more generally, how you can get exposure to it as an investor, and whether you should invest in ChatGPT.\n\n\nHow to invest in ChatGPTHow to invest in ChatGPT\n\n\nChatGPT isn't publicly traded, and OpenAI, the company that built it, isn't either. However, there are a number of ways to get exposure to ChatGPT.The most direct one is through Microsoft (MSFT  0.67%). Microsoft has had a strategic partnership with OpenAI since 2019, and has invested billions of dollars into the AI start-up over its history. After ChatGPT was unveiled in early 2023, Microsoft invested $10 billion into OpenAI, showing both the company's confidence in OpenAI's potential and its belief that artificial intelligence is the next major computing platform.Another way to get exposure to ChatGPT is through NVIDIA (NVDA  0.95%). NVIDIA is one of the world's most valuable semiconductor companies, and the leading producer of graphics processing units. Its GPUs are often used for artificial intelligence purposes, training large language models like ChatGPT and processing large amounts of data. They are a key component in many machine learning models.\n\n\nFinally, Perion Network (PERI  -0.13%) is another potential winner from the ChatGPT rollout. Perion is a small-cap ad tech stock, but it has a strategic partnership with Microsoft's Bing search engine, and Microsoft is rolling out a new version of Bing, powered by ChatGPT. If Bing gains market share on Google with the help of ChatGPT, Perion is likely to be a big winner.\n\n\n\nData source: Company websites and YCharts. Market cap data as of Sept. 18, 2023.\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nTicker\n\n\nMarket Cap\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\n\n\n(NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\n\n$2.44 trillion\n\n\nDiversified global tech giant\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA\n\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n\n$1.09 trillion\n\n\nLeading maker of a graphics chips\n\n\n\n\nPerion Network\n\n\n(NASDAQ:PERI)\n\n\n$1.53 billion\n\n\nA small-cap ad tech company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Microsoft1. Microsoft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is best known as a diversified global tech giant. It makes money from everything from its Windows operating systems, to its Azure cloud infrastructure service, to subscription software products like its Office software suite, as well as hardware like Surface, gaming products under Xbox, and the LinkedIn professional social network.However, more recently, Microsoft has been getting attention for its strategic partnership with OpenAI. The company has bet big on OpenAI and ChatGPT. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has called AI the next major computing platform, and has already leveraged the power of ChatGPT and OpenAI's tools in a number of products, including Azure.Microsoft's biggest bet with ChatGPT is on Bing, and Nadella has said that a new search engine race is happening. He's also eager to take the fight to Alphabet's Google (GOOGL  -1.1%)(GOOG  -0.96%). Nadella views the landscape in search as asymmetric, with Alphabet unable to afford losing market share in search, and any gain being a win for Bing.If you're looking for the company that's most closely connected with OpenAI and ChatGPT, Microsoft is your best choice. However, the company is so big that only a small amount of the business is exposed to ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. NVIDIA2. NVIDIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVIDIA stock has taken off over the last decade as its graphics processing chips have become a vital part of everything from gaming to self-driving cars to artificial intelligence.AI comes with extraordinary computing demands, and NVIDIA's chips are able to handle the workload better than its competitors.For example, UBS (UBS  -0.2%) estimates that 10,000 NVIDIA graphics processing units were used to train ChatGPT, and some analysts estimate that 30,000 of its GPUs are now being used to run OpenAI's chatbot.NVIDIA has also teamed up with Microsoft to build a massive cloud AI computer using tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs and other NVIDIA AI software tools.Given NVIDIA's strength in AI computing power, including products like the Omniverse, NVIDIA looks like a good AI stock to own if you're looking for an investment poised to make gains from the growth in artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Perion Network3. Perion Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to get exposure to ChatGPT is through Perion Network (PERI  -0.13%), a small-cap ad tech firm. Perion is best known for its intelligent hub, which connects advertisers and publishers to optimize ad placement and inventory for both parties.However, the company also brings in almost half of its revenue through search, largely through its partnership with Bing. Perion is one of the ad tech companies the Microsoft search engine uses to help to optimize ads and conversions. Perion gets revenue share through Bing when a user click on an ad leads to a sale.In its recent earnings presentation, Perion shared a quote from Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, who said that each additional percentage of market share that Bing gets translates to almost $2 billion in annual revenue, meaning that it wouldn't take much to move the needle for Perion.Considering the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17, the stock could soar if the new Bing begins to gain traction.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Quantum Computing Stocks\n\nAn in-depth look at the best quantum computing stocks in the U.S stock market this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Cloud Computing Stocks\n\nMoving operations to the cloud is the way of the future for many companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in a Quantum Computing ETF\n\nQuantum computing is becoming increasingly affordable and effective to the point that there's now a quantum computing ETF.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now\n\nChips are the building blocks of the technology we use every day.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you invest in ChatGPT?Should you invest in ChatGPT?ChatGPT and generative AI have the potential to change everything from the way we work to the way we learn and are entertained.It's still very early for ChatGPT and the next iteration of AI, and some are even asking if ChatGPT is safe to use since the product is new and has only just started to be monetized. Additionally, the hype around AI stocks has surged in recent months, leading shares of AI stocks like C3.ai (AI  1.43%) and anything else connected to artificial intelligence to soar.However, for risk-seeking investors, it's not a bad idea to invest some of these ChatGPT stocks. Microsoft seems like the most stable bet of the bunch; the company has a wide range of products to make use of the AI chatbot and its partnership with OpenAI will help it benefit from future advances in generative AI technology.NVIDIA should also be a winner since it's likely to benefit from increased demand for computing power, and Perion Network stock has a lot of upside potential if the new Bing begins to catch on.Although the tech stock crash in 2022 may have chastened tech investors, ChatGPT has crystallized the potential of AI and is likely to kick off a new race in artificial intelligence.To hedge your bets, investing in all three of these stocks and holding them for the long term may be the best way to get exposure to ChatGPT. You can also invest in an AI ETF for broad exposure to the sector.Any new technology comes with risk for investors, but the upside potential from the new generative AI technology could be enormous.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

{"Article Title":"6 Steps to Learn How to Buy Stocks","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/how-to-invest\/stocks\/how-to-buy-stock\/","Article Content":"So you've decided to invest in the stock market, and you even have some ideas about which stocks you want to buy. But how do you actually purchase those shares?\n\n\n\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\n\n\nHow do you actually buy shares of stock?How do you actually buy shares of stock?\u00a0Fortunately, the process of buying your first shares of stock online is relatively quick and easy. Here's a step-by-step guide to start your stock investing journey.1. Open a brokerage account1. Open a brokerage accountFirst, you'll need a brokerage account to buy stock. Consider two main factors when selecting an online stock brokerage:What the brokerage offers: Does the brokerage firm offer every product and service you need? Some brokerages publish excellent educational resources for new investors. Others provide access to stock research and analytical tools. Some online brokerages maintain branches where you can receive guidance in person. Perhaps other features, such as the ability to trade international stocks or buy fractional shares, are important to you.The user-friendliness of the brokerage platform: Is the brokerage's platform easy to navigate? If you want to trade using your mobile device, then the brokerage's mobile interface needs to be easy to use. Many of the largest brokerages allow you to use play money to experience their trading platforms before you invest, so try a few to decide which platform you like the most.Most major online brokerages, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW  0.64%), Fidelity, and others, have eliminated trading commissions. For most investors, this largely takes cost out of the equation when choosing a brokerage platform.Once you've chosen a brokerage, you'll need to complete a new account application. This is typically quick and easy, but you'll need to have photo identification handy, such as a driver's license and your Social Security number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Security Number (SSN)\n\n\nA nine-digit identification number issued to United States citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents originally meant to be used exclusively to track earnings and benefits.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need your bank account information if you want to fund your new brokerage account using your checking or savings account. You can choose to open a standard brokerage account. Or, you can choose to establish an individual retirement account (IRA), which comes with some pretty nice tax advantages.Another decision you may face is whether to establish margin privilege for your new brokerage account. Having margin privilege enables you to buy stocks with money borrowed from your brokerage.To be clear, investing on margin is generally not a good idea for most investors. However, establishing margin privilege can confer some other benefits. For example, you may begin trading in your brokerage account before your deposited funds have cleared if you have margin privileges.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Decide which stocks to buy2. Decide which stocks you want to buyIn this article, we won't go to deep into the many possible methods of analyzing and selecting individual stocks to buy. However, the next step is to determine which stocks you'd like to purchase.A couple of pointers:Follow a \"buy and hold\" strategy: Only buy stocks that you want to own for many years. Don't buy a stock just because you think it will perform well over the next few weeks or months.Diversify your holdings: Don't put all of your money into just one or two stocks. Even if you're investing only a relatively small amount of money to start, diversify your portfolio by buying a few shares of several different stocks. With the advent of commission-free trading, owning the stocks of many different companies does not incur any additional expense.Learn more about how to choose which stocks to buy by checking out our comprehensive guide to investing in the stock market.\n\n\n3. Decide how much to buy3. Decide how many shares to buyTo determine how many shares you should buy, first decide how much money you want to invest in each stock that interests you and then divide this amount by the stock's current share price. You can find stock prices on your brokerage's platform by searching for either the stock's ticker symbol or the name of the company.If your brokerage trades fractional shares, you can purchase any dollar amount of a stock regardless of its share price. Only some brokerages allow you to buy or sell fractional shares. If your broker doesn't, you'd need to round down to the nearest whole number of shares to determine how many you can buy.As an example, let's say you want to invest $1,000 in Microsoft (MSFT  0.67%). You check Microsoft's share price and find that it's $330. Dividing $1,000 by this share price indicates that you can buy up to 3.03 shares. Assuming your brokerage doesn't trade fractional shares, you would purchase three shares of Microsoft stock.\n\n\n4. Choose an order type4. Choose an order typeDifferent order types exist for stock purchases. The type of order you place to buy stock specifies the conditions under which you want your broker to transact on your behalf. Placing a market order, which instructs your broker to buy the stock immediately and at the best available price, is typically the best order type for buy-and-hold investors.However, you may instead want to place a limit order. This indicates to your broker the maximum price for a stock that you're willing to pay. For example, let's say that a stock is currently trading for $20.50 per share. You want to buy it only when the price is less than $20, so you would place a limit order. Your broker would only buy shares on your behalf if the stock's price dips below $20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy Limit Order\n\n\nAn order that instructs your broker to buy a stock or other security only at or less than a specific maximum price.\n\n\n\n\n5. Place the stock order5. Place the stock order with your brokerageTo place a stock order, access the appropriate section of your brokerage's platform. Then and enter the required information.Your brokerage will typically ask for the company or stock ticker name, whether you want to buy or sell shares. You'll also enter either the dollar amount or how many shares you want.After you tap the \"place order\" button, your stock purchase should be executed in a matter of seconds (if the order type is a market order). Your portfolio should immediately update to reflect your ownership of the newly purchased shares.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Stock Market Return\n\nStock market results can vary wildly from year to year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Invest In: Use Your Money to Make Money\n\nSo where should you invest? We've got the options covered.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Invest $100 in Stocks & More\n\nYou can start your investment journey with a small sum of money. Here's what to do with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I Buy Stock Now or Wait?\n\nThe best time to buy a stock is usually yesterday, but think about the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Build your portfolio6. Build your portfolioThe final step in this process is to build out your investment portfolio. Now that you have a brokerage account and know the basics of how to buy and sell stocks, you can keep adding money to your brokerage account and investing in stocks you'd like to own for years to come.As a final thought, it can be tempting to monitor the performance of your stocks every day (especially at first). However, it's important to maintain a long-term mindset.Certainly, you can and should read quarterly reports and subscribe to news alerts. But if your stocks' prices decline somewhat, don't sell in a panic. And, if your stocks' prices rise by a few dollars, resist the urge to cash out. The best and easiest way to build wealth over time is to buy shares of great companies and hold them for as long as the companies remain great.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Schwab is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

{"Article Title":"Top Marijuana Stocks to Invest In","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/stock-market\/market-sectors\/healthcare\/marijuana-stocks\/","Article Content":"The marijuana industry is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of at least 25% through 2030, and many investors are seeking to profit. As states and entire countries decriminalize or legalize cannabis and\/or its components, there are growing opportunities for entrepreneurs and existing companies. This is especially true with President Biden announcing marijuana reforms in October 2022, which could be the first major step toward the federal decriminalization of cannabis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with any nascent industry, there are also plenty of investment risks. Whether you're a first-time investor or a seasoned veteran, it pays to understand how this industry works. This guide will get you up to speed quickly and includes our picks for the top marijuana stocks.\n\n\nBest marijuana stocks to buy in 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen Thumb Industries (OTC:GTBIF)\n\n\nMarijuana grower and retailer\n\n\n\n\nCresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF)\n\n\nMarijuana grower and retailer\n\n\n\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR)\n\n\nAncillary provider\n\n\n\n\nGrowGeneration (NASDAQ:GRWG)\n\n\nAncillary provider\n\n\n\n\nScottsMiracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG)\n\n\nAncillary provider\n\n\n\n\nJazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ)\n\n\nBiotech company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Green Thumb Industries1. Green Thumb Industries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen Thumb Industries ranks as one of the largest U.S. multi-state cannabis operators. It owns over 80 retail cannabis stores in 15 states across the U.S. and operates 18 manufacturing facilities. Green Thumb also holds enough additional licenses to roughly double the number of its retail locations.The company has been profitable on an annual basis since 2020. It continues to deliver revenue growth and maintains a strong balance sheet even with macroeconomic and cannabis industry headwinds. Green Thumb should have plenty of growth potential over the long term as the U.S. cannabis market expands.For now, Green Thumb's shares can only be bought and sold on over-the-counter (OTC) markets in the U.S. But if federal cannabis restrictions are lifted, the stock could be listed on major U.S. stock exchanges. This would almost certainly be a huge catalyst for Green Thumb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver-the-Counter (OTC)\n\n\nOTC is short for \u201cover the counter.\u201d OTC securities trade through decentralized networks instead of a major exchange.\n\n\n\n\n2. Cresco Labs2. Cresco Labs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCresco Labs, like Green Thumb, is based in Illinois. It operates retail cannabis stores in 10 states, including six of the most populated states in the U.S. Cresco is the top wholesaler of branded cannabis products in the U.S.The company is growing rapidly through acquisitions and opening new retail locations. Cresco's pending acquisition of Columbia Care (CCHWF  -4.25%) will make it the largest multi-state operator based on revenue. The acquisition is moving forward with overwhelming approval by Columbia Care shareholders and a thumbs-up from the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Cresco and Columbia Care are divesting some operations to satisfy regulators. Once the deal closes, Cresco will operate in 18 U.S. markets, including 12 states with annual cannabis sales of more than $1 billion.Like Green Thumb, Cresco Labs' shares can currently only be traded on OTC markets in the U.S. The stock will likely be a big winner if the Biden administration moves forward with federal marijuana reforms that allow U.S. stock exchanges to list the shares of cannabis companies that operate in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Innovative Industrial Properties3. Innovative Industrial Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. cannabis companies can't easily secure capital from banks or financial institutions since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIP) helps to solve the cash shortage for growing marijuana companies. It buys properties owned by U.S. medical cannabis operators and leases the properties back to them. The sale to IIP provides the cannabis operator with much-needed cash, and the lease agreements create a steady revenue stream for IIP.Innovative Industrial Properties has grown significantly in recent years and now owns properties in 19 states. The company continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth even with some of its tenants facing financial challenges. Because IIP is organized as a real estate investment trust (REIT), it returns at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders.In some ways, IIP wouldn't be helped as much by federal cannabis reform as other companies. Its shares already trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). If traditional banking services were available to U.S. cannabis operators, IIP could face increased competition. However, federal reforms would likely cause the U.S. cannabis market to expand -- which should work in IIP's favor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nRevenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered.\n\n\n\n\n4. GrowGeneration4. GrowGeneration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowGeneration is another ancillary provider, and the largest specialty retail chain focused on the cannabis market. It operates over 60 stores in 18 states. Because the company's business doesn't violate any existing federal marijuana laws, its stock can trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange without any issues.Demand for the company's hydroponics products has fallen due to an oversupply of cannabis in the U.S. This has caused short-term headwinds for GrowGeneration that are likely to continue in 2023. However, the company's long-term prospects remain bright, and GrowGeneration should be in a position to significantly rebound when market conditions improve.5. Scotts Miracle-Gro5. Scotts Miracle-Gro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro is facing the same supply-and-demand market dynamics as GrowGeneration. Like GrowGeneration, its shares can be traded on a major stock exchange (in this case, the NYSE) since Scotts doesn't violate any federal marijuana laws.The company's Hawthorne Gardening subsidiary ranks as a leading supplier of hydroponic gardening products to the cannabis industry. Hawthorne should have a significant growth runway over the long term despite some near-term challenges.Although Hawthorne Gardening has been a primary growth driver for Scotts, the company still generates the majority of its total revenue from consumer lawn and garden products. Higher commodity prices are currently squeezing margins for the business. However, the company's consumer lawn and garden products provide a relatively steady counterbalance to its cannabis supply unit.6. Jazz Pharmaceuticals6. Jazz Pharmaceuticals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIreland-based Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired the cannabis-focused biotech company GW Pharmaceuticals in May 2021. GW's drug Epidiolex is the first cannabis-based medicine to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Epidiolex, which treats two forms of childhood epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex (a rare disease where benign tumors grow on organs), has been a big commercial success, with sales of $736.4 million in 2022.Jazz is currently evaluating Epidiolex in a late-stage clinical study as a treatment for patients with epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures. Its pipeline also features other cannabis drugs in phase 2 testing, targeting autism spectrum disorders and related issues. In addition to its cannabis products, Jazz markets sleep-disorder and cancer drugs.\n\n\nA brief overview of the marijuana industryLet\u2019s cover some of the basics you need to know before investing in marijuana stocks.The marijuana industry is divided into three broad categories. Marijuana growers and retailers cultivate and package cannabis products and sell them to consumers. Biotechnology companies develop and market cannabis-based pharmaceutical drugs. Ancillary marijuana businesses provide products and services to cannabis companies without touching the plant.Cannabis can be medical or recreational. Medical cannabis patients use cannabis or cannabis extracts to treat health conditions and have recommendations or cannabis prescriptions from physicians. Recreational cannabis users purchase marijuana or cannabis extracts purely for enjoyment and must be 18 and older and living in a jurisdiction where recreational use of the plant is legal.Geography matters. Medical cannabis is legal in many more countries than recreational cannabis. In the U.S., cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. However, a growing number of states have legalized medical and\/or recreational cannabis. And -- as mentioned earlier -- the Biden administration is taking some steps that could lead to federal decriminalization of marijuana. The rapid growth of the U.S. cannabis market is translating into impressive growth by U.S.-based cannabis companies, while marijuana companies in Canada -- where the plant is already fully legal nationwide -- are expanding more slowly. Canada is one of the global legal markets where supply is outpacing demand and leading to falling cannabis prices.\n\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on marijuana stocksThe COVID-19 pandemic affected nearly every part of the global economy, including the cannabis industry. In many U.S. states, cannabis dispensaries were designated as essential businesses. Cannabis sales boomed in some states during the first few months of the coronavirus outbreak, driven in part by more time spent at home and increased anxiety. Marijuana growers and retailers benefited, as did ancillary providers selling gardening supplies and other products to these companies.However, not all cannabis companies fared well in the pandemic. Recreational cannabis retailers in tourist destinations such as Las Vegas saw their customer traffic dwindle, causing some of these dispensaries to start focusing on home delivery. In the medical segment, people delayed doctor visits, causing new patient starts to drop. Biotech companies experienced logistical challenges that affected sales and research progress.To a large extent, the worst appears to be over for the cannabis market with respect to COVID-19, but some effects are still being felt.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Pharmaceutical Stocks\n\nThe makers of the medicines that keep us happy and healthy can be great places to invest.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Genomics Stocks\n\nThese companies study genes and their functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in the Best Healthcare Stocks\n\nHealthcare is a universal need. Companies in this broad-based sector can produce healthy returns.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Psychedelic Stocks\n\nIt turns out that \"magic mushrooms\" may have medical applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you buy marijuana stocks?Just because there's a trendy new sector with lots of press and potential growth doesn't mean you need to invest in it. If you buy broad-based index funds, you're covered no matter which sectors of the stock market do well. Conservative investors who prefer lower risk are likely better off avoiding investing in marijuana stocks.Most of the marijuana stocks mentioned above have fallen significantly over the past 12 months. This pattern underscores the risks that investors face and highlights why using margin to buy these stocks should be avoided. However, the factors causing poor performance (especially a supply-demand imbalance) should be resolved over time.Aggressive investors with high risk tolerances, though, will probably find a lot to like about marijuana stocks. The cannabis industry is still in its early stages. The market opportunities are enormous, especially as more U.S. states legalize cannabis. Investing in these stocks is a high-risk but potentially high-reward proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Speights has positions in Innovative Industrial Properties.

Meanwhile, some ETFs concentrate on specific sectors such as technology or banking.In a challenging market environment, ETFs can help eliminate the risk of owning an individual stock. That's because they tend to be less volatile than individual stocks.

Vanguard 500 Index Fund1. Vanguard 500 Index Fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanguard created the index fund. If you're looking for an S&P 500 index fund, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is hard to beat.It offers a dirt-cheap expense ratio of just 0.03%. That compares to a 0.78% average expense ratio for similar funds. This lower expense ratio means investors will pay just $3 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested with the fund, versus $78 in a typical competing fund.The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs (third in assets under management, or AUM). The ETF's low-cost and large-size combination makes it a great choice if you're looking to invest in the broader market. Because of its history, diversification, and exposure to blue chip stocks, many investors consider it one of the best ETFs to buy and hold.The S&P 500 has an excellent track record of delivering returns for investors. Over the last 50 years, the average stock market return as measured by the S&P 500 is 9.4%, with dividends reinvested. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a low-cost way to capture the market's returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Invesco QQQ Trust2. Invesco QQQ Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for exposure to big tech stocks, Invesco QQQ Trust is an excellent choice. The ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes 100 of the Nasdaq's largest non-financial companies.The top stocks in the ETF are Apple (AAPL  0.3%), Microsoft (MSFT  0.67%), and Amazon (AMZN  0.91%). It also boasts an affordable expense ratio of 0.2%. It's one of the best-performing ETFs over the past decade. The Invesco QQQ Trust has generated a total return of more than 450% (17.6% annually), easily outpacing the S&P 500 at 220% (12.6% annually).The Nasdaq 100 suffered from a challenging bear market for most of 2022 but rallied sharply through mid-2023. Growth stocks tend to rise faster than the overall market in the early stages of a bull market.\n\n\n3. Vanguard Growth ETF3. Vanguard Growth ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth stock investors had been licking their wounds for much of 2022. That\u2019s because rising interest rates pressure growth stocks since they make the discount rate rise in financial models.If that downturn made you tired of trying to pick a growth stock winner when so few were delivering gains, you might want to invest in the Vanguard Growth ETF. The ETF holds large-cap growth stocks and tracks the CRSP US Large-Cap Growth Index. Like the Invesco QQQ Trust and the Vanguard 500 Index, the Vanguard Growth ETF's biggest holdings are Apple and Microsoft. In addition, the growth-focused ETF holds many other growth stocks among its roughly 240 holdings.The Vanguard Growth ETF offers a rock-bottom expense ratio of just 0.04%. Its low cost makes it a good deal for anyone looking for a growth stock ETF.\n\n\n4. iShares Core SP Small-Cap ETF4. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF provides broad exposure to small-cap stocks. Small caps tend to be more volatile than the broader market since they may not be profitable or as well-capitalized as their large-cap counterparts. As a result, small caps tend to be more at risk during a downturn because they may not have the same access to capital.The ETF helps mute some of that risk by owning a large basket of small caps. It held more than 600 stocks as of mid-2023. It has a fairly low concentration of holdings. Its top 10 holdings made up about 7.2% of the total.The ETF has a very low expense ratio, making it a low-cost way to add some small-cap exposure to your portfolio.\n\n\n5. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF5. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend stocks are great long-term investments. Over the last 50 years, dividend-paying companies have outperformed the broader market (9.2% average annual total return versus 7.7% for an equal-weighed S&P 500 Index). The best performance came from dividend growers and initiators (10.2% versus 6.6% for companies with no change in their dividend policy).The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF provides exposure to U.S. stocks with a history of growing their dividends. It held almost 450 dividend stocks as of mid-2023.The ETF offers a relatively attractive dividend yield. As of mid-2023, it had a trailing 12-month yield of 2.6%, more than the 1.5% dividend yield of an S&P 500 Index Fund. Thanks to its low expense ratio of 0.08%, investors get to keep more of the dividend income that the ETF produces. In addition, the fund should deliver price appreciation as the underlying companies grow their earnings and increase their dividends.\n\n\n6. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF6. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the S&P 500 is considered a broad-market index, it only gives you exposure to 500 large-cap U.S. stocks. If you want to own all of the stocks on the U.S. market, the best way to do it is with a total stock market fund such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF. The fund holds roughly 4,000 stocks, including large caps, mid caps, and small caps. Because its holdings encompass the S&P 500, its largest holdings are the same as the broad market index.Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF aims to track the CRSP US Total Stock Market Index. Like other Vanguard funds, it has a low expense ratio of 0.03%, making it an affordable way to invest in the entire U.S. stock market through one ETF.\n\n\n7. iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF7. iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it's international markets you want, the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF is a good way to go. The fund derives its holdings from an MSCI global index and then subtracts the U.S. listings. It has roughly 4,300 stocks, including large caps, mid caps, and small caps from around the world.The ETF offers diversified international exposure. The fund's top five holdings as of mid-2023 were:Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  0.57%): The Taiwanese information technology company makes up 1.6% of the fund's holdings.Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY): The Swiss consumer staples company comprises 1.2% of the ETF's holdings.ASML Holdings (ASML  1.38%): The Netherlands-based semiconductor company makes up 1.1% of the fund's holdings.Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF): The Korean electronics company makes up 1% of the fund's holdings.Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY): The Chinese communications company makes up 1% of the ETF's holdings.The fund allows investors to invest globally at an affordable expense ratio of 0.07%. It also had an attractive dividend yield of 2.3% as of mid-2023, based on dividend payments over the last 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor\n\n\nA semiconductor is a basic element or compound substance that conducts electricity in certain situations.\n\n\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Invest in ETFs for Beginners\n\nExchange-traded funds let an investor buy lots of stocks and bonds at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nETF vs. Index Fund: What Are the Differences?\n\nYour investment style can dictate which kind of fund is best for your portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) ETFs in 2023\n\nIt may be smart to consider investing in one of these artificial intelligence-oriented ETFs.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Electric Vehicle ETFs\n\nWith the auto world switching to EVs, these exchange-traded funds can drive value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre ETFs right for you?Are ETFs right for you?Exchange-traded funds can work for almost any kind of investor regardless of your investing style or the type of stocks you're looking to invest in.There are hundreds of ETFs available that offer exposure to a wide range of sectors, as well as different kinds of investing goals such as dividends or growth. These funds can avoid some of the risk and volatility of investing in individual stocks at a very low cost. They're also a good idea if there's a sector you want to invest in but don't know well enough to pick individual stocks.For most investors, holding at least one or two ETFs makes sense, especially if you want to eliminate some of the work of picking individual stocks. The list above offers a good start if you're looking for some of the best ETFs to buy.\n\n\n\nBuying ETFs FAQs\n\n\nWhat is the best ETF to buy into?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nThere are many good ETFs to buy. The best one for you to buy depends on your personal situation and risk tolerance. However, a smart strategy is to buy ETFs with a low ETF expense ratio focused on roughly matching the performance of a stock market index like the S&P 500. A good option is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.\n\n\n\n\nWhich ETF has the best returns?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAccording to ETFdb.com, the ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF has had the best returns. Over the last five years, this ETF has delivered a 33.6% annualized total return. This leveraged ETF provides two times the daily return of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index. While this ETF showcases the power of leverage (it can produce higher returns in a rising market), it's also a higher-risk investment since that leverage can significantly affect returns during a down market.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the fastest-growing ETF?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nThe First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF is the fastest-growing ETF based on assets under management (AUM). The ETF has increased its AUM from $6 million at the start of 2022 to $791 million as of mid-2023 -- a 12,166% increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

The S&P 500 outperformed each fund slightly, as would be expected when accounting for each fund's expense ratio.At the S&P 500's rate of return, a $10,000 investment made five years ago would have grown into $17,866 by mid-2023.

Given its lower expense ratio, Fidelity's S&P 500 index fund will likely continue to slightly outperform the funds from Schwab and Vanguard over the longer term.\n\n\nWhy are SP 500 index funds popular?Why are S&P 500 index funds popular?An index fund is designed to mirror the performance of a stock index. An S&P 500 index fund invests in each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC). It doesn't try to outperform the index. Instead, it uses the index as its benchmark and aims to replicate its performance as closely as possible.S&P 500 funds are by far the most popular type of index fund. But index funds can be based on practically any financial market, investing strategy, or stock market sector.\u00a0Index funds are popular with investors for a number of reasons. They offer easy portfolio diversification, with some funds providing broad exposure to hundreds or even thousands of stocks and bonds. You don't risk losing all your money if one company collapses like you could with individual investments. However, you also don't have as much upside potential to the astronomical returns that can result from picking a single huge winner.Index funds are passively managed, which means you're not paying for someone to actively pick and choose investments. Passively managed funds result in a lower expense ratio from lower investment management fees compared to actively managed funds.Your money will track the market's performance. Historically, the S&P 500's annual returns have been in the 9% to 10% range. In some years, the index will lose value. For example, during the Great Recession, the S&P 500 lost about half of its value. Meanwhile, the index experienced a bear market starting in early 2022, declining by more than 20% from its peak by the fall. But over the long term, it's always recovered. A 20-year investment has never resulted in a loss in the S&P 500's history.You keep more of your investment profits in your pocket. S&P 500 index funds are low-cost investments. While active managers are likely to match or even beat the market's performance over time, their fees eat away at your returns. Because they're passive investments with low fees, S&P 500 index funds deliver returns that mirror the index's returns over the long term.You're investing in 500 of the most profitable companies in the U.S. The corporations represented in the S&P 500 are subject to stringent listing criteria. To join the index, a company must have a $14.6 billion market capitalization, and the sum of its past four quarters' earnings must be positive. Each company must also get approval from an index committee. The S&P 500's largest holdings include Apple (AAPL  0.3%), Amazon (AMZN  0.91%), Microsoft(MSFT  0.67%), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -0.72%).You can put your investment decisions on autopilot. The S&P 500 has a flawless track record of delivering profits over long holding periods, allowing you to invest without worrying as much about stock market fluctuations. You also don't have to research or follow individual companies. You can simply budget a certain amount and automatically invest it on a regular schedule. This practice is known as dollar-cost averaging. Even if you do pick individual stocks, S&P 500 funds are a good foundation for your investment portfolio since you're guaranteed the returns of the stock market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex Funds vs Mutual Funds: What are the Differences?\n\nIndex funds and mutual funds both pool investors\u2019 money to buy many different securities.

Leveraged ETFs use borrowed money and\/or derivative securities to amplify investment returns or to bet against the index. For example, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF aims to return twice the index's performance each day. So if the index rises by 2%, the ETF's value rises by 4%. If the index falls by 3%, the ETF loses 6%.These leveraged products are intended to be day-trading instruments and have an inherent downside bias over the long term. In other words, a 2x-leveraged S&P 500 ETF over the long term will not return twice the index's performance.Investing in S&P 500 index funds is one of the safest ways to build wealth over time. But leveraged ETFs -- even those that track the S&P 500 -- are highly risky and don't belong in a long-term portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nFAQs on S&P 500 index funds\n\n\nWhat is the best S&P 500 index fund?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAll S&P 500 index funds strive to match the returns of the S&P 500 index less fees.

{"Article Title":"5 Top Hydrogen Stocks to Watch","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/stock-market\/market-sectors\/energy\/hydrogen-stocks\/","Article Content":"Hydrogen is an energy source that emits no greenhouse gases when burned. The only waste product is water vapor, making it a cleaner energy source than fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal.\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe drawback to hydrogen as a fuel source is that it\u2019s rarely found in an easily extractable form like natural gas. And although hydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, most methods emit greenhouse gases. On top of that, it\u2019s not yet made at the scale needed to be economically competitive with fossil fuels.However, that could change in the coming years. Several companies are working hard to tap into the enormous promise of this potentially emission-free fuel.\n\n\nInvesting in hydrogenWhat to know about investing in hydrogenThere are several ways to produce hydrogen. Some methods result in the production of carbon dioxide as a byproduct. For example, the industry describes hydrogen obtained from burning natural gas as \"blue hydrogen.\" Using this form of hydrogen would require carbon capture and storage to trap and store the associated carbon dioxide underground to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.Another method uses renewable energy to power an electrolyzer that splits hydrogen from water molecules. This process produces \"green hydrogen,\" which results in no carbon emissions. Green and blue are two of the many colors used to classify hydrogen by its production method and emissions profile.Hydrogen fuel cells work much like batteries by generating electricity from an electrochemical reaction. Instead of being recharged like a traditional battery, hydrogen fuel cells are refueled with more hydrogen. We can use hydrogen fuel cells to motorize vehicles (cars, trains, buses, maritime vessels, and trucks) and as a stationary power source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Credits\n\n\nCarbon credits are tradeable permits that grant permission to emit a specific quantity of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases.\n\n\n\n\nSome advocates contend that hydrogen might eventually replace natural gas in the pipeline system with some modifications. It could then be used in power plants to generate electricity and as a fuel source for our homes. Because of its potential, some forecasts peg the future value of the clean hydrogen market to be as much as $10 trillion.\u00a0Although clean hydrogen holds great promise as a potential emissions-free fuel source, it's costly to produce. It costs about $1.50 per kilogram to produce hydrogen from natural gas and $5 per kilogram to produce clean hydrogen. The U.S. Department of Energy wants to get the cost of clean hydrogen down to $1.00 per kilogram over the next decade to make it a more competitive fuel source.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest hydrogen stocks to buyBest hydrogen stocks to buy in 2023Given the potential of clean hydrogen, a growing number of companies are getting into the sector. Many energy and industrial companies are in the early stages of exploring the possibility of hydrogen energy.However, a handful of companies are already starting to emerge as early leaders in the sector.

It's a global leader in\u00a0liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing technology and equipment. It's also one of the world's largest suppliers of merchant hydrogen and a leader in hydrogen fuel infrastructure. It has more than 100 hydrogen plants with the capacity to produce 7 million kilograms of the fuel each day.Air Products aspires to be a leader in providing solutions to the world's energy and environmental challenges through gasification, carbon capture, and clean hydrogen. It has several major hydrogen projects underway that it expects to complete in the coming years. Its $7 billion carbon-free hydrogen joint venture in Saudi Arabia is the biggest. The project would use renewable energy to produce 650 tons per day when completed in 2025. The project and others under development position Air Products to remain a leading global hydrogen energy company.2. BP2. BP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBP is a global oil and gas producer with grand lower-carbon energy ambitions. It set a goal to be a net-zero company by 2050 or earlier.Hydrogen is a crucial aspect of its strategy. BP intends to capture a 10% share of the hydrogen market in its core operating areas. That's driving it to advance hydrogen projects across the U.K., Europe, the U.S., and Australia.For example, in the U.K., it's developing plans to build that country's largest blue hydrogen production plant (H2Tesside). It's also developing HyGreen Tesside, a large-scale green hydrogen production facility. The projects could deliver 15% of the U.K.'s 2030 target for low-carbon hydrogen production.\n\n\n3. Plug Power3. Plug Power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug Power is a pioneer in the hydrogen fuel cell industry. It created the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cell technology. It has deployed an industry-leading 60,000 fuel cell systems for the e-mobility market (using electric powertrain technologies to power vehicles and fleets). It's one of the world's largest hydrogen buyers and operates a leading hydrogen refueling network in North America with over 180 fueling stations.Plug Power is building an end-to-end green hydrogen network to produce, store, and deliver the fuel across North America and Europe. It expects to produce 2,000 tons of green hydrogen per day by 2030. The company's strategy of building the world's first green hydrogen ecosystem positions Plug Power as a potential category leader in this massive market opportunity.4. Bloom Energy4. Bloom Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloom Energy's mission is to make clean, reliable, and affordable energy. The company has developed the Bloom Energy Server, an electric power generation platform. It also created the Bloom Electrolyzer, using the same solid oxide technology as its Bloom Energy Server. This product can produce clean hydrogen 15% to 45% more efficiently than others on the market.Bloom Energy believes the Bloom Electrolyzer is a major leap forward for hydrogen. It hopes the technology will enable heavy industries such as steel, chemicals, cement, and glass manufacturing to decarbonize. Bloom Energy can pair its Bloom Electrolyzer with solar energy and\u00a0wind energy\u00a0to generate green hydrogen, which it can store and eventually turn back into electricity for future use.\u00a05. Linde5. Linde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinde has developed several technologies to efficiently compress and safely refuel hydrogen. It also offers technologies to lower the carbon emissions of hydrogen through carbon capture and storage.In 2023, the company agreed to invest $1.8 billion to supply clean energy to a large-scale blue ammonia plant in Texas. Linde plans to build the carbon capture infrastructure needed to sequester more than 1.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, offsetting the emissions of the hydrogen supplied to the plant. It signed a deal with oil giant ExxonMobil (XOM  -1.58%) to transport and permanently store the captured carbon dioxide. The company expects the project to start in 2025.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Energy Stocks\n\nThe economy needs energy across sectors to run smoothly, making these companies potential buys.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Dividend Stocks\n\nGoing green is the future of energy.

As such, it represents a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity.\u00a0However, hydrogen is still developing as a commercially viable fuel source. The industry needs to scale and reduce costs to become competitive with fossil fuels and other emerging technologies like battery storage. Investors might want to watch the sector for a while as they gauge which companies have the best chances of emerging as long-term winners.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nHydrogen Stock FAQs\n\n\nWhat hydrogen stock is Amazon investing in?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, Amazon signed a green hydrogen supply deal with Plug Power. The agreement will provide the e-commerce giant with emissions-free fuel to power some of its fleet starting in 2025. As part of the deal, Amazon received warrants to buy up to 16 million shares in Plug Power.\n\n\n\n\nWho are the biggest green hydrogen companies?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Statista, Green Hydrogen International, Fortescue Future Industries, H2 Clean Energy, CWP Global, BP, and InterContinental Energy had the highest green hydrogen production capacity as of early 2023.\n\n\n\n\nWhich hydrogen ETF is best?\n\nangle-down\n\n\n\nangle-up\n\n\n\n\nAs of mid-2023, three exchange-traded funds focused on hydrogen stocks: Global X Hydrogen ETF (NYSEMKT: HYDR), Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (NYSEMKT: HDRO), and Direxion Hydrogen ETF (NYSEMKT: HJEN). These pure-play hydrogen ETFs are very small (each has less than $40 million of assets under management). They have reasonable ETF expense ratios (between 0.3% and 0.5%) and have similar holdings (around 30 hydrogen stocks).\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew DiLallo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

However, most investors would classify it as one with a dividend yield higher than a common benchmark such as the S&P 500 index or a 10-year U.S. Treasury note. In mid-2023, the dividend yield on the S&P 500 averaged about 1.6%, while the 10-year note was around 3.7%. Many investors would consider any dividend above those levels as high-yield.\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n\n\nThat baseline measurement aside, investors shouldn't buy a stock because of its\u00a0dividend yield\u00a0alone.

AbbVie\n\n\nDrugmaker AbbVie\u00a0has had an excellent dividend track record since its spinoff from\u00a0Abbott Labs (ABT  -1.29%) in 2013. From its inception through early 2023, AbbVie has increased its payout by a whopping 270%. AbbVie has carried on the dividend growth legacy inherited from Abbott by boosting its payout every year.Although AbbVie will lose its patent-protected exclusivity for the top-selling drug Humira in 2023, newer products like\u00a0Rinvoq and Skyrizi should help cushion the blow. Because of that, it's in excellent shape to keep the dividend income flowing and growing.\u00a02. AvalonBay Communities\n\n\nAs one of the largest apartment owners in the country, AvalonBay benefits from collecting steady rental income to support its high-yielding payout. The real estate investment trust (REIT) also boasts a top-tier financial profile. The company's financial strength allows it to expand its apartment portfolio by developing and acquiring new communities.While the company hasn't increased its payout every year, AvalonBay has grown its dividend at a 5% annual rate since its 1994 initial public offering (IPO), including by 3.8% in early 2023. With demand for apartments continuing to grow, the REIT should be able to keep increasing its dividend in the coming years.3. Brookfield Infrastructure\n\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure\u00a0operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure businesses focused on\u00a0utilities, transportation,\u00a0energy midstream, and data. The businesses generate relatively stable cash flow to support its growing dividend. The infrastructure stock delivered its 14th straight year of increasing its payout in early 2023.Brookfield envisions increasing its dividend at a 5% to 9% annual rate over the long term, powered by the organic growth of its existing businesses and acquisitions. The company's organic growth drivers of inflation-linked rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects should grow its funds from operations (FFO) by 6% to 9% per share over the long term. Meanwhile, future acquisitions will further pad its bottom line. The company acquired a European data center platform and a global container leasing company in 2023.4. Brookfield Renewable\n\n\nBrookfield Renewable\u00a0is a sibling company of Brookfield Infrastructure. Brookfield Corporation\u00a0(BN  -2.52%) controls both companies. This Brookfield entity focuses on\u00a0renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind, solar, and energy storage facilities. The assets generate steady cash flow backed by long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and other end users, supporting Brookfield's high-yield dividend.The company also expects to increase its payout at a 5% to 9% annual pace over the long term. Powering that forecast is its organic growth drivers \u2014 including an extensive pipeline of new renewable energy projects \u2014 plus additional acquisitions. Brookfield Renewable has already secured and funded at least 8% annual funds from operations (FFO) per share growth through 2027.5. Duke Energy\n\n\nDuke Energy is a leading utility. The company's electric utilities serve 8.2 million customers across six states, while its natural gas utilities provide gas to 1.6 million customers across five states. Its businesses generate very stable cash flows backed by government-regulated rate structures.Duke has a large-scale investment program underway to expand its transformation and distribution network. These investments should grow its earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually through 2027. The earnings growth should enable the utility to continue growing its dividend.Dividend Stocks 6-106. Crown Castle International\n\n\nCrown Castle is a REIT focused on owning communications infrastructure in the U.S., including cell towers, small cells, and fiber optic networks. Its infrastructure is crucial to supporting the mobile industry's next-generation network: 5G. Crown Castle sees a decades-long opportunity to invest in new 5G-related infrastructure. That should drive 7% to 8% annual dividend growth over the long term. It has grown its dividend payment at a 9% compound annual rate since 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. ChevronThe big oil giant's top financial priority is to sustain and grow its dividend. The company delivered its 36th consecutive annual dividend increase in 2023, one of the longest streaks among oil stocks. Chevron has grown its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate over the last 15 years. Chevron's integrated operations, low-cost oil business, and lower-carbon energy investments position it to sustain and grow its dividend in future years.8. Enbridge\n\n\nCanadian oil pipeline giant Enbridge has been an outstanding dividend stock over the years. It has paid dividends for more than 68 years, including expanding its payout in each of the past 28 years.While the world is transitioning its fuel supply from oil to cleaner alternatives, Enbridge is adapting by investing in infrastructure to support natural gas projects and offshore wind farms. The investments have the company on track to increase its cash flow per share by a mid-single-digit annual rate for the next several years, which should support continued dividend growth.\n\n\n9. Enterprise Products Partners\n\n\nEnterprise Products Partners\u00a0ranks as one of the top players in the\u00a0midstream oil and gas market. The master limited partnership (MLP) has increased its payout for almost a quarter century.While the company currently focuses on fossil fuels, it formed an evolutionary technology group in 2021 to pursue opportunities in the energy transition. The future investments should give Enterprise the fuel to continue increasing its dividend.10. Gilead Sciences\n\n\nGilead Sciences\u00a0pays one of the most attractive dividends in the biotechnology sector. The company has a solid dividend track record, increasing its payout every year since it initiated one in 2015. Its strong HIV franchise is the biotech's anchor.However, Gilead has also been able to cash in on its antiviral treatment Remdesivir, one of the few approved treatments for COVID-19. It has several other promising drugs in the pipeline that should drive continued sales growth in the future.Dividend Stocks 11-1511. Blackstone\n\n\nLeading alternative asset manager Blackstone has a unique dividend policy. The company returns almost all of its earnings to investors via dividends and share repurchases. Because of that, its dividend payment changes each quarter as its earnings fluctuate. However, the overall payment has steadily risen over the years, along with Blackstone's earnings.12. Regions Financial\n\n\nRegions Financial is one of the country's largest banks, focusing on the South and Midwest. Regions Financial has a long history of paying dividends. While the company reset its payment level during the 2008-09 financial crisis, it has increased the dividend 20-fold since that time. \u00a013. Extra Space Storage\n\n\nExtra Space Storage is a REIT focused on owning, operating, and managing self-storage facilities. The company has been one of the best-performing stocks in the REIT sector over the past decade. A big driver is its rapidly rising dividend. Extra Space Storage has increased its payout by almost 550% over the last 10 years.14. 3M\n\n\n3M has been a phenomenal dividend stock. The industrial conglomerate has paid dividends for more than a century, including increasing its payout in each of the past 65 straight years. As such, it's a Dividend King, a company with 50 or more years of consecutive dividend increases. The company's strategy of investing in new products has driven that steady growth. It has expanded its sales and enabled 3M to keep increasing its dividend.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. PfizerPfizer\u00a0has paid dividends for roughly 340 consecutive quarters. The pharmaceutical giant's investments in research and development are paying off. The company developed one of the first vaccines against COVID-19 and followed that up with a successful oral treatment. The commercial successes have enabled Pfizer to continue making research and development (R&D) investments and strategic acquisitions that should increase its cash flow in the future. Pfizer should continue to generate plenty of cash to fund future dividends.Dividend Stocks 16-2016. VICI Properties\n\n\nVICI Properties is a REIT focusing on owning experiential real estate like casinos. The company leases those properties back to operating companies under long-term triple net leases (NNN). The agreements supply it with steadily rising rental income from annual rate increases. The company also steadily invests in new gaming and non-gaming real estate. VICI Properties' growing income has enabled it to increase its dividend in all five years since its formation.17. Realty Income\n\n\nRealty Income lives up to its name. The REIT, which pays a monthly dividend, has made more than 635 consecutive payments. Even better, it has increased its payout more than 100 times since its initial public offering in 1994, expanding it at a 4.4% compound annual rate. That adds up to more than 25 consecutive years.Driving that growth has been a steady diet of acquisitions. Realty Income purchases single-tenant properties in sale-leaseback transactions, acquires larger property portfolios, and merges with other REITs to grow its portfolio, rental income, and dividend.\u00a018. Verizon Communications\n\n\nTelecommunications giant Verizon has been a great income stock over the years. The company delivered its 16th consecutive annual dividend increase in 2022, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. Verizon should be able to continue increasing its dividend as it invests to transition its mobile network to 5G, bringing faster data speeds to its customers.19. Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\n\nPharmacy giant Walgreens has paid dividends for more than 90 years, expanding its payout in each of the past 47. The company expects the streak to continue. It's steadily transforming into a consumer-centric healthcare company that should accelerate its earnings growth. The strategy should enable the company to continue increasing its payout.20. W.P. Carey\n\n\nW.P. Carey is a REIT that owns a diversified real estate portfolio. The company has an excellent dividend track record and has increased its payout each year since its IPO in 1998. Behind that steady growth has been W.P. Carey's ability to steadily expand its portfolio of cash-flowing commercial real estate. With a solid financial profile, the REIT has the flexibility to keep growing in the coming years.\n\n\nRelated investing topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvesting in Dividend Stocks\n\nThese companies pay their shareholders regularly, making them good sources of income.\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Achievers List\n\nThese companies have at least 10 years of dividend growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend Kings of 2023\n\nThese companies have increased their dividends every year for 50+ years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Often Are Dividends Paid on Stocks?\n\nHow often can you expect to be paid a dividend on stocks?\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat income now, more laterAll 20 of these dividend stocks offer an above-average yield, making them stand out in a time when many companies don't pay very high dividends.
