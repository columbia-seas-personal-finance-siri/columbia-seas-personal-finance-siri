{"Article Title":"How to Invest Like Warren Buffett","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/963821\/how-to-invest-like-warren-buffett","Article Content":"Warren Buffett is undoubtedly one of the most respected investors of all time. On paper, Buffett\u2019s investment strategy is pretty simple:Buy businesses, not stocks. In other words, think like a business owner, not someone who owns a piece of paper (or these days, a digital trade confirmation).Look for companies with competitive advantages that can be maintained, or economic moats. Firms that can successfully fend off competitors have a better chance of increasing intrinsic value over time.Focus on long-term intrinsic value, not short-term earnings. What matters is how much cash a company can generate for its owners in the future. Therefore, value companies using a discounted cash flow analysis.Demand a margin of safety. Future cash flows are, by their nature, uncertain. To compensate for that uncertainty, always buy companies for less than their intrinsic values.Be patient. Investing isn\u2019t about instant gratification; it\u2019s about long-term success.Of course, what's simple in theory can be less so in execution.If you want to emulate Buffett\u2019s investment strategy, we\u2019ve compiled some of Morningstar\u2019s work on the approach he and partner Charlie Munger have pursued at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B.

{"Article Title":"Should I Start Investing With Stocks or Mutual Funds?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/985066\/should-i-start-investing-with-stocks-or-mutual-funds","Article Content":"Many new investors might put their money in stocks because they offer the best potential long-term returns. If you have years or decades to invest, as many beginning investors do, you can invest in stocks and see your dollars multiply over the time period.But you might wonder whether you should buy individual stocks or an equity fund, which is a basket of stocks. While it doesn\u2019t have to be an either\/or decision forever, beginning investors are often better starting with funds because they offer some conveniences. We take a closer look at why and give some advice on how to choose a fund.Diversification Is a Fund's Main Benefit One risk of holding only a handful of individual stocks is that if a few failed, it could have a big impact on your overall return. This is called unsystematic or business risk; it's the chance that company-specific issues like poor management or lawsuits could cause a stock's price to permanently plummet. The good news is that you can eliminate this risk by owning many companies, which is called diversifying. When you diversify by owning many stocks, the performance of the overall portfolio would be only minimally affected by a few poor performers. As most funds have dozens (or hundreds) of holdings, you can diversify away unsystematic risk with just one fund in many cases. For many beginning investors, that shortcut is a huge advantage compared with buying and researching individual stocks.You might also benefit from other diversification shortcuts that funds offer. There are also risks if you concentrate your portfolio in a specific sector or geography because that area may perform poorly and hamper your returns. With mutual funds, the portfolio often contains companies across sectors; if you add an international fund or two, you can easily own companies from around the globe (this also spreads your bets across more currencies).However, diversification comes with a drawback: It lessens the impact of high-performing stocks, which some investors might seek. But as Alex Bryan discusses, it\u2019s difficult to beat the market, and you face even more difficulty if you\u2019re just learning the ropes. Many beginners will find that diversification\u2019s downside protection outweighs losing out on the small chance of sky-high returns. Using Morningstar Research to Choose a Fund While a fund can offer shortcuts, beginning investors must still perform meaningful due diligence to find the right pick(s).If you're looking for some help, you can use Morningstar's research. We assign many funds a Morningstar Analyst Rating, which expresses our confidence in whether a fund can beat or mirror its benchmark's return going forward depending on whether it's an active or passive strategy (more on that difference later). For funds that our analysts like, we assign Bronze, Silver, and Gold medalist ratings, with Gold expressing our highest level of conviction.  Evaluating and Choosing the Right Fund(s) for You You might notice that Morningstar awards Medalist ratings to hundreds of funds in many different Morningstar Categories. As a first step, you'll need to determine what type of fund you're looking for. One area of the market investors often use for core stock exposure is the large-cap blend category, which contains large, multinational businesses across many different market sectors. For core foreign-stock exposure, many investors opt for funds in the foreign-stock large-blend categories. Another option is a target-date fund, which contains various underlying funds that combined can satisfy an investor's diversification needs. You can use Morningstar research to find a topnotch choice in your preferred area(s) of the market. That's because Morningstar analysts rank funds relative to peers in their Morningstar Category, or Morningstar-created peer groups that cluster together similar types of funds. If you choose a Gold-rated U.S. large-blend fund, you know that our analysts have high conviction in that fund relative to other large-blend funds.Once you've zeroed in on a category or two, you\u2019ll need to carefully consider your preferences and circumstances to determine the best fund for your needs. Here are some key considerations:Active or Passive You'll have to decide whether you want a passive or active fund. A passive fund's goal is to replicate the return of a designated market segment, and an active fund seeks to outperform the market segment.Why would an investor choose a fund that won\u2019t beat the market, you might ask? Many active fund managers underperform in the pursuit of beating the market (and active funds tend to charge higher fees), which can make the average return of passive investments appealing. (For more on the decision, see \"What Is Passive Investing?\")Traditional Mutual Fund or ETF You'll also have to decide whether you want a traditional mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund, which is a fund that trades on a stock exchange. ETFs are typically passive investments, which means they track an index.Beginning investors won\u2019t notice many huge differences between traditional mutual funds and ETFs, so they can usually choose either (or a mix of both). One notable difference that Ben Johnson highlights is that ETFs have a tax-efficient structure, so you might prefer an ETF if you\u2019re in a taxable account.Costs You'll want to carefully consider a fund's costs because every penny paid in fees is a penny that's no longer available for you to invest. It's easy to find a fund's costs using Morningstar.com quote pages. Here's how:Enter the ticker (1) of the share class you want to invest in to pull up its Quote page.Look for the fund's expense ratio (2), or the annual fee that covers various costs, including the costs associated with managing the fund and selecting investments; administrative costs; and fees associated with brokers that facilitate the purchase and sale of funds.To put the expense ratio into context, you can also check the fund's Fee Level (3), which compares the fund's fees against those charged by category peers.You can also see whether the fund has a load (4), or sales charge.     Investment Minimum Many mutual funds have an investment minimum (5), which is the least amount of money a fund will accept to establish a new account. Some funds have $0 minimums, while others can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars for share classes that are available to individual investors. (If you're unsure what a share class is, see Karen Wallace's How to Choose Among Fund Share Classes.)If you require a small investment minimum, you do have some options:Some funds have a $0 investment minimum, so you could choose only funds that meet these criteria.You can buy most ETFs for a specified price that's usually a few hundred dollars at most.You can gain access to funds for less than the investment minimum in many employer-sponsored retirement plans, like a 401(k).","Article Anthor":"Michael Schramm","Article Date":1590019200000}

No matter the stage of life and investing you\u2019re in, one thing is for certain: You need to save for retirement.One popular way to do this is by enrolling in your company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan. With this retirement savings vehicle, your contributions aren\u2019t taxed and many companies offer an employee match.How Much Should I Contribute to My 401(k)?Some folks have ambitious retirement goals, from those dedicated to the Financial Independence, Retire Early, or FIRE, movement to those who are aiming to save $1 million in their 401(k). What if you don\u2019t fall into, or anywhere near, those categories? No matter your ambitions, there are still limits to guide your contribution plans.Starting in 2023, here are the new 401(k) contribution limits. (Note: Part of your contribution may also come from your employer if they offer a company match.)Under age 50: $22,50050 and over: $30,000Keep in mind, these are limits\u2014not numbers you have to meet every year. One of the most widely used guidelines for setting and tracking your savings goals is Fidelity\u2019s Age-Based Savings Benchmarks.Let\u2019s break it down:Age: 30, Savings: 1 time your salaryAge: 45, Savings: 4 times your salaryAge: 50, Savings: 6 times your salaryRemember, this is just a guideline, and the specifics will vary depending on the individual. How Much Do I Need in My 401(k) to Retire?If you\u2019re following Fidelity\u2019s benchmark as a guideline, your target is 10 times your salary at 67. However, many variables can come into play when it comes to calculating your retirement savings \u201cnumber.\u201d Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance, Christine Benz, also recommends taking these factors into account:What is your \u201cincome-replacement rate\u201d? Find out how much of your working income you\u2019ll most likely need to replace in retirement. Benz recommends a benchmark of 75% to 80%.How much do you expect your retirement spending to change versus what you\u2019re spending now?

He recommends, even it\u2019s small, to make contributions to your 401(k) so you can get a head start.Student Loan Repayments Are Back. What Does That Mean for Your Financial Plan?To help you balance these financial goals, have a plan for paying down your debt. After you figure out how much you owe, how much time you have, and what the interest rates are, consider trying out one of these methods:Debt avalanche: Rank your debts based on the interest rate from highest to lowest, make minimum payments on all the debts, and throw extra cash at the highest interest-rate debt. Once you pay off the highest interest-rate debt, move onto the next highest one.Debt snowball: List your debts from smallest to biggest, make minimum payments on all the debts, and throw the extra cash on the smallest balance. Once you pay that one off, move onto the next debt, and keep building up the snowball until everything is paid off.Develop a plan that works best for you and your situation with these steps.Can I Take a Loan From My 401(k)?What Is a 401(k) Catch-Up Contribution?If you\u2019re 50 or older, you\u2019re eligible for a catch-up contribution. Catch-up contributions are a way for you to save more for retirement later in your life, which can be helpful if you already had a late start.

{"Article Title":"7 Great Investing Books for Beginners","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/942483\/7-great-investing-books-for-beginners","Article Content":"Learning about financial concepts can feel intimidating. Even finding a starting spot can prove challenging. If you search for an investment term on the Internet, you often end up with an alphabet soup of complex financial terms.A better entry point can be picking up a book by an expert who thoughtfully and sequentially presents and explains financial concepts and investing topics. Resources like these can help you realize that investing doesn\u2019t have to be intimidating or complicated. Here are the best investing books for beginners that are great places to get started.Prefer podcasts? This list has you covered.1. The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing, by Benjamin GrahamBenjamin Graham is known as the father of value investing. He taught Warren Buffett, a modern investing icon. His book lays a framework for evaluating a business\u2019 worth based on financial value, not short-term trading techniques. In his book, Graham defined many important investing concepts such as \u201cmargin of safety,\u201d which is an important input in the Morningstar Rating for stocks. The revised edition includes commentary from The Wall Street Journal's personal-finance columnist Jason Zweig that contextualizes and modernizes the text. With Zweig's commentary on every chapter, the book is north of 500 pages, which is a lot; however, it's a thorough introduction to investing. If getting through means skimming a few chapters, no judgment here.2. A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, by Burton MalkielIf Graham teaches you how to evaluate a business, Burton Malkiel explains why that might not help you. The Princeton economist argues that markets demonstrate efficiency because people are analyzing a company\u2019s value. (Efficiency means a company\u2019s share price reflects its current worth, and its price will change when new information alters a business\u2019 worth.) Malkiel recommends earning the market\u2019s return instead of beating it, which he compellingly argues is good enough. The book was first published in 1973, but updated editions have added contemporary topics. These include exchange-traded funds and investment techniques like smart beta (which Morningstar prefers to call \"strategic beta,\" but I digress).3. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns, by John BogleInvesting icon John Bogle died on Jan. 16, 2019, but he left behind an impressive legacy: He revolutionized the mutual fund industry and was a tireless advocate for investors. He pioneered the index fund, which allowed investors to gain diversified exposure to the stock market at a very low cost, helping them keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets. His book explains why low fees significantly affect returns. It also addresses topics like mean-reversion and tax costs. The text is accessible and shorter than many other investing books, and it includes quotes from many prominent financial figures who support Bogle's claims.4. Morningstar\u2019s 30-Minute Money Solutions: A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your Finances, by Christine BenzEven if you understand investing basics, you might struggle to incorporate them into your personal finances. Executing them in manageable steps can prove even more challenging.That's the beauty of this book. Christine Benz, Morningstar's director of personal finance, breaks financial planning down into bite-size chunks that anyone can handle. You start with basics like assessing your net worth and creating an organization system, and you progressively conquer more advanced topics including retirement investing, college savings, and estate planning.If you want to meld investment basics with tangible advice, this book is a great option.5. The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, by Warren BuffettMany consider Warren Buffett to be the best modern investor. He has risen to fame as Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s CEO, a position he\u2019s held for over 50 years. Berkshire Hathaway invests in high-quality businesses with strong growth potential. But Buffett only buys such companies when they\u2019re selling at an attractive margin of safety (hat tip to his mentor, Benjamin Graham). This makes Buffett an extreme stock-picker. Under his reign, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s growth has far surpassed that of the S&P 500, a testament to the success of his approach.Each year, Buffett writes an annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, and all of them are published on the company's website, so anyone can read them. Buffett writes in a straightforward style that is accessible to investors of all skill levels, and he's often very funny to boot. \"The Essays of Warren Buffett\" weaves together Buffett's essays into a sequential, cohesive book.12 Lessons on Money and More From Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger6. The Bogleheads\u2019 Guide to Investing, by Taylor Larimore, Mel Lindauer, and Michael LeBoeufThe advice of The Vanguard Group founder John Bogle is echoed in this comprehensive guide for investors of all experience levels. Packaged into 23 short, light-hearted chapters, this book contains practical advice and explores many aspects of investing, from how to choose the financial lifestyle that fits you to how to balance your emotions to truly master your investments. This guide also provides external resources and other information for readers who want to dive deeper into any of the topics that the longtime Bogleheads cover. A second edition of the book was released in 2014 and includes updated chapters on tax law changes, 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans, and backdoor Roth IRAs.The Bogleheads are investing enthusiasts who honor Bogle and his advice, living by a philosophy to \"emphasize starting early, living below one's means, regular saving, broad diversification, simplicity, and sticking to one's investment plan regardless of market conditions.\" Members actively discuss financial news and theory in a forum.7. I Will Teach You to Be Rich, by Ramit SethiAdvisor and The New York Times best-selling author Ramit Sethi outlines a six-week program for 20- to 35-year-olds to learn the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing. Sethi shares his strategies for eliminating student loans and debt; finding a balance with saving and spending every month; and preparing to purchase a house or car. In the newest edition, he includes stories from readers and insights on the psychology of investing. Sethi strives to demonstrate to investors how to make investments that grow with them and their goals, and how they can spend their money on the things they want without feeling guilty.Our Favorite Best Investing BooksStill have room on your shelf?

Nassim Nicholas Taleb also focuses on randomness. He believes that humans look for or come up with explanations when there aren\u2019t any, emphasizing that sometimes things just simply happen. Seeking these explanations then affects our financial decisions and can form certain habits.The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor, by Howard MarksChairman and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management Howard Marks shares his journey in investment management and uses his experiences to shine a light on what is going on in the stock market today.

{"Article Title":" How to Invest In Your 401(k)     ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/993124\/how-to-invest-in-your-401k","Article Content":"Editor's note: This article originally ran on Jul. 24, 2020.This month marks a significant milestone for my family as my oldest child, who graduated from college in May, begins his first full-time job, which gives him access to a 401(k) for the very first time.Given the work my team at Morningstar does providing advice on 401(k) lineups, along with the many years I've spent researching and working on retirement products, I felt I was well-placed to offer my son a few tips on how to best invest in his own 401(k). I hope these guidelines will be valuable to others starting their careers or looking for a refresher. Note that while I reference 401(k)s throughout this article, my comments are generally applicable to workers whose employers offer 403(b) or 457 plans instead, which are intended for nonprofit, governmental, and educational institutions.Here are some insights into how 401(k)s work and my top suggestions for getting the most out of yours:What a 401(k) Is, and What It's Not  Although the 401(k) plan wasn't originally designed to be the primary retirement vehicle for U.S. workers, the decline of pension plans since the early 1980s has forced plans like 401(k)s to occupy that role. The key consequence for most new workers is that the heaviest burden of saving for retirement now rests largely on their shoulders. A 401(k) aids in that process by granting you a tax benefit: first by allowing you to defer a portion of your salary before taxes, and second by allowing those savings to compound tax-free. Down the road you will then pay income taxes on the distributions you take. If it's made available by your employer, the newer Roth 401(k) flips that around by taking away that up-front tax benefit but allowing you to take the distributions tax-free later on.Taking the First Step  To borrow from the immortal catchphrase of Star Trek's USS Enterprise Captain Jean-Luc Picard, your first and most important step with respect to a 401(k) is simply to \"engage\" with it by signing up for the plan. When it comes to sending a percentage of your paycheck to your 401(k) account, my message is to start with whatever you can afford, even if it's a small percentage--ideally up to the level of your company match.There are several benefits in doing so. One is simply to develop the habit of investing early in your career, which can become second nature and be built upon as your cash flow increases. Another is the power of compounding interest. Although the dollar amounts trickling into your account early on may seem depressingly small, you can look at any number of models to see how the steady accumulation of even small amounts over very long periods of time reaps great rewards. In the past, we've demonstrated how you could attain a $1 million account balance at age 65 by contributing just a shade over $5,000 per year (including employer matches), if you started at age 22. Delaying your first investment until age 30 would drive up that required annual amount to nearly $9,000. So, it's in your best interest to start early.Learn to Juggle  Many young people are struggling to balance multiple financial goals, including regular expenses, multiple forms of debt payments, and the need to build up an emergency fund. Experts have differing views on how to prioritize managing expenses and debt. My own view is that, to the extent possible, you should try to tackle multiple goals at once.As noted above, if you can start out with making even small contributions to your 401(k), you'll be giving yourself a huge head start. And this sort of financial juggling is something you'll have to do throughout your life. Later on, it may involve saving for an automobile, a house, or a child's tuition, so take advantage of only having to worry about a few things now and establish good habits.If you happen to be working remotely from your parents' house right now while saving on rent, travel, and eating out, there's no time like the present to use that extra income to build up your emergency fund and stash more in your 401(k).Raise the Stakes  You may be wondering how much you should invest in your 401(k). It goes without saying, of course, that the more you can invest, the better.Once you've established that regular contribution habit, there are relatively painless ways to increase your contribution rate over time. One is to sign up for an \"auto-escalation\" feature that many plan providers offer, allowing you to automatically raise your contribution rate by a preset amount on a regular schedule--say by 1% or 2% each year.Another option is to commit to lifting your contribution rate by the amount of your raise each year, which will have no effect on your take-home pay. A more advanced move is to devote a higher share of any bonuses you receive to your 401(k), which will help plump up your account value.Mind the Match Another way to compound the effects of your 401(k) contributions is to take advantage of any employer-matching program that might be available. Matches are typically constructed to mirror a certain percentage of your own contributions, up to a given level. For instance, an employer might contribute 50 cents on the dollar up to a 6% deferral rate.In that scenario, let's say you earn a salary of $60,000 per year. If you elect to contribute at the 6% level, that means you'll put in $3,600 of your own money during the year, plus your employer would contribute an additional $1,800. (Keep in mind that you'll also be reducing your taxes because the pretax contributions will lower the income level that you declare to the IRS.)Two things should be called out here, though. First, there is occasionally a brief waiting period of a few weeks before an employee is eligible to participate in these kinds of plans. Second, while your employer may contribute to your 401(k), there will likely also be something called a vesting schedule in place that determines when you gain full ownership of employer contributions. In many cases you won't have access to 100% of your employer's contributions for a couple of years. (Your own contributions are always yours, even if you switch jobs.) Since this is \"free money\"--or, more accurately, additional compensation from your employer--most advisors recommend contributing at least up to the level of the employer match to get the biggest possible benefit.5 Ways to Keep Investments Simple  We've all heard stories about young people opening up Robinhood accounts and day-trading stocks to their hearts' content. Let me categorically say that your 401(k) is not the place to take unnecessary risks or get overly complicated. As I've written in the past, a simple approach to choosing 401(k) investments is often the best.Here are five methods you can use to do just that:1) Consider Target-Date Funds These funds offer a convenient way to invest money that will grow over time and shift your investments from riskier stocks with potentially higher returns to more secure bonds as you get closer to retirement. It's best for you to pick a vintage year closest to when you'll turn 65.2) Consider Index (Passive) Funds These funds track an entire market (the S&P 500, for example) at once. Consider selecting a broad equity index fund or combining a U.S. and international index to have a wider variety of assets working in your favor.3) Avoid Trendy Areas of the Market Don't choose to invest in a fund just because it's had great recent returns, as research shows that markets tend to be heavily mean-reverting. Remember, in retirement, you're playing the long game.4) View Active Funds With Caution Be wary of actively managed mutual funds, which may have higher fees, more erratic performance, and generally require more attention on your part.5) Stick With Your Plan's Options If your plan offers a brokerage window where you can access stocks, exchange-traded funds, and funds not available through your plan, it's best to pretend it doesn't exist. Lock It Up and Throw Away the Key  I'm exaggerating for the sake of effect here, but I often think that one of the most helpful steps investors can take is to simply forget the passwords to their accounts, depriving them of the ability to constantly check their balances.If you've made smart, strategic choices up front, and you have the benefit of a time horizon of 30 to 40 years, there's really no reason to check in on your account on anything more frequent than an annual basis. The quarterly ups and downs of the stock market are irrelevant to your long-term returns, and checking in during a bear market may induce you to panic and make poor, emotionally driven decisions.During that annual check-in, you should make sure that none of your holdings have performed significantly out of line with your expectations. If you've gone the route of selecting a target-date or index fund, you likely won't have much to do in the way of reallocating. But if you have selected multiple funds from multiple asset classes, you should rebalance if weightings have diverged significantly from your targets. It's also a good time to consider raising your contribution rate if you haven't signed up for an auto-escalation feature.Note that there are ways to gain access to your 401(k) funds prior to retirement, but doing so is generally not recommended. \"Hardship\" withdrawals are allowable if you meet certain criteria defined by the IRS, but you will be subject to taxes and penalties.You can also take a loan from your 401(k), which you then repay through additional contributions to your account at a predetermined (usually variable) interest rate. Just know that depleting your 401(k) assets can do serious damage to your long-term investment plan, so you should only consider it under extreme circumstances. (Here's a more detailed list providing 20 common mistakes that investors make with their 401(k)s).Don't Let Your 401(k) Stress You Out  First jobs are a time of anticipation, excitement, and exploration. Take the time to make the most of your work experience and don't let your 401(k) become a source of stress. Get the big picture right with a low-key approach like I've described above, then devote your energy to building your career skills. In the end, your human capital will drive your earnings growth, and therefore your retirement savings, more than any other action you can take in your 20s.","Article Anthor":"Josh Charlson","Article Date":1620345600000}
{"Article Title":" Roth or Traditional IRA: Which Should You Choose?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/942793\/roth-or-traditional-ira-which-should-you-choose","Article Content":"Editor\u2019s note: A version of this article was initially published on Aug. 26, 2019. This content is part of Morningstar\u2019s Tax and IRA Guide special report.I get this question a lot. Or, rather, it's usually something like, \"Which is better?\"Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs both offer tax-advantaged growth of money. The contribution for both account types for 2021 is $6,000, or $7,000 if over age 50. The biggest difference between the account types comes down to when you pay taxes on the money. With that in mind, here is the first question to ask yourself: Do you think you'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement than you are now?You'll be forgiven if--like me--you don't really know the answer to this question. But here's the conventional wisdom: If you have reason to believe you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you are now, it might be wise to stick with a traditional IRA (in other words, pay taxes on the money later, when your income tax rate will be lower).Conversely, if you are just starting your career and there's a good chance that you will be in a higher tax bracket later in life, a Roth could be a better choice because you'll pay income tax at your current (lower) tax rate. But there are other considerations, too. If you are on a very tight budget and could really use the tax deduction now, a traditional IRA could be the way to go. Here are some additional questions to help you decide.I Think My Tax Bracket Will Be Higher in Retirement If you think your tax bracket will be higher in retirement than it is now, you might lean toward a Roth IRA. But you need to ask yourself a few more questions to see if you qualify.     Source: Morningstar.Of course, if you really want to open a Roth IRA but you aren't eligible to contribute because your income is too high, you can do a backdoor Roth maneuver. With a Roth IRA, you pay tax now. You contribute to a Roth IRA using aftertax money, and you can't deduct the contribution from your taxable income. But when you do withdraw the money in retirement, it's tax-free.Roth IRA contributions are also subject to certain income limits. A single filer and head of household can make a full contribution if your income is below $125,000 and a partial contribution up to $140,000. For married filing jointly, you can make a full contribution if your income is less than $198,000, and a partial contribution up to $208,000.You can withdraw contributions you made to your Roth IRA anytime, tax- and penalty-free. However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties if you withdraw the earnings in your Roth IRA prior to age 59 1\/2. If you are 59 1\/2 or older but haven't had the account for more than five years, your earnings may be subject to taxes but not penalties.Unlike a traditional IRA, you aren't required to take withdrawals after age 72.I Think My Tax Bracket Will Be Lower in Retirement If you think your tax bracket will probably be lower when you're in retirement than it is now, a traditional deductible IRA might serve you better. But there are some considerations with that, too:     Source: Morningstar.With a traditional IRA, you pay tax later. When you contribute to a traditional IRA, if your income is below certain limits, you may be eligible to deduct the contribution from your adjusted gross income, which means you won't pay tax on it now. Beginning at age 59 1\/2, you can withdraw money from your traditional IRA; at that time, you will pay income taxes on the amount withdrawn.For single filers who are covered by a company retirement plan, you can deduct the full contribution if your modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI, is below $66,000, and a partial deduction up to $76,000 ($105,000 and $125,000 for married filing jointly). If your spouse is covered by a retirement plan but you are not, the deduction is phased out between $198,000 and $208,000. If neither you nor your spouse is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you are eligible to take the full deduction.If you withdraw the money before you turn 59 1\/2, you may be subject to a 10% penalty on the withdrawal.Beginning at age 72, you will be required to take taxable withdrawals from your account or you will be subject to a penalty.I Have No Idea What My Tax Bracket Will Be When I Retire! If you don\u2019t know what the future holds--and many people fall into this category!--it\u2019s a tax-savvy idea to split the difference. Contribute to both account types if you can. If you do, you will have the freedom to choose whether you pay taxes on your income in retirement or not.","Article Anthor":"Karen Wallace","Article Date":1612224000000}
{"Article Title":" What Is an HSA?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/965982\/what-is-an-hsa","Article Content":"A health savings account offers powerful tax benefits that stretch your healthcare dollars further. You contribute pretax dollars to the account, and your invested money grows tax-free. You can also withdraw money tax-free if you use it for qualified medical expenses. This triple tax benefit makes HSAs a helpful tool with two roles: You can spend money on current healthcare expenses or invest to cover future ones.You also keep your HSA money until you use it, even if you change employers. This portability differentiates an HSA from a flexible spending arrangement, another account that covers healthcare expenses. You usually lose FSA money if you change employers or have any remaining funds after the plan year (with a few exceptions).Do I qualify for an HSA? You have to be enrolled in a health insurance plan that qualifies as a high-deductible health plan. Your deductible is how much you pay before your insurance kicks in\u2014meaning it starts covering part or all of each eligible healthcare expense. For 2022, a high deductible is at least $1,400 for a self-only insurance plan and $2,800 for a family plan. (Note that the IRS regularly adjusts these figures upward for inflation.) Your health insurance plan's out-of-pocket maximum also cannot exceed $7,050 (or $14,100 for family coverage). You also cannot be a dependent on a tax return, enrolled in Medicare, or enrolled in another health insurance plan (unless permitted under other health coverage).What is the maximum HSA contribution for 2022? In 2022, you and your employer can contribute to your HSA, but combined contributions must be at or below $3,650 for a self-only insurance plan and $7,300 for a family plan. If you're over age 55, you can contribute $1,000 more each year.What can I buy with HSA money? You can spend HSA dollars on qualified medical expenses, which generally include dental, vision, and prescription costs. (You can see a full list of qualified medical expenses on the IRS website.) You'll pay a steep 20% penalty and regular income tax on HSA withdrawals used for nonqualified medical expenses, so try contacting your doctor's office if you're unclear whether a healthcare expense qualifies. Where should I open my HSA (and does it impact how I contribute)? If your employer sponsors an HSA that qualifies as a section 125 cafeteria plan, you may want to start your search there. If you elect to defer part of your pretax salary into the employer-sponsored HSA, these contributions (and any employer match) are not subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes. You won't reap this additional tax benefit by contributing aftertax dollars to your HSA (though you can still deduct the contributions from your taxable income when filing income taxes).You might also receive some extra benefits from an employer-sponsored HSA. Your employer might contribute money to your HSA (though you can transfer any funds into another HSA, as Morningstar's director of personal finance Christine Benz has explained). Additionally, some employers cover the HSA fees that you'd pay if you opened the HSA on your own.If your employer doesn\u2019t sponsor an account, you can use Morningstar Research to find the best HSAs. Our analysts rate HSAs on various criteria including fees, interest rates, and investment quality\u2014depending on whether you use the account for spending or investing. How should I use my HSA? Many people use their HSAs as spending vehicles\u2014in other words, they use their HSAs to pay for qualifying medical expenses.Others, however, also use their HSAs as investment vehicles if they do not need to use their HSAs to cover medical expenses or if they have more money in their HSAs than they need each year to cover medical costs. If you plan to spend and invest with your HSA, consider keeping at least your deductible amount (or even your maximum-out-of-pocket amount) in cash to cover expenses and invest the rest.Are there any other ways that I can use an HSA? You can use HSA funds in these other ways:As a retirement account: Benz notes that after age 65, you can withdraw HSA money for any purpose and avoid the 20% tax penalty. However, you'll pay regular income tax on withdrawals for nonqualified medical expenses.To pay insurance premiums under COBRA: You generally can\u2019t use HSA money to cover an insurance premium or regular payments for an insurance policy. However, if you lose your job and you keep your insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act\u2019s (COBRA) continuation coverage, you can pay the premium with HSA funds. Using tax-advantaged HSA dollars to pay COBRA premiums is a helpful benefit, because COBRA enrollees are often responsible for paying the entire premium.","Article Anthor":"Michael Schramm","Article Date":1632787200000}

","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/878897\/what-does-it-take-to-have-a-1-million-401k","Article Content":"Editor's note: This article originally ran on Sep. 5, 2019. It\u2019s since been updated to reflect new data.Let's say your goal is to save a million dollars by the time you retire. For many people, that sounds like a Herculean task.What are you picturing right now? If you are imagining squirreling away money for decades and holding it in cash (which has returned 0.4% after inflation* over the past 90 years), you would need to sock away a lot of money to get to a million. And along the way, your budget could be really tight. Change your mental picture. Instead, invest in your 401(k) (or another retirement savings account) with the goal of having a million dollars in 30 to 40 years. Although it may sound like it's just semantics, it's actually much easier--especially if you start saving early--to let your investments do as much heavy lifting as possible.What Does It Take? You can contribute up to $19,500 to a 401(k) in 2021. But the good news is that you don't have to save anywhere near that much per year if your goal is to have a million dollars at retirement age (65), provided you start early. The earlier you start investing, the longer your investment will compound (your money will grow exponentially). You can do the math yourself if you have a financial calculator, but in case you don't (or you don't have it handy), here's an example of a 25-year-old who has not yet begun saving.     What about that market rate of return? How do I know what stocks will return over the next 40 years? The truth is I don't, and neither does anyone else. If we did know, we would know exactly how much we need to save to reach our goal. But since we don't, we will make educated guesses instead.Here's how I came up with 7%. Over the past 90 years, stocks (as benchmarked by the S&P 500) have returned about 10% per year on average. Adjusted for inflation (which is referred to as the \"real\" return), stocks have gained around 7% per year on average. Does that mean the S&P 500 will earn around 7% after inflation in every year going forward? Of course not--this is just the smoothed-out, average annual return over the past 90 years. Importantly, there is just no accurate way to guess what stocks will do over short-term periods. Over a multidecade period, though, 7% per year is as reasonable an estimate as any. Again, though, there are no guarantees. If you want to be more conservative in your estimate, you can use 6% or 5% as the return for stocks. The result of lowering the growth rate will be that the recommended savings amount rises: In other words, the market won't do as much heavy lifting and you will have to save more. The downside of saving more in the present is that you may have to keep a pretty tight budget, which can be challenging. The upside, obviously, is that you'll have more money saved.Don't forget: Part of your contribution might come from your employer in the form of a company match. Let's say your employer matches the first 5% of your 401(k) contribution at $0.50 on the dollar. That means that if you save at least 5% of your paycheck ($2,000 if your base salary is $40,000), your employer will kick in $1,000. So that means that you only have to save $4,000 per year (10% of your salary) to get into the ballpark you want to be in.Is a Million Going to Be Enough? Now that we've figured out how to save a million dollars, we should ask ourselves if that's even an appropriate target. It's a considerable amount of money and it's a lot more than many people have when it comes time to retire. But if you have many decades until retirement, inflation takes a toll and you might find that a million dollars just isn't a whole lot of money. The goal in retirement savings and drawdown is to maintain your current lifestyle, plus or minus some expenses--maybe more travel spending but less money required for commuting and new clothing. Many people focus on replacing 80% of their preretirement paycheck. Remember, too, that Social Security will provide some income in retirement. Also--and this is something that people sometimes forget--you still have some earning power in retirement, especially if you maintain a modest allocation to stocks in your portfolio.For that reason, it's recommended that you base your savings goal on your household's anticipated cash flow needs rather than on an arbitrary number. For example, Fidelity periodically releases recommended age-based savings benchmarks expressed in terms of multiples of salary (see this article in Fidelity Viewpoints).     These savings \"guideposts\" are Fidelity's, not Morningstar's. I think they they are pretty decent benchmarks. The problem with homing in on a dollar amount is that it might be a lot more or a lot less than you will need in retirement, depending on your current salary and lifestyle.Saving a considerable amount for your retirement isn't impossible. It can be difficult, of course--especially in the early stages of a career when incomes tend to be lower. But hopefully you can afford to sock away $100 to $200 per paycheck. Though for some it may be out of reach, for others it may be more achievable than they thought.* To find rate of return for cash, I used the compound annual growth rate of a T Bill over the period from 1928-2018 (3.4%). (A T Bill is debt instrument backed by the U.S. Treasury that has a maturity of less than one year.) I then used Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI data to come up with a compound growth rate for inflation over the same period (3.0%).","Article Anthor":"Karen Wallace","Article Date":1620345600000}
{"Article Title":" Morningstar's Guide to Stock Investing    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/988220\/morningstars-guide-to-stock-investing","Article Content":"At Morningstar, we take an owner-oriented approach to stock investing. What does that mean? When investors buy stocks, we don't think they're just buying tickers or stories. Rather, they're buying partial ownership in companies. As such, we think it's important to understand a company's fundamentals before purchasing its shares.Our approach to stock investing boils down to three basics: having an intimate knowledge of the company's sustainable competitive advantages, determining what its shares are worth, and then only buying the stock when there's a significant margin of safety in doing so.Let's unpack that a bit. We encapsulate our opinion of a company's competitive advantages in the Morningstar Economic Moat Rating. From our perspective, these are the types of companies that are able to effectively fend off competitors and earn high returns on capital for years to come. A company whose competitive advantages we expect to last more than 20 years has a wide moat; one that can fend off their rivals for 10 years has a narrow moat; while a firm with either no advantage or one that we think will quickly dissipate has no moat.Our fair value estimates are our take on what we think a company's shares are worth. We look beyond fleeting metrics, such as a company's recent earnings or any stock price momentum. Rather, we calculate fair value estimates based on how much cash we think a company will generate in the future. Our fair value uncertainty rating--depicted as low, medium, high, very high, or extreme--depicts the level of uncertainty around our fair values estimate, based on things like a company's sales predictability, operating and financial leverage, and exposure to contingent events.Lastly, the Morningstar Rating for stocks indicates whether a stock is undervalued (4 or 5 stars), fairly valued (3 stars), or overvalued (1 and 2 stars) based on where a stock's market price is relative to our fair value estimate, adjusted for uncertainty. This guide takes a deeper dive into our process for evaluating and rating stocks and provides useful insight into how to make the most of our company reports.How to Read a Morningstar Stock Analyst ReportWhat Makes a Moat?The Morningstar Economic Moat RatingThe Morningstar Fair Value Estimate Why Do Stocks' Fair Value Estimates Change?The Morningstar Rating for StocksThe Morningstar Rating for Stocks Do's and Don'tsHow to Use Morningstar Ratings to Find Quality StocksQuick Definitions: Key Morningstar Terms Economic MoatFair Value EstimateFair Value UncertaintyMorningstar Rating for Stocks","Article Anthor":"Susan Dziubinski","Article Date":1592179200000}
{"Article Title":" Key Factors for Evaluating Mutual Funds    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/990067\/key-factors-for-evaluating-mutual-funds","Article Content":"If you're currently saving for retirement--or looking to get started saving--you might be wondering how to assess the quality of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.There are a few main areas that form the foundation of Morningstar manager research analysts' evaluations of funds, known as the Morningstar Medalist ratings. We'll walk you through all these Pillars--Process, People, and Parent--and we'll show you a quick and easy tool you can use to see how your fund picks work together in a portfolio.How Has the Fund Performed? Performance may be the first thing many people look at when evaluating a fund, but it's not the most important consideration and it certainly shouldn't be the only one. For one thing, a fund's trailing returns won't tell you much about what role a fund could play in a portfolio. And they also won't tell you too much about how the fund will perform in the future. By clicking on \"expanded view\" on the Performance tab, you can take a closer look at how a fund has performed during different market conditions. The Performance chart also helps you put returns into context by showing performance relative to both a benchmark index and Morningstar Category peers, which are other funds that invest in a similar way.You can find more helpful information on a fund's Risk tab. A fund's Morningstar Risk score can tell you how volatile a fund's returns have been relative to category peers. (A fund must have three years of performance history in order to receive a Risk score.) The score assesses the variations in a fund's monthly returns (with an emphasis on downside variations--the ones that keep investors up at night) in comparison to similar funds. The greater the variation, the larger the Risk score.You can pair a fund\u2019s Risk score with its Morningstar Return score, which is an assessment of the fund's excess return compared with category peers. (Again, funds with less than three years of performance history do not receive a Return score.) Funds with Low Risk scores and High Return scores have earned higher returns than peers while taking on much less risk. You can find a visual representation of how a fund's Risk and Return scores compare to peers on the Risk tab.     What Is the Strategy, and How Well Have the Managers Executed It? Morningstar analysts evaluate a fund's performance in the context of its strategy, and you should, too. When you select a fund, it's important to understand how it invests and what type of performance profile you can expect from it. When you look at the fund's past performance, see if it jibes with what you would expect from the fund's stated objective.For example, you would expect an aggressive growth fund to outperform in strongly rising, growth-favored markets. You would expect a fund that plies a defensive strategy, either by investing in stocks with a more-defensive profile or by allocating a portion of assets to bonds or less-volatile asset classes, to protect capital better during market sell-offs. But that defensive fund might look pretty dull in red-hot markets, and that growth fund probably looks abysmal when stocks take a nosedive. Understanding how funds invest and behave in different markets, as well as the different roles they play in a diversified portfolio, will help you maximize your wealth-building potential. (More on that later.)Morningstar analysts thoroughly evaluate a fund's strategy when they rate a fund's Process, which is one of the three Pillars, along with People and Parent, that determine a fund's Medalist Rating. The ratings, which are a feature of Premium Membership, are forward-looking and express how much conviction our analysts have in a fund's or ETF's ability to outperform its peers in the future. Analysts give higher ratings to funds whose performance objective and investment process (for security selection, risk management, and portfolio construction) are sensible, clearly defined, and repeatable. The process must also have be implemented effectively; in this context, trailing returns can be informative. Who's Running the Fund? You should also give consideration to the team running a fund. This includes not only the managers' tenure and demonstrated skill in executing the strategy, but the analyst team supporting those managers.We've found that mutual funds and ETFs run by high-quality management teams tend to outperform their benchmark and peers. To evaluate an investment\u2019s management team (the People rating), Morningstar analysts assess the fund managers\u2019 and analysts\u2019 experience and ability; their workload; and the depth of direct and indirect resources that support them.Analysts consider other factors, too, such as whether fund managers invest alongside investors and whether their pay incentives are aligned with investors\u2019 interests. Prospective investors can check publicly available SEC filings to see how much each fund manager has invested in the fund; this is a way to ascertain whether the managers' interests are truly aligned with shareholders'.The parent fund company's behavior also matters. Morningstar analysts ask a lot of questions to determine whether a fund company is a good steward of investor capital (the Parent rating). For example, is the fund firm dominated by a sales culture or an investment culture? Does the company often launch funds in hot-performing sectors of the market, whether or not they have demonstrated investment expertise in the style? Does the fund company have a history of closing strategies after a periods of strong returns and frothy inflows? Fund closures can be a sign of a shareholder-friendly fund parent--one that doesn't prioritize asset-gathering at the cost of sacrificing current shareholders' future returns.How Much Does It Cost? Price is one of the best predictors of a fund's future returns. That's because a fund's costs come right off the top of its total return.As explained in this article, you can use Morningstar to check a fund's price and see whether it's a good deal relative to other funds that invest the same way.     How Well Do Your Investments Work Together? Not all great funds work well together.

{"Article Title":" What Are Target-Date Funds?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/808120\/what-are-target-date-funds","Article Content":"Editor\u2019s note: A version of this article ran on May 7, 2021.There are so many options on a retirement savings plan menu that it's hard to know what to choose. But selecting good investments is only one part: Investors should also pay attention to overall portfolio diversification and not take on too much risk by being too heavily concentrated in any one area.How the investments correlate with one another is another consideration. Modern portfolio theory says that investors can maximize their return potential and reduce the risk of losses by combining investments in asset classes that are not perfectly correlated with one another. A combination of investments like this is likely to do reasonably well in a variety of environments, because as one asset is falling, another is likely rising. Once an optimal asset allocation is established, it's often advisable to rebalance back to the target allocations every so often and to reduce exposure to risky assets like stocks and stock funds as retirement approaches. Whereas early on investors are focused on growing their wealth, as they approach retirement the focus shifts to preserving it.These tasks are not impossible; certainly many investors manage their own portfolios and do it quite well. But there are a great many savers who would prefer to outsource the tasks of portfolio assembly, rebalancing, and gradually making their asset allocation more conservative. That's where target-date funds come in: They do all this for you.What Is a Target-Date Fund? A target-date fund is made up of other funds. The underlying funds offer diversified exposure to a mix of asset classes such as stocks (large caps as well as small\/mid-caps), foreign stocks, bonds, foreign bonds, and maybe a small portion of cashlike securities. They are designed to be held throughout a person's lifetime, and the asset mix shifts dynamically, becoming less risky over a person's working career and into retirement. These funds achieve this by rebalancing portfolios over time to become less focused on growth (lowering their allocation to stocks) and more focused on preservation (raising their allocation to bonds) as the fund approaches and passes the target date. (The year in the fund's name corresponds approximately to the investor's retirement date.) Target-date funds have become very popular: Investors had more than $3 trillion in target-date strategies by the end of 2021. One reason is that the Department of Labor's Pension Protection Act of 2006 designated these funds as a Qualified Default Investment Alternative within 401(k) retirement plans, which are investment vehicles into which plan sponsors are allowed to place participants who do not make their own investment election.But their popularity also owes to their relative ease of ownership--they are truly hands-off investments that offer a diversified portfolio of building blocks with professionally managed allocations and automatic adjustments.What to Look For Although you may be limited by your plan choices, there are many characteristics that Morningstar pays attention to when we evaluate target-date funds. Here are some things to look for. Low fees Unlike buying a luxury car, paying a high price for an investment doesn't guarantee you a better ride. It's important to pay attention to the overall cost of the target-date fund. Some providers layer on fees, and the resulting price tag represents not only the blended costs of the underlying funds but also a layer of management fees that the advisor charges to implement the asset-allocation glide path. Look for low fees. (Note that the funds that are closer to their target retirement date will tend to be less expensive overall than later-dated options because their asset mix starts to tilt away from higher-priced equity fare and toward lower-priced fixed-income options.)For instance, Silver-rated Vanguard Target Retirement Series charges just 0.08%. The portfolio is made up of low-cost index funds, and Vanguard does not charge a management fee to handle the dynamic asset-allocation piece for investors. Also, target-date funds built around index funds tend to be cheaper than those built around actively managed funds. According to Morningstar's target-date landscape report, the average asset-weighted expense ratio for target-date funds was 0.34% at the end of 2021.Asset mix that suits risk tolerance Some target-date funds invest more aggressively than others. Funds in the BlackRock LifePath Index series have an equity allocation approaching 97% for investors targeting retirement around 2060, while JPMorgan SmartRetirement has an equity stake of 85%--nearly 12 percentage points lower--for its similarly dated fund.Investors can also drill down to the underlying exposure to foreign stocks (maybe your risk tolerance doesn't jibe with having a big stake in emerging markets, for instance) or fixed income (perhaps you would prefer to avoid high-yield bonds).Check out the Portfolio tab on Morningstar.com's fund quote pages. There you will find statistics about the fund's portfolio.A glide path that makes sense The rate at which a target-date fund adjusts its allocations to stocks and fixed income over time is known as its glide path. Check to see how the fund invests over time and ramps down its equity exposure as retirement nears. Some invest more heavily in stocks throughout the life of the fund in the belief that a higher equity position--and the higher returns that typically come along with stocks--is necessary to ensure that investors don't outlive their savings.Morningstar analysts can help you evaluate a fund's glide path and allocation. The Fund Analysis section contains a thorough evaluation of the fund's merits and drawbacks and our analysts' overall rating. (The Fund Analysis section and Morningstar Analyst Rating are features of Premium Membership. You can sign up here for a free trial.)The Fund Analysis is divided into six sections. Each analysis begins with a Summary, in which the analyst provides a summary of their overall opinion, which often discusses the most important or decisive factors leading to the fund's overall rating. In the sections that follow, the analyst provides an evaluation of how well a fund scores in three fundamental areas (or Pillars): Process, People, and Parent. A fund's overall rating is heavily influenced by the qualitative scores our analysts assign to these three pillars.One-Size-Fits-Most For many investors, target-date funds make a lot of sense, but they may not work for everyone. Outside of initially picking the fund, they don't offer investors control over their investment or allocation choices. Also, by choosing a target-date vehicle, investors are limited to a given fund family's funds; most target-date funds use their own underlying funds to build portfolios. The drawback of that is that few fund companies offer best-of-breed funds across all asset classes.In addition, they are intended to be used on their own. If satellite holdings are added--perhaps to add exposure to market sectors not represented in the target-date fund's portfolio--investors must take on part of the rebalancing task by recalculating the asset allocation of the entire retirement portfolio to make sure it's in line with targets. (Morningstar.com's Portfolio Instant X-Ray tool can help.)Those caveats aside, target-date funds offer a great proposition for most retirement savers. They are no doubt the easiest path to setting up a diversified portfolio and maintaining a sensible asset allocation for decades.","Article Anthor":"Karen Wallace","Article Date":1646956800000}
{"Article Title":" What Is an Exchange-Traded Fund?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/952709\/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund","Article Content":"Editor's note: This article originally ran on Nov. 19, 2020. It\u2019s since been updated to reflect new data.ETFs (or exchange-traded funds) are hybrid investment vehicles that can offer relatively low-cost and tax-efficient exposure to a variety of asset classes and investment strategies. Like traditional mutual funds, most ETFs invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs trade on a stock exchange.The majority of ETFs are passively managed, which means they track an index. That said, a growing minority of them are actively managed. Irrespective of whether they are tracking an index or delivering an active strategy, ETFs tend to have lower annual expenses relative to mutual funds. That said, because they trade like stocks, investors should account for transaction costs (commissions, bid-ask spreads, and so on). ETFs are often lauded for their tax efficiency compared with traditional mutual funds. There are two main reasons ETFs are often more tax-efficient. First, most ETFs are index funds. And index funds, especially large-cap index funds or total-market index funds that are weighted by market cap, have fairly low turnover. Low turnover means fewer opportunities to realize gains when securities are sold from the portfolio. ETFs' structure is the second, more important driver of their tax efficiency. ETF shares are created and destroyed via in-kind transactions between ETFs' sponsors and a special kind of market maker known as an authorized participant. As such, ETFs tend not to have to directly sell positions from their portfolios to meet redemptions, which protects investors from taxable capital gains distributions.Investors should be aware that tax-efficient doesn't mean tax-free, though. The primary benefit of ETFs from a tax perspective is that they can allow investors to defer the realization of capital gains taxes. Investors in ETFs will still pay taxes on regular distributions of income, and they will also pay capital gains taxes when they sell an ETF for more than they paid for it. Also, some ETFs will distribute capital gains, though they tend to be less frequent and of lesser magnitude than those their mutual fund counterparts generate.How to Find the Best ETFs Morningstar Analyst Ratings can help you identify topnotch ETFs in nearly every asset class. Our analysts carefully evaluate exchange-traded funds, paying particular attention to the fund's process; they tend to favor ETFs that are very broadly diversified, low-cost, and sponsored by solid parent firms. The ETFs that attract the most investor dollars tend to be in \"core\" categories such as large-cap equity, foreign large-cap equity, and intermediate-term core bond, which are often used as the main building blocks of investors' portfolios. Encouragingly, many of the 10 largest ETFs by net assets are among those rated highly by Morningstar analysts for their broad diversification, low fees, and demonstrated ability to efficiently track a well-constructed index.     We assign positive (Morningstar Medalist) ratings to ETFs that we believe can outperform the median fund in the Morningstar Category, after fees. The ETFs we expect to outperform by the widest margin are rated Gold; our next-highest conviction picks are rated Silver, followed by Bronze.We hold ETFs that fall under the heading of strategic- or smart-beta to a different (higher) standard. At Morningstar, we think of strategic-beta ETFs as index funds that make active bets: They are linked to indexes that focus on one or more factors--such as value, momentum, or low volatility, in an effort to improve their returns or alter their risk profiles relative to traditional market benchmarks. Because of this, we require strategic-beta funds to surpass a tougher hurdle: They need to convince us they can beat the category index after fees (not the median fund in the category). Our assessment of process is the most important consideration behind the rating for these funds.We also assign Analyst Ratings to a number of actively managed ETFs. We put these funds through the same paces as we do actively managed mutual funds, while paying close attention to how the potential constraints of delivering an active strategy in the ETF format might affect the management team's process.
