{"Article Title":"529 Plans: What\u2019s Changed and What\u2019s the Same?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/personal-finance\/themes-across-529-plan-landscape-6-charts","Article Content":"Since their launch more than 20 years ago, 529 college savings plans have helped students and their families better access higher education through tax-advantaged investing. In this annual industry review, we discuss key themes across the 529 college savings plan landscape, including education inflation, asset growth, declining fees, and more.Backdrop\u2014Education Inflation Is Back on the RiseFor most of the past two decades, the cost of education rose more quickly than the general inflation rate, with the Consumer Price Index growing at 2.5% annually while the Tuition Index grew at 4%. Although this trend reversed in 2020 and has remained so since, it does not mean that education inflation has subsided. Rather, education inflation just briefly paled in comparison to the general price index as the world dealt with some extraordinary issues over the past few years. In fact, rolling 12-month inflation data shows that education inflation is on the rise again, easily surpassing 3% in March 2023. Continually rising tuition costs underpin the importance for families to save early and frequently within a 529\u2032s tax-advantaged structure; the additional time helps harness the effects of compounding to keep up with these increasing costs.\n\t\t\tGrowth of CPI vs. Tuition (Indexed)\n\t\t \n\t\t\tGrowth of CPI vs. Tuition (Indexed) over the past 20 years ended in April 2023.\n\t\t     Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Data as of 05\/30\/2023. 529 Industry Assets Fall in 2022In 2022, we saw a sizable decline in total 529 plan assets, the largest over the past decade, which had been a steady period for growth. Assets in 529 plans decreased by nearly 17% in 2022, dropping to $385 billion by year-end from $461 billion. Hardly any plan was immune to the market decline, with a vast majority of plans experiencing a decrease in total assets; the median loss was 14%. Direct-sold plans, which tend to carry lower fees and have grown faster than advisor-sold plans over the past decade, lost 15.8% on average. On the other hand, an average advisor-sold plan lost 20% of its assets in 2022.\n\t\t\tAssets Under Management by Distribution Channel\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA time series chart showing assets under management by distribution channel.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct, surveyed data, and author\u2019s calculations. Data as of 12\/31\/2022. Glide Paths Have Become Smoother; Plans Pause on Taking Additional Equity RiskMost 529 accountholders utilize an age-based or target-enrollment strategy, which is a set-it-and-forget-it type of investment that starts with a large allocation in risky assets (that is, equities) when the beneficiary is young. As the beneficiary grows older, the portfolio transitions to a more conservative positioning by allocating more to bonds and cash or cashlike accounts. A glide path shows how an age-based or target-enrollment series\u2019 allocation shifts to a more conservative positioning as the beneficiary grows closer to college enrollment. Over the years, Morningstar has cautioned investors against glide paths with large equity steps (21% or more), as they expose investors to market-timing risk. If a portfolio happens to derisk after a large market decline, investors risk locking in their losses and capping their upside by selling stocks at their low and allocating those funds to bonds and cash.In recent years, many plan providers have improved their series by adopting a smoother glide path, and 2022 was no exception. Several plans have adopted a progressive glide path, which makes small (around 2%) asset-allocation changes, typically four times a year. Others have added portfolios to their age-based series so that the equity step-downs (which take place in one day) are 12.5% or less. By the end of 2022, close to 80% of all plans featured equity steps of 10% or less, while series with large step-downs accounted for less than 3% of the industry.\n\t\t\tPercentage of Series by Greatest Equity Step\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA chart showing the percentage of total available age-based\/target-enrollment series by their greatest equity step-downs.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\/31\/2022 The chart below shows the average equity allocation of 166 age-based or target-enrollment series, divided into five groups. The first group, progressive, includes 60 series that typically follow one glide path but may provide choice. For example, plans managed by Fidelity, such as Massachusetts\u2019 U.Fund College Investing Plan, which has a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Bronze, employ one progressive glide path but provide a choice of three series: one that uses all active underlying funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a blend of active and index funds. This group saw several new entrants, including Idaho\u2019s Vanguard Target Enrollment series and Arkansas\u2019 Bright Future Target Enrollment series, launched in April and September 2022, respectively. These new plans harbor varying risk appetites along the glide path. On average, however, there were not any notable changes in the equity allocation.\n\t\t\tAverage Glide Paths for Progressive and Age-Based Series\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA graph showing average glide paths for age-based and target-enrollment series.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\/31\/2022 The remaining four groups follow an age-based stepped glide path. There are 25 plans that offer one glide path option, depicted as \u201cage-based: one option.\u201d This group saw a roughly 2% increase in equity allocation across the glide path. Other plans allow investors to pick their preferred risk profile by providing aggressive, moderate, and conservative options. These \u201ctarget-risk\u201d glide paths saw little increase in equity allocation; in fact, the equity stakes decreased in some parts of the glide path. Fees Continue to FallAverage fees continue to fall across the investment industry, including 529 savings plans. By the end of 2022, the average fee for an age-based or target-enrollment series was 0.46%, a 2-basis-point decline from the year before. Direct-sold plans maintained their fee advantage and slashed another 3 basis points, arriving at an average fee of 0.31%. Advisor-sold plans remained significantly more expensive, with an average fee of 0.83% after a basis-point decline in 2022.\n\t\t\tAverage Total Expense Ratios of Age-Based and Target Enrollment Series\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA chart showing the time-series data for average total expense ratios of age-based\/target-enrollment series.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 05\/30\/2022 Fee reductions can come from multiple sources. A switch to cheaper (often passive) underlying funds is one way. For example, Bronze-rated Florida 529 Savings Plan switched to index funds in the target enrollment series in 2022 and became the cheapest plan in the industry. Illinois\u2019 Bronze-rated Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 plan also added an all-passive track in November 2022 that features Vanguard and iShares index funds, offering a cheaper option to its investors. Other plans have trimmed their state fees and\/or negotiated with their program manager for lower fees. Plans with a growing and relatively larger asset base can achieve some economies of scale, which can be passed on to investors through lower fees. For instance, Silver-rated Oregon College Savings Plan met its $2.5 billion breakpoint in 2022, resulting in a slight reduction to its asset-based fees. Moreover, as the team saw stable asset growth, it cut its administrative fee by 5 basis points.\n\t\t\tAge-Based and Target-Enrollment Series Fees by Distribution and Allocation in Active Funds\n\t\t \n\t\t\tA scatterplot showing the distribution of age-based and target-enrollment series' allocation to active funds and their average total expense ratio.\n\t\t     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 12\/31\/2022 Advisor-sold plans remain more expensive on average than direct-sold plans, partially because of their higher allocation to actively managed strategies (see chart above). While holding actively managed strategies itself is not a flaw, investors need to ensure that the fees do not eat into their investment returns. For instance, New Hampshire\u2019s Fidelity Advisor 529 Plan earns a High People rating thanks to its impressive lineup of active managers. However, a hefty price tag that ranges from 0.67% to 1.85% keeps its rating at Neutral.Having said that, advisor-sold plans can hold index funds and still be expensive because of sales and distribution fees paid to the advisor. For instance, Maine offers an advisor-sold series that only holds low-cost index funds. The weighted average fee for the underlying index funds is just 8-10 basis points, but after adding program management, administrative, and distribution fees, the average total expense ratio ranges from 0.57% to 1.37%.As the Price Pillar accounts for 30% of the Morningstar Medalist Rating for 529 plans, there are very few advisor-sold plans that earn a Bronze rating or higher. As of June 2023, only three such plans exist: Illinois Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 Plan, Ohio\u2019s BlackRock CollegeAdvantage, and Virginia\u2019s CollegeAmerica. All three earn Above Average or High ratings in all pillars besides Price, reflecting a well-thought-out process, high-caliber investment personnel, and\/or exemplary oversight. Morningstar doesn\u2019t prefer active or passive funds for age-based or target-enrollment series. In fact, we recognize promising 529 plans offering series across the active-passive spectrum. However, our research has consistently shown that, over time, lower-fee options provide a reliable edge relative to peers. Lower fees present lower performance hurdles, putting less pressure on portfolio managers to take more risk to make up their funds\u2019 costs. It\u2019s hard even for outstanding asset allocation and talented managers to consistently overcome high costs, especially when their styles are out of favor. Low fees, however, are a dependable advantage that compounds over time and can lead to better investor outcomes.","Article Anthor":"Hyunmin Kim","Article Date":1686528000000}
{"Article Title":"2 Top-Rated 529 Plans","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/personal-finance\/2-top-rated-529-plans","Article Content":"Morningstar currently rates 54 529 plans, representing 93% of the assets in the industry. Of those 54, two receive our top mark of Gold, reflecting our highest confidence in the plans\u2019 ability to provide participants with compelling investment results.While these two plans may not be the best options for everyone (once personal preferences or tax situations come into the picture), they serve as examples of what is possible in a 529 plan, and it behooves diligent investors to take note.Why? Because best-in-class standards help an investor shape expectations and make a selection, even as applied to a subset of 529 options best suited to their personal profiles. Below, we discuss some of the features that distinguish the two Gold-rated plans from their peers. Before We Start: Applying Morningstar\u2019s Medalist Rating to 529 PlansMorningstar\u2019s Medalist Rating for 529 plans considers four supporting pillars:PeopleProcessParentPriceFor each pillar, we look for what we believe are best-in-class industry practices, including:Skilled investment teams with experience managing multi-asset strategies;A well-researched asset-allocation approach;A robust process for selecting investments and managing risk;The state agency\u2019s ability to provide thoughtful oversight and stewardship; andLower fees relative to Morningstar Category peers in age-based or target-enrollment options.The pillar scores are then rolled up to arrive at a Morningstar Medalist Rating, which reflects our analysts\u2019 confidence in each plan\u2019s ability to offer a compelling risk-adjusted performance relative to peers.First-Rate Plans: Michigan and UtahAs of May 2023, the two plans that hold Morningstar Medalist Ratings of Gold are the Michigan Education Savings Program and Utah\u2019s my529. Each offers a well-designed age-based or target-enrollment series, which are set-it-and-forget-it investment options that gradually derisk during the accumulation and savings period. They also employ a solid menu of static options of mutual funds and\/or exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to individual asset classes and a safe vehicle to park cash, such as an FDIC-insured savings account.\n\t\t\tTwo Top-Rated 529 Plans\n\t\t      Utah: Customization for Experienced InvestorsUtah\u2019s my529 has consistently been one of our favorite offerings, setting industry standards on many fronts and currently differentiating itself from peers with customization capabilities.The series employs a progressive glide path, which starts with a 100% allocation to equities and falls to 17% by enrollment. This gradual shift is an industry best practice, as it helps education savers avoid the risk of meaningfully shifting out of equities just after a market dip, when there is the potential to lock in losses. The underlying lineup using Vanguard index funds provides broad market exposure at a low cost. This design earns it an Above Average Process rating. The fees for these portfolios are low, at 0.14%-0.15%. The team behind my529 boasts topnotch resources, underpinning a High People rating. Instead of hiring an investment manager for the plan, the state employs its own well-resourced and experienced investment team. A dedicated group of roughly 75 professionals handles everything from portfolio management to recordkeeping. The team also receives support from an investment advisory committee and multiple independent consultants. These additional resources and insights provide an edge compared with the typical 529 peer. We rate the state parent as High because its centralized oversight structure allows for engaged stewardship of the plan, and the state has earnestly continued to reduce fees.One distinctive feature that only the Utah plan offers is the ability to create a custom series in which investors design their own glide path and select the underlying investments. The investment menu includes 22 options, such as Vanguard index funds and DFA funds that cover broad asset classes, style and size, and strategies with a sustainable investment focus. Given the degree of customization for this option, it is suitable for experienced investors or those who work with an investment advisor.Michigan: Low Cost, Easy to UseMichigan Education Savings Program offers an easy-to-use, straightforward series with extremely low average fees of 0.10%. Michigan also employs a progressive glide path, but one slightly flatter than Utah\u2019s, as it starts with an 80% equity allocation and lands at 20% by college enrollment. (This can result in some performance differences depending on the market environment.)This shape is influenced by the historical average age of the beneficiary when the account opens. This prudent approach aids investors who may have delayed saving for education expenses and supports a High Process rating. The enrollment-date portfolios hold mostly index funds, with a slightly more diversified lineup relative to Utah, as it also includes REITs, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and high-yield bonds.This plan was designed via an effective collaboration between the Michigan Bureau of Investments and its dedicated program manager TIAA, driving its Above Average People rating. Michigan, with its investment staff, conducts in-house research and taps participant studies to make informed investment decisions on behalf of beneficiaries. For instance, the state worked closely with TIAA to design the target enrollment glide path that came into effect in 2020. It also pushed for improvements in the underlying lineup, resulting in an offering that includes highly rated Vanguard, iShares, Schwab, and TIAA funds. This move also resulted in lower fees for the series, and the plan continues to be among the cheapest in the industry. Their dedication to shaping a simple, low-cost plan around their participants\u2019 evolving needs also supports a High Parent rating.ConclusionThe two Gold-rated 529 plans differ on some fronts, but they share the key characteristics of being excellent stewards of capital for the end investors. Namely: a skilled investment team, a robust investment and oversight process, reasonably low fees, and more. While these plans exemplify many of what Morningstar considers as best practices, there are many other plans we rate that investors can explore. Depending on personal circumstances and preferences, a thoughtful investor can still settle on a different plan.

{"Article Title":"Morningstar 529 Ratings: The Top Plans and What They Offer","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1122373\/morningstar-529-ratings-the-top-plans-and-what-they-offer","Article Content":"Morningstar\u2019s team of manager research analysts annually assigns forward-looking, qualitative ratings to a subset of the 529 college savings plan universe based on our assessment of each plan\u2019s investment merits relative to its peers.Just as 529 education savings assets hit $386 billion in August 2022, our analysts began reviewing 54 plans that represented 93% of those assets.Using a 529 college savings plan when saving for future education expenses can be an attractive option, as investments in the plan grow tax-free. You can learn more about 529 college savings plans and how to start saving in our 529 guide. Movers and Shakers in Our 529 RatingsAt the overall plan level, 529 ratings moves were modest\u2014two downgrades and six upgrades\u2014with a few notable themes across the underlying pillars. Vanguard-managed plans that employ an age-based structure experienced Process rating downgrades to Average, as these offerings now feature less attractive traits, such as an aggressive track that has above average duration risk in and near enrollment, and conservative and moderate tracks that derisk relatively early, meaning investors are less likely to keep pace with the rising costs of higher education. Stewardship standards for each state, as reflected in the Parent rating, continue to rise, with elements such as evidence of robust interaction between the state and its investment entity set as a baseline; two states were upgraded and two downgraded within this context. And in good news for 529 investors, fees continue to inch downward. The average fee as of our 2022 review fell to 0.45% from 0.48% in 2021 (prior to 2022, the average fee was calculated across only plans under coverage, but the average fee calculation now includes all 529 plans, regardless of coverage, and provides a more representative context for industry trends). Many plans continue to employ index funds and exchange-traded funds, when possible, improving cost efficiency for investors.In 2022, 34 plans received a recommended rating in the form of Gold, Silver, or Bronze. Morningstar Medalist plans offer investment options that should outperform and exhibit some combination of the following attractive features:A well-researched asset-allocation approachA robust process for selecting underlying investmentsA well-resourced and experienced investment teamStrong, stable, and engaged oversight from the stateLow feesInvestors in these medalist 529 plans should be well-positioned for the future.The remaining 20 plans with Morningstar Analyst Ratings are Neutral or Negative and are dominated by advisor-sold plans, whose high fees detract from their overall ratings. Of the 16 Neutral-rated plans, 11 are advisor-sold, six of which carry Above Average Process ratings, indicating these plans offer well-designed investment options. The compounding impact of high fees, however, can hinder performance and the total amount saved over the long term. Negative-rated plans may exhibit a subpar asset-allocation approach, an unattractive lineup of underlying funds, and\/or high fees that reduce the odds of investor success. Many states offer income tax benefits to 529 participants who invest in their home state\u2019s plan, but these benefits vary widely. Some are generous, offering tax credits on low contributions. For other states, the tax benefit is dependent on the contributors\u2019 marginal state income tax rate and state deduction limits. Morningstar does not factor state tax benefits into its ratings, but 529 plan participants can consider the potential tax benefits of investing in their state\u2019s plan, along with our ratings, as part of their decision-making process.Gold 529 Ratings: Industry Standard SettersIn 2022, two plans merit Analyst Ratings of Gold. The excellent stewardship of the state Parents of the Michigan Education Savings Program and Utah\u2019s my529 result in well-designed, low-cost offerings.     In 2020, the Michigan plan moved to a target enrollment structure, in which participants see a gradual shift to bonds from stocks; this mitigates the risk that comes with equity step-downs during volatile markets (age-based series make larger, more infrequent step-downs). To plan this transition, the treasurer\u2019s office worked closely with its investment manager TIAA-CREF to design the glide path to benefit the average beneficiary in this plan, who typically starts saving at around 5 years old. At the same time, the state pushed for improvements in the underlying lineup and now the plan features highly rated Vanguard, iShares, Schwab, and TIAA-CREF funds. This move also resulted in lower fees for the series, and the plan continues to be among the cheapest in the industry.Utah\u2019s my529 plan is the only plan that has received a Gold medal every year since we debuted our ratings in 2012. Utah moved from an age-based to a target enrollment structure in 2021, and it incorporated insights from participant data and asset-allocation research into this new glide-path design, benefiting set-it-and-forget-it savers. The plan also continues to offer its unique, custom age-based portfolios that allow investors to build their own glide paths using Vanguard and DFA funds. State oversight continues to be topnotch. Instead of hiring an investment manager for the plan, the state employs its own well-resourced and experienced investment team and draws upon a network of experts, including its board, an investment advisory committee comprising institutional investors and advisors, and consultants. Silver 529 Ratings: Standard CarriersAlmost all of the Silver-rated plans have an Above Average or High rating for both People and Process. This indicates that a highly regarded investment team employs a rigorous process regarding glide-path design, asset allocation, manager selection, and risk management to create an offering that is suitable for 529 beneficiaries.There are two new Silver-rated plans this year. Illinois\u2019 Bright Start Direct-Sold College Savings was downgraded to Silver from Gold because of recent turnover in the state treasurer\u2019s office, and the Wisconsin Edvest 529 Plan was upgraded to Silver from Bronze following improvements to the target enrollment lineup and fee cuts.     Bright Start\u2019s partnership between the Illinois treasurer office\u2019s investment professionals and investment advisor Wilshire has long been a source of strength. The state actively manages its age-based series with regular small adjustments to the underlying fund lineup. One ongoing trend is the effort to gradually shift to passive from active funds in more efficient asset classes. In 2021, the state\u2019s director of investment analysis and due diligence was promoted to chief investment officer, and later that year, his sole team member\u2014and replacement\u2014departed. The CIO now works with an interim director (as of August 2022) and a new analyst hired in late 2021 who is new to the industry. These changes lowered the plan\u2019s People rating to Above Average from High and caused an overall downgrade to Silver. Overall, this plan is still a strong option, offering three risk-based tracks, available with either very low-cost index funds or a strong mix of active and passive strategies composed of many Morningstar Medalists.In May 2022, Wisconsin improved its target enrollment series\u2019 underlying fund lineup, swapping in three highly rated Vanguard funds and removing three actively managed TIAA-CREF funds. This change, along with newly negotiated program manager fee cuts, resulted in a large 30% average fee reduction and a Price Pillar upgrade. Wisconsin\u2019s open-architecture approach has become more like those of the Silver-rated direct-sold plans that TIAA-CREF manages for California, Georgia, and Minnesota. As such, we have upgraded this Wisconsin plan to Silver.The Vanguard 529 College Savings Plan, Pennsylvania 529 Investment Plan, and Ohio\u2019s CollegeAdvantage 529 Savings Plan also earn Silvers. Vanguard is the investment manager for these plans, all of which have adopted Vanguard\u2019s new target enrollment structure. MOST Missouri\u2019s 529 Education Plan has not adopted the target enrollment structure but retains its Silver rating because of strong state Parent stewardship and recent fee reductions.Other Silver ratings include plans (offered by Alaska and Maryland) run by a topnotch team at T. Rowe Price. These are favorites among all-active target enrollment series. Silver-rated Oregon College Savings Plan distinguishes itself with a target enrollment series that features a portfolio for every year (most plans offer portfolios every two or three years).Bronze 529 Ratings: Meeting and Sometimes Exceeding StandardsBronze-rated plans tend to have a mix of Average to Above Average ratings across the People, Process, Parent, and Price Pillars. They can still help investors meet their goals, but the range of outcomes is wider than those of Silver- or Gold-rated rivals.     Four plans were upgraded to Bronze from Neutral in 2022. Indiana\u2019s CollegeChoice 529 Direct Savings Plan earned a Process upgrade by improving the diversification of its target enrollment series\u2019 by increasing its exposure to non-U.S. stocks to 35% within the equity sleeve (from 25%) and adding a real estate fund. Other improvements included removing a credit-sensitive bond strategy and dropping average fees by 25%.Fee cuts also elevated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan and Illinois\u2019 Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 College Savings Program to Bronze from Neutral. Iowa trimmed its program management fee this year, making it among the industry\u2019s cheapest. Illinois\u2019 Bright Directions\u2019 average fees for its age-based series are the lowest among advisor-sold plans. In November 2022, the plan will launch a lower-cost index-based series, which will further reduce average fees.Nebraska\u2019s Bloomwell 529 Education Savings Plan earned an upgrade because of increased confidence in its offering, which features two options: a core low-cost index fund track and a socially aware track whose underlying holdings include Morningstar Medalist iShares ESG equity funds and a high-quality bond sleeve.Vanguard plans that continue to use the age-based structure instead of the newer target enrollment structure all saw Process rating downgrades to Average from Above Average. These include North Carolina\u2019s National College Savings Program, MOST Missouri\u2019s 529 Education Plan, Colorado\u2019s CollegeInvest Direct Portfolio College Savings Plan, and New York\u2019s 529 Program (Direct). North Carolina\u2019s and Colorado\u2019s overall ratings remained Bronze, but New York\u2019s fell to Bronze from Silver and Missouri retained its Silver. Vanguard\u2019s age-based offerings have outdated traits such as above-average duration risk in the aggressive track and overly conservative moderate and conservative tracks that remove equity exposure by 17 and 13 years old, respectively.Neutral 529 Ratings: Industry StandardThe list of Neutrals remained consistent. It includes many advisor-sold plans whose layers of fees offset their Above Average Process ratings. New Mexico\u2019s Scholar\u2019s Edge has made adjustments that bring it more in line with evolving industry standards, prompting an upgrade of its rating to Neutral from Negative.     Negative 529 Ratings: Below StandardSeven plans earned Negative ratings in 2021. Four of them stayed Negative in 2022, New Mexico\u2019s Scholar\u2019s Edge moved to Neutral, and two plans were dropped from coverage: Nevada\u2019s SSgA UPromise 529 Plan and USAA 529 Education Savings Plan.     There were some pillar changes among the Negatives. College Access 529 Plan saw a People downgrade to Below Average, as a new firm with fewer resources took over. Virtus provided a home for three members of the team after the SEC disqualified their previous employer Allianz Global Investors from providing advisory services to U.S.-registered funds effective July 2022. This transition hollowed out the plan\u2019s investment team, as it lost access to Allianz\u2019s 80-person global multi-asset outfit.For New Jersey, recent improvements to its direct and advisor-sold age-based series\u2019 underlying fund lineups drove a Parent rating upgrade to Below Average from Low. The new fund lineup also features lower cost strategies, improving New Jersey\u2019s Franklin Templeton 529 College Savings Plan\u2019s Price rating to Above Average from High.Morningstar Analyst Rating InputsWe began rating 529 education savings plans in 2012. Over that period, these tax-advantaged investment options have gained popularity, as assets climbed from $167 billion to over $386 billion as of August 2022. The 529 industry continues to evolve, and in July 2020, we rolled out an enhanced rating methodology, reflecting our updated views on what an industry-standard plan looks like and what aspects of a plan warrant our highest conviction. We evaluate plans based on four key pillars: Process, People, Parent, and Price. Pillar-level research informs our holistic view of plans and results in the Morningstar Analyst Rating for 529 plans.The 2022 ratings (54 plans covered) featured a total of eight upgrades or downgrades, compared with 11 in 2021 (62 plans covered) and 27 in 2020 (61 plans covered). The implementation of our enhanced ratings methodology in 2020 sparked an increased number of upgrades and downgrades compared with prior years, but with this rubric well-exercised for a third year running, our forward-looking ratings were within expectations.","Article Anthor":"Patricia Oey","Article Date":1667347200000}

Morningstar director of personal finance and retirement planning Christine Benz has put together a monthly financial to-do list for 2022, and October's to-do is all about how to save for college.Christine, thanks for being here. Good to see you.Christine Benz: Good to see you, Susan. Key TakeawaysFinding balance is key. It's important to balance college savings alongside other important financial goals, retirement savings being the main one.If you go with your home state's 529 plan, you're typically able to earn a tax break on the contribution.Don't overcomplicate saving for college. Typically 529 plans offer age-based tracks, so you can select the plan that corresponds with your child's age, and those options are really hands-off.Overextending the parents' financial situation in an effort to pay for college is a big mistake that investors make.Dziubinski: One key challenge that many families face is, I have, you know, I want to send my kids to college. I want to save for college, but then I have these other goals like retirement. Any tips for how to think about balancing a variety of different goals when college is one of them.Benz: Balance, is really the keyword. Like so many things in life, it's important to balance college savings alongside other important financial goals, retirement savings being the main one. You have to put retirement savings in the front seat, because if you come up short with your retirement savings, you just simply have fewer levers than you do with college. And another thing I would say on the college front, I think parents might be put off by these incredibly high numbers we see in the realm of what college costs today. I was looking at in-state tuition at public universities--$9,000, $19,000 for out-of-state students at those public universities. Some elite public universities are charging well more than that. And of course private-school tuition has gone through the roof, too, where it's like $38,000 I believe is the average, and many elite private institutions are charging upward of $60,000.Don't be blinded by those really high numbers, recognize that for all but very, very wealthy families, college funding is probably going to come from a variety of sources. So, it might be your personal savings, that might be a component of it, but so might financial aid, so might loans, so might a healthy dose of compromise on the part of your student, and that might entail some work in college. When college comes close, you'll be able to look at the whole toolkit and recognize that for many households, aid, financial aid, merit-based aid will be a big piece of the puzzle. I would urge everyone to read Ron Lieber's great book on this topic. It's called The Price You Pay for College. Really great explainer of how merit-based aid works. Dziubinski: And in your podcast The Long View you actually interviewed Ron about this very topic about a year ago.Benz: We did, and he is a fount of wisdom on this topic of paying for college.Dziubinski: Now there are already different vehicles or tools that parents or family can use to help save for college. What do you recommend? What do you think is the best tool for folks to use. Benz: Well, I would say the basic, main receptacle that people should use is a 529 college savings plan. And there are a few key reasons to look at 529, the big one is tax breaks. So if you go with your home state's plan, you're typically able to earn a tax break on the contribution. As long as the money stays within the 529 plan, you're able to enjoy tax-deferred compounding on your money. And then when the money comes out to pay for college, assuming it's going for qualified college expenses, those withdrawals are also tax-free. You get some nice tax breaks for using a 529 plan. The other big advantage is that for super savers especially, you can get a lot of funds into a 529 plan and there aren't any income limits that would clamp down on how much you can put in there. So, some nice tax benefits and also just a lot of flexibility built in.Dziubinski: How would an investor have a sense of what they should be looking for when they're choosing a 529 plan?Benz: I would say the starting point is to look at your home state's 529 plan. But I would also urge people to take a look at our College Savings Center on Morningstar.com. We've got a map where you can dial in and look at your home state. See what sort of plan is on offer. Our team does these great annual ratings of 529 plans. I believe the next round of ratings is coming out in November. But it's a really nice distillation of how various plans stack up from the standpoint of investment options and fees. And I'm happy to say when we look at the data since we've been covering 529 plans and certainly other entities have been shining a light on this space as well. We've seen fees come down. We've seen investment lineups improve. It's, I think, a fact of life that transparency, shining a light in this space has really helped improve the plans.Dziubinski: And let's talk a little bit about investing those 529 plan assets and the investment choices that you have within a 529 plan. What's your advice there?Benz: My advice is to not overcomplicate this. So, typically 529 plans do offer age-based tracks so you can select the plan that sort of corresponds with your child's age. And the nice thing about that is that those options are really hands-off. So as your child gets closer to college, the plans will typically take risk off the table. And the nice thing is we've seen 529 plans, the age-based plans, really get religion about the importance of becoming more conservative as that matriculation date draws close. We saw some plans get into trouble during the great financial crisis, more plans have cleaned up their act. So, we're seeing more of these age-based plans really sort of being in sync in terms of being thoroughly derisked at the time that college is upon your child.Dziubinski: Lastly Christine, what are some common mistakes that families make when they're saving for college? What are some things that they should try to avoid doing?Benz: I think a big one is overextending the parents' financial situation in an effort to pay for college. I truly get it. I get where parents are coming from in terms of wanting to raid their own coffers to try to make college work. But generally speaking, if you're having to reach into your own Roth IRA or take a home equity loan or take what's called a Parent PLUS loan, which is basically a loan in your own name to pay for your child's education. Those are probably red flags that you are putting your own financial life at jeopardy. I think that's a big risk factor for parents.Dziubinski: Well, Christine, thank you for your time today. It's a really overwhelming topic for parents.Benz: You know.Dziubinski: I know, having just sent our children to college.Benz: Right.Dziubinski: We really appreciate your time and your tips when it comes to this.Benz:Thank you so much, Susan.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

{"Article Title":" Do 529 Plans Have Contribution Limits?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1094567\/do-529-plans-have-contribution-limits","Article Content":"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. 529 education savings plans are popular choices for investing for college. Here with me to discuss some of the contribution limits and tax considerations when investing in 529 plans is Patty Oey. She's a senior analyst with Morningstar's research team.Hi, Patty, nice to see you today.Patricia Oey: Hi, Susan, nice to see you, too. Dziubinski: So, let's start out with the elevator pitch for 529 education savings plans: What are they?Oey: Sure. These plans, what they have is they have a menu of investment options. Usually the default option is something that derisks over time. So if you invest when your child is young, the portfolio will be heavy in equities, and they'll trim the equities down as the time passes, so that when you get ready to spend the money, the equity allocation is lower so you don't see the portfolio value move so much just before you're about to spend it. Plans will also offer a menu of mutual funds and ETFs that you can also invest in, and then finally there is a place to park your cash. So it'll be like a stable value or an FDIC-insured account.Dziubinski: Now, who can invest in a 529 plan and for whom? Oey: Sure. Technically, anyone can open a 529 plan and name a beneficiary. Typically, it's the parents who open a 529 plan for their child, but certainly grandparents can do it. And then someone like me, I have six nieces and nephews\u2014I can open one for each of them as well. And then family friends. So really, anyone can open one as long as there is a beneficiary who's planning to go to school.Dziubinski: Now, can beneficiaries only have one 529 education plan?Oey: No. Again, going back, so I have two kids, so I can open one for each kid and then say, you know, they have their grandparents, two sets of grandparents, so each grandparent can open an account for that one son. Yes, one person can have more than one account. Dziubinski: Now, let's talk a little bit about annual contributions. Are there annual contribution limits when it comes to these plans? For instance, how much can one person invest in someone's 529 plan?Oey: Technically, there is no contribution limits, but putting money into a 529 account, it's considered a gift. So, it is technically subject to the gift tax exclusion. In 2022, that is $16,000. If you do go over, then it gets counted against your lifetime exclusion. That is $12 million. I guess technically, if you know later on that your estate is not going to be close to $12 million, there is no tax penalty for contributing more, but it is technically under the $16,000 limit per beneficiary, per donor. So I can give to my kid $16,000. My husband can also give to that same kid $16,000.Dziubinski: Got it. Now, of course, as you pointed out, more than one person can contribute to a beneficiary's 529 education savings plan. Are there limits in total to how much money can be in a given beneficiary's 529 plan?Oey: Say I have my son, and I have a plan for my son and my parents have a plan for him. The limit is per plan. And then generally, these plans are offered by different states, the states set the limit on how big the accounts can be. Roughly the maximum is equivalent to about a four-year education, tuition plus room and board. On the low end, some states, their maximum is closer to $300,000. On the higher end, it's probably like around $500,000 or more. It just depends on the state. But again, it's per account. For my account, say in our state, it's $500,000, I can max it out to $500,000. And then the plan that my parents open for my child, they can also max it out at $500,000, which is, you know, plenty of money.Dziubinski: Patty, is there a way that an account can be accidentally overfunded? Let's say there is that $500,000 limit in a given account? What prevents it from going over that amount? And if it does go over that amount, what happens?Oey: Yeah, good question. The plans, they have their cap. And so basically, if you hit that threshold, it will not accept more contributions. But certainly the market moves. So if the market continues to move up, they're not going to suddenly just shut down your account. They'll let the market ride and let that account ride. But yes, they will not accept any more contributions once you've hit the threshold.Dziubinski: Got it. And then just to wrap up, are there any other 529 plan contribution limits, tax considerations, anything that investors should be aware of if they're considering either opening a 529 plan or if they already have one that they're contributing to?Oey: Right. The key thing is that you put the money in the account, it grows, and if you spend the money on qualified expenses, you don't pay capital gains on the ... capital gains that you enjoyed in that account. So everyone is eligible for that benefit. At the state level, different states have their own rules regarding state tax benefits. Some states don't offer any tax benefits. Some states don't have state income taxes, so there's no benefit to offer. And then a whole bunch of other states offer different types of state tax benefit. And what that mainly is, is that you can deduct your contribution when you calculate your state income tax liability.Dziubinski: So before you make a decision, make sure you look at what state benefits you might be able to get from a tax perspective.Oey: Yes.Dziubinski: Sounds good. Well, Patty, thank you so much for walking us through some of these details with 529 plans. Again, they're very popular, are great ideas for saving for college and other educational expenses. But you've got to know the rules of the road. So, thank you.Oey: Thank you.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Thanks for tuning in.","Article Anthor":"Patricia Oey,  Susan Dziubinski","Article Date":1653004800000}
{"Article Title":" 5 Charts Tracking Recent 529 Savings Plan Trends    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1095648\/5-charts-tracking-recent-529-savings-plan-trends","Article Content":"The impetus for introducing 529 college savings plans over 20 years ago remains strong: to broaden accessibility to higher education through tax-advantaged investing. Since Morningstar assigned its first forward-looking Analyst Ratings to 529s in 2012, we've witnessed continuous improvements to these tax-advantaged investing plans, from the quality of the investment options to fee reductions.Assets in 529 plans increased by 17% in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $461 billion by year-end. Since 2011, assets have grown at a fairly steady clip, averaging about 13% a year (see Exhibit 1). Over that same period, growth in direct-sold plans, which tend to carry lower fees, averaged about 15% a year, versus 13% growth in the more expensive advisor-sold plans. Vanguard continues to maintain its lead within 529 plan investment options, holding an approximately 30% market share, followed by Capital Group at 20%. Far behind, but still material players include Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, T. Rowe Price, and Columbia Management, with market shares between 4% and 9%.     Glide Paths: An EvolutionThe 529 college savings plan was designed to be low maintenance and suitable for both novice and experienced investors. Each plan offers a menu of investment options, including aged-based or target-enrollment series, as well as individual mutual funds, and cash or cashlike accounts. The majority of 529 accountholders opt for the age-based or target-enrollment series because of their ease of use. When the beneficiary is young, the portfolio starts with a large allocation in equities, and then shifts to a more conservative positioning by trimming equities and moving into bonds and cash as the beneficiary approaches college age.In recent years, many plan providers have improved their series by adopting a smoother glide path. Some have switched to a progressive glide path, which makes small (around 2%) asset-allocation changes, typically four times a year. Others have added portfolios to their age-based series so that the equity step-downs (which take place in one day) are 12.5% or less. Larger equity steps of 20% or more expose investors to market-timing risk. These large shifts can weigh on returns if they were to take place as markets recover after a large decline. In 2016, over 40% of age-based series had at least one equity step of 21% or greater. By the end of March 2022, series with such large step-downs only accounted for 3% of the industry.     In 2020, a large group of plans moved to a progressive glide path. This included six managed by TIAA-CREF, such as the Gold-rated Michigan Education Savings Program and California's Silver-rated ScholarShare College Savings Plan. Another notable switch to progressive took place in Silver-rated The Vanguard 529 College Savings Plan, which did not go smoothly, as both state sponsor Nevada and Vanguard failed to notice errors in the asset allocation. The pace of change slowed in 2021, when only four plans moved from a stepped glide path to a progressive one: the Silver-rated Pennsylvania 529 Investment Plan, Utah's Gold-rated my529, Connecticut's Neutral-rated CHET Advisor 529 College Savings Plan, and Colorado's Neutral-rated Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan.In April 2021, Pennsylvania switched from offering three age-based series (conservative, moderate, and aggressive) to one target-enrollment option and kept the same underlying fund lineup. Utah's my529 made the change in July 2021, going from four age-based series to one target-enrollment option while also trimming the number of underlying funds. For both plans, the end of the glide path courts a little more risk than their prior conservative and moderate tracks. More specifically, the new progressive glide paths generally hold slightly higher equity allocations relative to the two plans' previous moderate options, and include an almost 20% equity allocation in the year prior to the target-enrollment year, whereas the prior conservative options had already moved to a zero allocation in equities. 529 investors who want to minimize downside risk just prior to enrollment should consider moving their assets into a cash or cashlike account.The remaining two plans that moved to a progressive glide path, Connecticut's CHET Advisor 529 College Savings Plan and Colorado's Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan, resulted from a change in program manager to Fidelity Investments and TIAA-CREF, respectively. Both firms employ progressive glide paths in the plans they manage for other states. Industry laggards, with steps of 21% or greater, include the Neutral-rated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan and three nonrated plans: Iowa's IAdvisor 529 Plan, Louisiana's START Saving Program, and Oregon's MFS 529 Savings Plan. Exhibit 3 shows the average equity allocations of 164 age-based or target-enrollment series, divided into five groups. The first group, progressive, includes 53 series. In this group, each plan typically follows one glide path but may provide choice. For example, plans managed by Fidelity, such as Massachusetts' Bronze-rated U.Fund College Investing Plan, employ one progressive glide path but provide a choice of three series: one that uses all active underlying funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a blend of active and index funds.The remaining four groups follow an age-based stepped glide path. There are 26 plans that offer one glide path option, depicted as \"age-based: one option.\" The remaining plans allow investors to pick their preferred risk profile by providing aggressive, moderate, and conservative options.     Plans that offer one glide path option (progressive and one option) have average equity allocations that are slightly higher than the average moderate glide path. While a higher equity allocation earlier in the glide path can potentially result in higher upside in the long run, investors will likely experience more volatility. That said, in 2020, during and immediately after the pandemic-related market slide, 529 investors appeared to stay put, suggesting that investors can weather volatility without panicking. But a large decline in 529 assets for those just about to enter college can be a stressful time for families. The average portfolio for an 18-year-old in a series with a progressive glide path has 15% in equities and at least 30% in bonds that carry duration and\/or credit risk. In the first four months of 2022, these portfolios saw average declines of 6% to 7% as both equities and bonds sank. More research into spending patterns during a beneficiary's college years may help determine if more conservative options at the end of the glide path may be beneficial for families.Fees Continue to FallAverage fees continue to fall across the investment industry, including 529 savings plans. At the end of 2021, the average fee for an age-based or target-enrollment series was 0.48%, a decline from 0.50% in the year prior. Direct-sold options continue to boast a substantial fee advantage, with average fees of 0.34%, reflecting a decline of 1 basis point from 2020. Meanwhile, advisor-sold plans remain significantly more expensive, with average fees of 0.84%, a decline of 5 basis points from the year prior.     Since their inception, 529 portfolios have often charged higher fees than comparable mutual funds and target-date series owing to additional layers of fees: one for the program manager of the investments and one for the state offering the plan. Over the years, some plans have reduced fees by trimming the state fees and negotiating with their program manager for lower fees. Plans with a growing and relatively larger asset base can achieve some economies of scale, which can be passed on to investors through lower fees. In 2021, Georgia's Silver-rated Path2College 529 Plan earned the distinction of offering the cheapest target-enrollment series, with average fees of 0.09%, a significant decline from its prior fees of 0.22%. This is notable as fee cuts tend to be much smaller. That year, the Georgia Higher Education Savings Board decided to waive its state administrative fee of 0.06% and also successfully negotiated lower program manager fees with TIAA-CREF during the contract renewal process. Other notable fee cuts came from Illinois. For its Neutral-rated Bright Directions Advisor-Guided 529 age-based series, the state shifted to lower cost-managers in certain asset classes, resulting in average fee declines of 9 to 12 basis points across its aggressive, moderate, and conservative series. For Illinois' Gold-rated Bright Start Direct-Sold College Savings, the blend series saw an average decline of 3 basis points, partly owing to a partial shift from active to passive for international-equity exposure. Last year, fee cuts also resulted from a change in program manager. Colorado's Scholars Choice Education Savings Plan selected TIAA-CREF to take over its advisor-sold plan, which now charges average fees of 0.77% for its target-enrollment series, a 16-basis-point decline from the year prior.     Advisor-sold plans remain more expensive than direct-sold plans, and Exhibit 5 provides a partial explanation, as it shows that on average, advisor-sold plans hold a higher percentage of actively managed strategies in their age-based or target-enrollment series. The most expensive offering in the 529 industry is Alaska's John Hancock Freedom 529, whose all-active age-based series charges an average fee of 1.21%. While the series was designed by the topnotch multi-asset team at T. Rowe Price, the exorbitant fees limit its Morningstar Analyst Rating to Neutral. The least expensive advisor-sold option with an all-active underlying lineup is Bronze-rated CollegeAmerica, which is sponsored by Virginia. The plan charges average fees of 0.77% for its target-enrollment series.Another reason for advisor-sold plans' higher fees is the annual distribution (or sales) fees paid to the advisor. Arizona, Maine, and North Dakota each offer an advisor-sold age-based or target-enrollment series that only holds low-cost index funds. The weighted average fees for the underlying index funds range from 0.04% to 0.15%, but after the addition of the management, state, and sales fees, the total expense ratios for these series rise to an expensive range of 0.59% to 0.79%.Morningstar doesn't prefer active or passive funds for age-based or target-enrollment series, but our research has consistently shown that over time, lower-fee options provide a reliable edge relative to peers. Lower fees present lower performance hurdles, putting less pressure on portfolio managers to take more risk to make up their funds' costs. It's hard even for outstanding asset allocation and talented managers to consistently overcome high costs, especially when their styles are out of favor. Low fees, however, are a dependable advantage that compounds over time and lead to better investor outcomes.This is the fifth and final article in this year's Morningstar series on 529 savings plans.

{"Article Title":" Myths About 529 Plans    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1094568\/myths-about-529-plans","Article Content":"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. 529 education savings plans are popular tools for saving for college. Yet, despite that popularity, misunderstandings abound about them. Joining me today to provide some clarity on several 529 plan myths is Patty Oey. Patty is a senior analyst with Morningstar's manager research group.Hi, Patty, nice to see you.Patricia Oey: Good to see you, too. Dziubinski: One myth about 529 plans is that they can only be used to cover college tuition. But that's really only part of the story. What else can 529 assets be used to pay for?Oey: Yeah, so you're right. Definitely tuition and fees. It actually can also cover room and board. And should you decide to live off-campus, you can use 529 money to pay for those expenses, up to what the college charges for room and board. So you can do that as well. And then 529 money can also be used for books and your computer. And then the IRS has a list of what other qualified expenses are, but those are the big categories and the big expenses.Dziubinski: Now, in some states also 529 plans can be used for some K through 12 expenses. Is that right? Oey: Yes, that's correct. The federal government put that in one of their recent acts. And at the state level, not all states have agreed to this idea. And so what happens is that if you're in a state which does not allow that, what will happen is that when you take money out of your 529 and then use it to pay for K through 12 private-school tuition, it will not account as a qualified expense, and then you will be charged a penaltyDziubinski: Got it. Now, another myth, perhaps, is that investors are better off sticking with their own-state-sponsored 529 plan because they're going to get some sort of tax benefit in doing so. But not all states offer a tax benefit. Right?Oey: Right. Yes, about a handful of states don't offer any state tax benefit. And when we say \"tax benefit,\" we mean state income tax. So like a deduction when you're calculating your state income tax liability. Some states don't offer it. Some states like Florida and Nevada, they don't have an income tax, so there's no benefit to offer. And then maybe about 30 states offer some kind of benefit, but it's important to consider what the benefit is. For one example: Rhode Island, the maximum deduction you can take is $1,000. If you just kind of back-of-the-envelope estimate, if you're a family, you make $100,000 a year, you file jointly, if you make $1,000 contribution to a 529 account or three, you can only deduct $1,000. And then given their tax rates, that's only a savings of like $50, which is not that significant. Other states have a higher limit on how much you can deduct. And maybe if the state taxes are also higher, that same family contributing $3,000, maybe that's worth a couple of hundred dollars per year. Dziubinski: Even if your state does offer a tax deduction or a tax benefit, like you're talking about, there are reasons sometimes where you wouldn't even, nevertheless, you wouldn't stick with your state's plan.Oey: Right. If the tax benefit is not attractive, but also you can look at the plan. If the investment options are fairly mediocre and, then again, if the fees are really high, definitely you can consider looking at other plans. At Morningstar, we do rate over 60 plans. Some of the summaries of our ratings are available on our website. And if you're a subscriber, you can also look at the individual reports on the individual plans.Dziubinski: Another myth is that there are contribution limits to 529 plans, which maybe change annually the way contribution limits change to IRAs or 401(k)s, but that's not the case, right?Oey: I mean, technically, when you contribute into a 529 account, it's considered a gift. So it's subject to the gift tax. And so the exclusion in 2022 is $16,000. And that is per beneficiary, per giver. So, I can give $16,000 to son number one, I can give $16,000 to son number two, and then if my husband wanted to, he can do the same, effectively doubling our gift. If you were to go over the exclusion, it just counts against your lifetime exclusion, which is $12 million.Dziubinski: Patty, another myth that some people believe is that 529 plans will get in the way of how much financial aid a child will qualify for. Is that true?Oey: Yes, this is a very popular question, and a lot of people are concerned about it. When you want to apply for financial aid, you have to fill out the FAFSA form. What the government does is that it evaluates how much the parents can contribute for your education. So they look at the parents' income\u2014that is weighed most heavily in terms of how much the parents can afford to pay for school. They also look at savings; that's weighed a lot less, and in that savings bucket includes 529 but also includes bank accounts and other investment accounts. But the idea is that if you are going to be using savings to pay for the school, then it just makes a lot of sense to invest in a 529 account with the tax benefits. But overall, anything that you do to reduce the potential need for more debt in the future will benefit the child in the future.Dziubinski: And then lastly, some might think, \"OK, well, I want to set up a 529 plan, but I'm a little uncertain whether the beneficiary is going to pursue a college education, and then what happens to the money? Is it taxed? Is it gone? What happens?\" And that's not really the case? What are some things that can be done with 529 assets if, in fact, that beneficiary decides not to pursue what people might think of as a traditional four-year college education?Oey: Right? Yeah\u2014money disappearing? Nobody wants to hear that. So yes, the child maybe gets a full scholarship or decides not to go to school, there are options. The tax code is pretty liberal. You can change the beneficiary. And typically, you can change it to another member of the family, and they are reasonably liberal, where you can change it to another child, but you can also change it to a niece or nephew, a cousin, and also spouses. The IRS has the list, but it's pretty broad in terms of who you can change it to. There's no tax liability for that change. Some might say that there's always the risk that the government will change the laws in the future, and then you know, that would be a problem. That's not on the table right now. It's not a concern at this moment.Dziubinski: Great. Well, Patty, thank you so much for helping bust some of these 529 myths. We appreciate your time.Oey: Thank you.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Thanks for tuning in.","Article Anthor":"Patricia Oey,  Susan Dziubinski","Article Date":1653004800000}

{"Article Title":" Vanguard Maintains Its Lead in 529 Plans    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1094478\/vanguard-maintains-its-lead-in-529-plans","Article Content":"Assets in 529 savings accounts grew over the course of 2021, to $461 billion from $394 billion, reflecting both investor inflows and healthy market appreciation. Overall, the firms most frequently trusted to manage those assets\u2014Vanguard, Capital Group, and Fidelity\u2014remained the same over the past three years. 529 plans are sponsored by individual states, which partner with asset managers, record keepers, or banks to select the investments and to design and manage the plan. Vanguard, Capital Group, and Fidelity are attractive partners, offering strong and broad lineups of mutual funds and well-resourced multi-asset investment teams with established track records.Individually, Vanguard is synonymous with diversification and low fees, Capital Group is renowned for its compelling actively managed offerings, and Fidelity brings together its strength in both active and passive investing to offer more choices to investors. Together, these three firms are responsible for over half of 529 assets under management and their proclivities provide an interesting snapshot of the industry.     VanguardVanguard has more 529 assets than any other firm, with an estimated 30% market share of assets under management. Out of 86 education savings plans, 15 hold all-Vanguard lineups for the equity and bond exposures in their age-based or target-enrollment series. About 10 other plans have offerings where a majority of assets are in Vanguard funds but also include funds from other families. Across all these plans, the most common holdings are Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VSMPX, Vanguard Total International Stock Index VTPSX, and Vanguard Total Bond Market Index VBMPX. Most also hold Vanguard Total International Bond Index VTIFX, and some hold Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index VTSPX. These funds are diversified and attractively priced, a combination of characteristics that continues to support each of their medalist Morningstar Analyst Ratings.     While these plans benefit from this straightforward fund lineup, we have different ratings across plans that hold Vanguard funds in their age-based or target-enrollment series. States that choose Vanguard funds do so because of low fees, simplicity, and broad diversification. But some states do not follow Vanguard's recommendations on how to combine and employ these holdings in an age-based or target-enrollment series. For example, Neutral-rated College Savings Iowa 529 Plan offers four risk tracks, instead of Vanguard's recommended three. The Iowa plan also deviates from Vanguard's glide path of 12.5% equity step-downs, with its Aggressive Growth and Growth options exhibiting large single-day 20% and 30% cuts in equities at the end of the glide path. This exposes investors to market-timing risk and drives our Negative Process rating in this instance. The other two Neutral-rated plans, Arkansas' Brighter Future Direct and North Dakota's College SAVE Plan, are weighed by relatively high fees and weak state oversight.     Capital GroupCapital Group (the parent company of American Funds) has the second-largest market share at 20%, or $93 billion in assets. This is accomplished with one plan, CollegeAmerica, which Capital Group manages with minimal interference from its state partner Virginia. This Bronze-rated plan benefits from Capital Group's dedicated multi-asset specialists and seasoned equity and fixed-income investors. CollegeAmerica offers a target-enrollment series with a relatively smooth glide path, and features well-regarded actively managed funds, 87% of which received a Morningstar Medalist rating as of May 2022. While CollegeAmerica earns praise for its investment team and underlying processes, this advisor-sold plan is pricey.     FidelityThe firm with the third-largest market share, at about 9%, is Fidelity. Unlike Capital Group's single plan, Fidelity runs a number of plans and has had long, 20-plus-year partnerships with states such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Delaware. In 2021, the firm won two new mandates and now serves as the program manager for Connecticut's direct- and advisor-sold plans. This brings the total number of plans under Fidelity's purview to eight.     Across these plans, Fidelity offers the same glide path designed by the firm's experienced and well-resourced asset-allocation team. The direct-sold plans provide the option of three tracks (one that uses all actively managed Fidelity funds, one that uses all index funds, and one that uses a mix) and the advisor-sold offers one active track. The underlying holdings are all Fidelity Series funds, many of which are clones of Morningstar Medalists or are managed by Fidelity's top managers such as Jed Weiss for Fidelity Series International Growth FIGSX, Ford O'Neill for Fidelity Series Investment Grade Bond FSIGX, and Matthew Fruhan for Fidelity Series Large Cap Stock FGLGX. Though it manages less 529 assets than either Vanguard or Capital Group, Fidelity provides choice (active, passive, or a blend), and that contributes to its ongoing appeal.Asset managers trailing behind these three market share leaders in 529 assets are firms such as Columbia, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, Nuveen, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Voya, which each hold market shares of 1% to 8%. This is the fourth in a five-article series on 529 college savings plans.

{"Article Title":" How to Allocate Assets for College Savings    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/844386\/how-to-allocate-assets-for-college-savings","Article Content":"A version of this article was originally published on Jan. 25, 2021.Finding the right asset allocation--or mix of investments--for college can be a tricky business. If you're a minimalist, it may be tempting to buy a good-quality balanced fund and call it a day. Especially if you're just starting out and the assets in the college savings plan are still small, it may seem like overkill to manage a college portfolio with lots of moving parts.There are certainly worse ways to go about saving for college (life insurance, anyone?). But before you invest your college savings in anything, it's worth considering how investing for college is different from saving for that other long-term goal--retirement. Those differences, in turn, argue for taking a more hands-on approach to asset allocation than a balanced fund would allow. Nor do target-retirement vehicles fit as one-stop options for college savers. Truncated Time HorizonIn contrast to retirement, your child's college matriculation year isn't a negotiable date. A person who encounters a bear market shortly before retirement may have some wiggle room to keep working or rely on other sources of income to avoid tapping his nest egg at a low ebb. But try telling your 18-year-old that he'll have to wait until age 21 to start school so that his college fund will have time to recover.In addition, your time horizon for saving for college is much shorter than is the case for retirement, as is the time horizon for spending those assets. One might save for retirement for 40 years or more and be retired for another 30 or 35 years. But you have less than half that amount of time to amass the funds needed for college, and if all goes well, you'll spend down those assets quickly--in four years or so, or perhaps a few more if you're also footing the bill for graduate school.Both of those facts call for a much steeper glide path--the gradual shift from more-volatile investments such as stocks to more-conservative investments such as bonds--in the years leading up to and during college than the typical glide path before and during retirement. A college portfolio's asset allocation should begin downshifting into cash and bonds when the child is in grade school, and the portfolio should be dominated by bonds by the time the child is in high school. That's because an equity-heavy college fund that encounters a bear market in the years leading up to college could incur losses that it couldn't recoup during the student's time horizon. Even parents who worry that they're grievously behind on college savings should resist the urge to swing for the fences by maintaining a too-high equity allocation too long. (That may be a great temptation for college savers right now, as stocks have trumped bonds and cash over the past decade.)Inflation a Bigger FoeYet college savers must strike a tricky balance because the risks of being too conservative also loom large. Inflation is a major foe for college savers, and a portfolio heavy in bonds and cash could have trouble keeping up with rising tuition costs.While college costs have come under some pressure very recently, the college inflation rate has been double the rate of general inflation since 2001. But current yields have historically been a good predictor of future bond returns, and the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, which serves as a broad bond market benchmark, is currently yielding about 1.7%. That means that investors with extremely conservative asset-allocation plans are going to have difficulty matching the rate of college inflation. Finding a BaselineGiven the specific considerations that should go into a college savings allocation plan, it's probably no wonder that the age-based options within 529 college savings plans have historically held the lion's share of assets. Age-based options aim to provide age-appropriate asset mixes that gradually become more conservative over time, and in so doing they take the onus off of parents and other family members to arrive at an optimal asset mix and to provide ongoing oversight of a portfolio of individual holdings.But the age-based plans also vary widely in their glide paths, and plans are increasingly offering multiple options for a given age band: conservative, moderate, and aggressive. That makes it important to conduct due diligence on a prospective plan's asset-allocation framework and see how it compares with other options within that same general age band. If it's an outlier, make sure you understand and agree with the rationale that its managers use for diverging from the peer group.After you select a plan from your (or any other) state from Morningstar's 529 Plan Center map you can see how that state's age-based glide path compares with the 529 averages for that same age band. For example, the Silver-rated Maryland Senator Edward J Kasemeyer College Investment Plan, managed by T. Rowe Price Group TROW, has a heavier equity weighting (green bar) than its peers (gray mountain chart), especially for younger children with several years until college.Even families who aren't using an age-based 529 option can still use 529 glide paths to help get their own plans' asset mixes in the right ballpark. In the table below are the median net equity, bond, and cash weightings for each of Morningstar's age-based 529 categories. You can see that the plans start out with the majority of their assets in equities, then gradually become more conservative over time.","Article Anthor":"Christine Benz","Article Date":1642550400000}
{"Article Title":" 3 Themes Shaping the Future of 529 Savings Plans     ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1040262\/3-themes-shaping-the-future-of-529-savings-plans","Article Content":"As a graduation month, May augurs promise. Students reflect on the knowledge they have acquired and how to put it to use going forward.In a year when many 529 savings plans reached the same age as the college graduates who've tapped their tax-advantaged coffers, it makes sense to consider how these savings tools have evolved, how they can improve, and what they might offer going forward.Since Morningstar assigned its first forward-looking ratings to 529 savings plans in 2012, we've witnessed multiple improvements to these tax-advantaged investing programs as assets climbed from $167 billion to $394 billion. In the 2021 529 Savings Plan Landscape, we identify a few trends that will continue to shape these plans for investors saving for college, K-12, or other types of education expenses going forward. Morningstar Direct and Office clients can access the full paper here.Asset-allocation practices continue to change. There are now 3 times as many portfolios using gradual glide paths to reduce their risk over time--either with target enrollment approaches or age-based steps of less than 10%--than there were in 2016.529 savings plans now offer more flexibility than at any time since they were introduced. Once, investors could only use 529 savings plan assets to pay for college expenses. But as the list of qualified education expenses has grown, 529s are nearing a future where it could be possible for beneficiaries to tap their savings throughout their working lives when personal, social, or economic forces spur them to pivot to new careers or learn new skills, as the pandemic has prompted many to do recently.Several highly populated states are working to broaden the accessibility of 529 savings plans through initiatives like child savings accounts.The Past Year's Top TrendsLast year pandemic-driven campus and economic shutdowns spurred college tuition inflation to sink nearly 50% from a historical 10-year average of 2.8%. Our research shows that all but two 529 portfolios met their goal of beating tuition inflation over the past three years.As ever, falling fees across the investment industry have been a boon to 529 beneficiaries, though direct-sold options continue to have an advantage over advisor-sold options, whose average fee is 0.54 percentage points higher. In fact, as shown below, no advisor-sold age-based tracks fall in the cheapest or second-cheapest quintiles. And when it comes to college savings, every dollar paid in fees is one less dollar for educational expenses.     Portfolio improvements haven't all gone smoothly. In early 2021, education savers in The Vanguard 529 Plan got a lucky break that may have amounted to over $200 million in extra earnings. In October 2020, Vanguard applied the wrong recommendations in Nevada's The Vanguard 529 Plan, leaving its accountholders with 20 percentage points more in stocks than they should have had. Luckily, this occurred as equity markets rallied in late 2020 and early 2021, so the mistake actually helped investors.Nevada, the plan's investment consultant, and Vanguard didn't notice the mistake for several months before fixing it in March, illustrating that vigilant implementation is as important as plan structure, even for straightforward portfolios like Vanguard's. This is reflected in our updated 529 plan ratings methodology, which assigns value to diligent stewardship and thoughtful collaboration between a state and its program manager or investment consultant. Sharper Asset Allocation in 529 Savings PlansAge-based portfolios are typically the most popular investment options in a 529 savings plan's lineup, followed by static options. These portfolios start out with more equity-heavy asset allocations and transition to conservative portfolios dominated by fixed income as beneficiaries near enrollment, requiring thoughtful curation.There are two types of transitions from stocks to bonds, commonly called glide paths:An age-based glide path makes abrupt shifts to bonds from stocks at predetermined dates by moving assets from one investment option to another, often every few years on a particular date.A progressive track keeps investors' assets in a single investment option--similar to a target-date retirement fund--and uses smaller, more frequent asset-allocation adjustments. This provides a smoother transition that is less susceptible to locking in losses if a rebalance occurs during a period of extreme market stress.Our research shows asset-allocation rebalances of 10 percentage points or less mitigate much of this market risk.Over time, these age-based portfolios have improved by incorporating more gradual risk reductions. As shown below, the percentage of 529 savings plans with large (21% and above) equity steps has steadily decreased (from 41% in 2016 to a mere 3% in 2020) as the percentage of plans with progressive glide paths or minimized equity step-downs (10% or less) has markedly increased (from 21% in 2016 to 58% in 2020). The percentage of plans with a moderate equity step-down (11% to 20%) remained steady at roughly 40% in each of the past five years.     Enhanced Flexibility on Approved Education ExpensesOnce investors could only use 529 savings plan assets to pay for qualified college expenses, but 529 plans now offer far more flexibility than at any time since they were introduced. In 2017, K-12 educational expenses joined the list of approved uses for the funds, and the 2019 Secure Act made it possible to pay for apprenticeship programs and cover up to $10,000 in outstanding student loan debt. If they keep evolving like this, 529 savings plans could morph into tax-advantaged pools of assets that beneficiaries could tap throughout their working lives in order to pivot to new careers or learn new skills.Today, investors with nontraditional time horizons or lumpy expenses can use static options, which are stand-alone investments that don't shift asset allocations over time. These options span the risk spectrum, from money market funds all the way to international-stock funds, and plans usually have an array of options for investors to choose from. If flexible spending gains popularity, 529 savings plans could start offering asset-allocation options managed to indefinite horizons, as health savings accounts do.Treading New Ground to Make Education AccessibleState-sponsored education plans took their current shape under section 529 of the tax code over 21 years ago. Through tax incentives that encourage families to invest over time to fund education expenses, these plans help reduce the burden of education loans on young adults and their families. However, from a tax perspective, higher-income families have benefited the most from these incentives. Currently, joint filers making $80,000 or less don't pay taxes on investment gains in taxable accounts. This, in turn, has shaped 529 plan participation, which skews to wealthier households.Many states are working to broaden the accessibility of these investment tools to include lower-income households. Child savings accounts are one idea. These state programs, such as Pennsylvania's Keystone Scholars program (launched in 2019), seed 529 savings accounts with an initial deposit, typically ranging from $50 to $100, for every baby born to or adopted by in-state families. Illinois and California plan to launch similar programs soon. Combined, these three states' initiatives will expand the availability of these accounts to families within three of the 10 largest states in the United States.Child savings accounts encourage lower-income households to start making regular contributions early, but they also may limit savers' choices and lock them into subpar in-state 529 savings plans. Whether a 529 plan has an associated child savings account or not doesn't affect its Morningstar Analyst Rating, which focuses on the people, parent, and process that directly support a plan. Plans with child savings accounts, though, may appeal to investors who consider environmental, social, and governance factors in their decisions since the programs attempt to help solve a social issue.","Article Anthor":"Madeline Hume","Article Date":1621468800000}
{"Article Title":" When Should You Start Saving for College?    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1010710\/when-should-you-start-saving-for-college","Article Content":"Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I'm Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. Last month, Morningstar released its annual ratings of the best 529 college savings plans for 2020. But choosing a good plan isn't enough. Time is an important part of the equation. Joining me today to discuss when you should start saving for college is Madeline Hume. Madeline is an analyst in Morningstar's Manager Research group on the multi-asset team.Thanks for being here today, Madeline.Madeline Hume: Thank you so much for having me, Susan. Dziubinski: Let's start off by talking a little bit about the ratings. Morningstar made some methodology changes to the ratings this year. Can you talk a little bit about those?Hume: Absolutely. One of the changes that we made was to make our ratings simpler. We now rate four underlying pillars instead of five that roll up to our overall ratings of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. Our Performance Pillar is now getting absorbed into other assessments. Another was to provide greater transparency into what's really driving our ratings, with our written analysis expressing our pillar ratings across the five-point scale, ranging from High to Low.Our Price Pillar puts even greater emphasis on the absolute value of a plan's fees and now conveys our assessment of a plan's fees irrespective of its distribution channel or the strategy of the underlying investment options. As a result, this new methodology favors direct-sold plans over advisor-sold plans. Given how much the investments that 529 plans hold have improved over recent years, our new People Pillar emphasizes the team behind a plan's investment options, which raises the bar for a plan's investment resources. We also don't include any tax benefits in our analysis anymore, given how highly individualized the benefits that individuals receive from contributing to a 529 plan can be.Dziubinski: Given those changes to our methodology, which plans came out with our highest rating of Gold? Did they share any particular traits?Hume: Yes. Two plans were reaffirmed at Gold this year. Bright Start Direct out of Illinois and Utah's my529 plan. Joining them this year was a new entrant, which was Michigan's Education Savings Program. These plans are all unique, but what they have in common is low costs, strong stewardship, and exceptional asset allocation. Any investor that finds themselves in these plans can have confidence that they've made an excellent choice. Dziubinski: And let's look at the flip side. What are some plans that didn't fare quite as well under our new approach?Hume: Our enhanced methodology does set a higher standard for Neutral ratings, and six plans failed to reach that bar for the first time this year, receiving downgrades to Negative and joining two other plans that were previously given that designation. Five of these downgrades were for those more expensive advisor-sold plans that I mentioned. And all eight of these plans currently charge fees that investors are better off avoiding even if they live in a state that provides some tax benefits for investing in that plan. Some may also have significant design flaws, like large allocation steps.Dziubinski: If someone is looking to open a 529 college savings account, how can they use these ratings to help inform that decision?Hume: Our Medalist-rated plans carry our strongest recommendations from Gold at the highest level down to Bronze. For investors that live in a state with no state-specific income tax benefits or if you have a home state that earns one of these designations, you need look no further than this short list. However, many states offer state-specific incentives and may make up for a so-so plan, which we would give a Neutral rating under our methodology. Again, we don't take those tax benefits into account anymore, given how highly specific each tax situation for a college saver is. So, in those cases, investors should weigh the potential cost savings of a yearly tax benefit against the higher expense ratios and lower-quality investments that these plans provide, ideally in consultation with a financial advisor.Dziubinski: Now, many of these age-based plans work under the assumption that these assets are invested for 18 years. But given how hard choosing a plan can be and saving for college can be, when have you found that families actually start saving for college?Hume: Right. We conducted a study last year that shows that the average 529 account is open when a child is 7 years old and that only gives him 11 years to save for college. That makes an already compressed investing time horizon that much more fraught, and a lot of these plans are designed with 18-year time horizons in mind, so investors aren't getting the full utility out of these plans that they offer.Dziubinski: Then what's the opportunity cost to an investor by starting so late?Hume: Based on that study, to put it into context, for a $50,000 total savings balance, even one additional year that investors delay can cost some potential gains of up to $5,900 depending on when that account is open.Dziubinski: Now, that's significant. What if you are one of those late-start college savers? Do you have any suggestions for those people and what they might be able to do to play a little catch-up?Hume: Right. It's tough. College savers who start investing in 529 plans later do miss out on those equity-heavy portfolios with the most growth potential. While stocks are certainly more volatile than bonds, they do have greater return potential over the long run, and each year that investors wait lowers the growth potential of their savings as age-based portfolios gradually de-risk. College savers may be tempted to make up for lost time by making large contributions or taking on additional risk in their portfolios, but it is hard to make up for years of missed compounding, which underscores the virtue of saving for college as soon as possible. However, college savers do have some benefits that other investment savers like retirement savers don't have, which include student loans and other kind of less traditional investment options. It's prudent to consider the entire menu of options that are available to college savers beyond just the 529 account.Dziubinski: Madeleine, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate it.Hume: Thank you so much, Susan.Dziubinski: I'm Susan Dziubinski for Morningstar. Thank you for tuning in.","Article Anthor":"Madeline Hume,  Susan Dziubinski","Article Date":1606780800000}
{"Article Title":" What Bad Returns at the Wrong Time Can Mean for College    ","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/articles\/1003382\/what-bad-returns-at-the-wrong-time-can-mean-for-college","Article Content":"I\u2019ve written a couple of articles about how sequence-of-returns risk can affect portfolio values both for retirees making portfolio withdrawals, and younger investors who are putting money away for the future. The order in which returns unfold over time is important because it can affect the dollar value of a portfolio that has cash flows from contributions or withdrawals. In a nutshell, the periods when more dollars are invested will carry more weight in your overall results.In this article, I'll explain how even a year or two of bad equity-market returns can affect portfolio values for college savers and give some practical tips for dealing with this risk. I'll focus mainly on 529 plans, which we've covered extensively as one of the best vehicles available for families planning ahead to cover the costs of college education.Background The sequence of returns typically comes up in the context of investing for retirement. A negative sequence of returns during the first few years of retirement can be detrimental because it's a double whammy: It cuts into the portfolio's value right away, but can also put long-term sustainability at risk because as retirees make withdrawals, there's less money left to benefit from an eventual market recovery.  The situation is a bit different for parents or other relatives planning ahead for a child's college education, because both savings and withdrawals are made over a shorter period. While younger investors can invest for retirement over a period of four decades or more, parents usually only have about 18 years to put money away for college. And withdrawals made to pay for college costs typically take place over about four years, compared with a much longer (but ultimately unknown) time horizon for retirees.Because of this compressed time horizon, the main risk for college savers isn't technically the sequence of returns, but really the risk of an equity-market downturn that happens shortly before planned withdrawals start. It's also worth noting that investors can sidestep this risk by using age-based investment options that automatically ratchet down their equity exposure based on the child\u2019s age. Surprisingly, though, age-based and target-enrollment portfolios account for only about a third of all 529 plan assets, with the remainder invested in static allocation portfolios.As with saving for retirement, negative equity-market returns are less of an issue early on. If you're just starting to invest in a 529 plan or other college-savings vehicle for a newborn or young child, a year or two of negative returns won\u2019t dramatically affect your long-term results. But as the portfolio value increases, the risk of too much equity exposure becomes more dangerous. This makes the last few years before your child starts college critically important. In a worst-case scenario, a market downturn later in high school--right in the middle of the usual swirl of activity with college visits, standardized tests, and last-minute applications--could depress the portfolio\u2019s value right before you\u2019ll need to start making tuition payments. Let\u2019s look at a couple of examples to see how this can play out in practice. For illustration purposes, I used an all-equity portfolio and assumed that parents or other college savers contributed $1,000 per year from a child\u2019s birth up through age 18. That\u2019s on the low end given recent costs for tuition, room, and board, but the same patterns would apply with larger contribution amounts. The table below shows portfolio values for a child born in 1984 assuming consistent annual contributions and actual equity market performance through 2002.Exhibit 1: How Sequence of Returns Can Hurt College Savings     Source: Author's calculations. Note: Portfolio values based on $1,000 annual contributions (not adjusted for inflation) and actual returns for the S&P 500 from 1984 to 2002.Up until age 15, this was a pretty positive period for market performance. The portfolio kept chugging along with positive total returns almost every single year, suffering only a small loss in 1990. Assets would have peaked (reaching nearly $94,000) around the child\u2019s freshman year of high school. But with the tech correction starting in 2000, things started to go south. After three straight years of market losses, the portfolio would have shed more than a third of its value by the end of 2002. If the sequence of returns had been reversed, the picture would be far brighter. The chart below shows the portfolio\u2019s value over a hypothetical period during which the S&P 500 earned the same returns as it did from 1984 through 2002, but in reverse order.Despite a rough start with three straight years of negative returns, the portfolio\u2019s value would reach more than $108,000 by the end of the period--about $47,000 higher than in the previous example. That would give the family far more flexibility; they could opt for a more-expensive college, carry over some assets to cover the cost of graduate school, or transfer assets to a younger sibling or other family member. (This is one attractive aspect of 529 plans; account owners can change the plan's beneficiary as long as the new assignee is a family member of the previous one.)Exhibit 2: Different Sequence, Different Results     Source: Author's calculations. Note: Portfolio values based on $1,000 annual contributions (not adjusted for inflation) and actual returns for the S&P 500 from 2002 to 1984 (in reverse order). Mitigating the Risk Of course, these are extreme examples; maintaining an all-equity college fund throughout your child's entire childhood isn't prudent or advisable. And in fact, adding a healthy stake in fixed-income securities is one of the best ways to offset the potential risk of equity-market losses. Although bonds can also be subject to risk from return patterns over time, returns typically fall in a smaller range and can help buffer some of the risk of an equity market downturn. But because of the relatively short time period of a typical four-year college education, a year or two of bad returns at the wrong time can still create problems for more-balanced portfolios. The table below shows the potential impact of the 2008 bear market as an example. While the correction was pretty short-lived, it still would have had a lasting impact, even for a portfolio with a 40% stake in bonds. The bond position helped buffer some of the losses, but the portfolio would have still shed about 20% of its value in 2008. Even with positive total returns for the next three years, the portfolio would have fallen short of the amount needed to cover planned withdrawals of $100,000 over four years.     To avoid this problem, it makes sense to shift toward a much more conservative asset mix in the years leading up to college. As mentioned above, age-based and target-enrollment portfolios can be a sensible, low-effort way to keep risk exposure at the right level. Almost all 529 plans offer these options, which automatically shift their asset mixes more toward cash and bonds as the beneficiary approaches college age.A typical asset mix would be mostly equity starting at birth, gradually shifting down to about 60% in stocks at age 9, 40% at age 13, 30% at age 15, 20% at age 17, and 14% at age 18. Not every age-based track makes gradual adjustments, though. Age-based tracks shift their equity exposure on predetermined dates, and some age-based tracks (such as Iowa's growth track) sell out of 20% or more in stocks on a single day. If stocks happen to sink on the same day, 529 plan owners could end up effectively locking in those losses, exacerbating the risk of a shortfall.Exhibit 4: Median Equity Allocation by Age     Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 8\/31\/2020. Equity weightings reflect target equity allocations for 529 plan portfolios in Morningstar's database.Many 529 plans also offer options for different levels of risk, typically labeled as aggressive, moderate, and conservative. The aggressive option for Utah\u2019s 529 plan, for example, targets 70% equity exposure for age 10, compared with 50% for the moderate track and 30% for the conservative option. Choosing the right mix is a matter of personal preference, but also depends on each family\u2019s circumstances. If you want to help finance post-graduate studies or plan to \u201coverfund\u201d the 529 plan with a view toward saving for future beneficiaries, tilting a bit more toward stocks might make sense, as long as you\u2019re willing to live with the additional risk.Do-it-yourself investors can also build a more customized asset mix. In addition to age-based options, most 529 plans offer individual funds that can be used as building blocks for targeting a specific blend of stocks, bonds, and cash. One relatively straightforward option would be to focus more on stocks early on, then shift into a balanced fund combining stocks and bonds, and then gradually build up more bonds and cash during the high-school years.Conclusion Planning for college can be an overwhelming task, and trying to avoid bad returns at the wrong time adds another layer of complexity. But making sure your college fund's asset mix isn't too heavy on stocks--especially as your child approaches college age--is one way to avoid an unexpected outcome.","Article Anthor":"Amy Arnott","Article Date":1601856000000}

If you don't handle your refund correctly, it could be seen as a withdrawal to cover nonqualified expenses, which would be subject to tax penalties.There are two ways to deal with a refund to avoid paying extra taxes: You can spend the refund on other qualified expenses or put the money back into any 529 account with the same beneficiary. If you choose the latter, the refund must come directly from a college or university, and the timing of when you make the deposit is crucial. What to keep in mind: Typically, 529 account owners must deposit the refund into the account within 60 days or the refund will be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal, which gets a tax penalty.The money does not need to go to the same 529 plan that you made the original withdrawal from, but the refund must go back into a plan with the same beneficiary.If you wait longer than 60 days to deposit the money back into a 529 account, it will be considered a new contribution, and the tax penalty on the refund will still apply.This 60-day rule has shifted slightly in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As stated in IRS Notice 2020-23, 529 account owners who got refunds prior to May 15 now have until July 15 to redeposit the funds into a 529 account. The 60-day window still applies to account owners who receive refunds after May 15.Could I use my refund to cover next year's expenses? While the 60-day period doesn't apply when you choose to use your refund on other qualified expenses, timing is still important if you want to avoid tax penalties.What to keep in mind: You must make your withdrawal in the same tax year that you pay for the qualified expenses.If you file your taxes using a calendar-year period, which is typical, you can use your refund to cover qualified education expenses, like tuition and room and board, for the fall semester because the refund and payment fall in the same tax year.Even if you are technically paying for 2021 costs, the refund will still count as a qualified withdrawal if you make the payment in 2020.What are some expenses that I could use my refund to cover? You can use tax-free withdrawals from a 529 account to pay for qualified expenses (see Section 8 of this IRS document) that include tuition, mandatory fees, books, computers and software. Because many colleges and universities have set up online courses, it may make sense to use the money to pay for Internet access or to purchase a computer.You could also put the refund toward student loans. As part of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, or SECURE Act, up to $10,000 total from a 529 plan can be used to repay the beneficiary\u2019s student loans. This includes federal and most private loans. Further, an additional $10,000 can go toward each of the beneficiary\u2019s siblings\u2019 student loans.Of course, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to using 529 funds. But it\u2019s important for investors to understand what costs you can cover without any tax penalty.What are the tax penalties for nonqualified withdrawals? Transportation, extracurricular activities, health insurance, and other noneducation costs are considered nonqualified expenses.What to keep in mind:Any taxes or extra tax penalties will only apply to the money that your 529 plan's investments earn because the contributions you make have already been taxed.Withdrawals from 529s must be a combination of contributions you made to the account and the money you earn from the plan's investments. For example, if your account has $4,000 in contributions and $6,000 in investment earnings, withdrawing $1,000 takes $400 from contributions and $600 from earnings.Withdrawals for nonqualified expenses get a 10% tax penalty on the investment earnings portion. For example, if you use $1,000 on nonqualified expenses and $600 of the withdrawal come from earnings, you will owe an extra $60 in taxes on top of any income taxes that you owe on that $600.You will owe applicable federal income taxes on your investment earnings but not contributions.You may have to repay any state income tax breaks you received on those contributions.","Article Anthor":"Margaret Giles","Article Date":1589155200000}
