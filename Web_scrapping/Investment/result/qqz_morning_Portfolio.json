{"Article Title":"It\u2019s Too Soon to Say the Value Premium Is Dead","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/its-too-soon-say-value-premium-is-dead","Article Content":"The underperformance of U.S. value stocks since the Great Recession has received much attention from the financial media, and prompted at least some investors to conclude that value investing is dead. That has led to papers being written, such as AQR\u2019s May 2020 article, \u201cIs (Systematic) Value Investing Dead?\u201d Because the value premium has been much larger in small stocks than in large, we\u2019ll review the performance of small-value stocks compared with broad market indexes. From 2008 through July 2023, while the S&P 500 returned 9.8% per year, the Fama-French small-value research portfolio returned 8.6%, an underperformance of 1.2 percentage points annually. (Fama-French data is from Ken French\u2019s website.)A Cautionary TaleWe heard the same argument about the death of the value premium in 2000. From 1994 to 1999, the S&P 500 returned 23.6%, annually outperforming the Fama-French small-value research portfolio by 7.2 percentage points. However, the declaration of the death of the value premium was premature. From 2000 to 2007, while the S&P 500 returned 1.7%, the Fama-French small-value research portfolio returned 16.2%, outperforming by 14.5 percentage points annually. Such performance should be a cautionary tale for those declaring the death of value.If the underperformance of the value premium in U.S. stocks since 2008 was a sign that value was dead, we should see similar underperformance outside the U.S. From 2008 through July 2023, the MSCI EAFE Index returned 3.2%, but the Dimensional International Small Cap Value Index returned 5.2%, outperforming by 2.0 percentage points annually. In emerging markets, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index returned 1.7%, the Dimensional Emerging Markets Targeted Value Index returned 4.1%, outperforming by 2.4 percentage points. Thus, outside the U.S., investors who diversified their portfolios to include small-value stocks benefited. We can now examine how a globally diversified small-value-oriented portfolio performed over this 15-year-plus period relative to a market-based portfolio. Roughly allocating to the global market capitalization, we can assign a 50% weighting to U.S. stocks, a 37.5% weighting to non-U.S. developed stocks, and a 12.5% weighting to emerging-markets stocks. This hypothetical, globally diversified, market-based portfolio with those weights would have returned 5.84% annually, underperforming the return of 6.33% of a globally diversified small-value portfolio. And this was perhaps the worst 15-year period for value stocks, ending with the spread in valuations between growth and value stocks being about as wide as they were at the end of the dot-com boom\u2014which foreshadowed the largest outperformance ever for small-value stocks.It\u2019s All About ValuationsWhile all crystal balls are cloudy (we cannot know the future), valuations are the best predictor we have of future returns. And small-value stocks are trading at historically cheap valuations relative to their market counterparts, indicating the likelihood of a large premium going forward. The table below shows the relative valuations of Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF AVUV and Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF AVDV, along with Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF AVES, compared with Vanguard\u2019s broad market index funds, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VTSMX, Vanguard Developed Markets Index VTMGX, and Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index VEIEX.\n\t\t\tValuations of Selected Indexes\n\t\t      The increase in relative valuations has left the value spread at historically high levels. That raises the question: Does the value spread contain information about future returns? To answer that question, Avantis examined the historical data from Dec. 31, 1979, to Dec. 31, 2019. The table below shows the subsequent five-year return difference between value and growth when the valuation spread is below the median and above the median. It makes clear that the valuation spread does contain information about future returns\u2014the future value premium tends to be much higher after periods when the valuation spread is above the median spread\u2014and it is well above the median today.\n\t\t\tMonthly Valuation Spreads\n\t\t      Investor TakeawaysWhile there are no crystal balls, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any strong evidence that the value premium is dead. The poor recent performance has been due to changes in what John Bogle called the \u201cspeculative return\u201d (the change in relative valuations). In support of this idea, consider the following.Let\u2019s go back in time to the end of 2016 and ask if the value premium was dead based on the out-of-sample returns (after the publication of the original Fama-French research on the value premium) over the 25-year period 1992 through 2016. During this period, the Russell 1000 Growth Index returned 8.2% per year, underperforming the Russell 1000 Value Index return of 10.1% per year, or by 1.9 percentage points; and the Russell 2000 Growth Index returned 7.4% per year, underperforming the Russell 2000 Value Index, which returned 11.5% per year, by 4.1 percentage points. The annual average value premium was 4.5%, not much different from the 5.1% premium for the period 1927 through 1991. I don\u2019t think anyone would have declared the value premium dead based on those figures. Yet, just a few years later, we hear a clarion cry that the publication of the Fama-French research and cash flows have killed the value premium. Does anyone seriously believe that 25 years was not enough time for publication of the research to kill the premium, but just a few more years did the trick? And if cash flows had killed the premium, 25 years of them should have been enough to accomplish the task.In addition, as David Blitz demonstrated in his study \u201cAre Exchange-Traded Funds Harvesting Factor Premiums?,\u201d while some ETFs are specifically designed for harvesting factor premiums, such as the size, value, momentum, and low-volatility premiums, other ETFs implicitly go against those factors. Specifically, Blitz found that \u201cfrom a factor investing perspective, smart-beta ETFs tend to provide the right factor exposures, while conventional ETFs tend to be on the other side of the trade with the wrong factor exposures. In other words, these two groups of investors are essentially betting against each other.\u201d Despite what many investors believe, there has not been a massive net inflow into value stocks relative to growth stocks.The Comfortable Path or the Diversified One?The takeaway is that investors face a choice. They can either own a traditional 60% market-like equity\/40% bond portfolio, which has most of its risk (as much as 90% or more depending on the maturity and quality of the bond holdings) concentrated in the single factor of market beta, or they can choose to diversify across as many unique sources of risk and return as they can identify that meet all their established criteria. The first path is the comfortable one in the sense that the portfolio will not cause any tracking error regret\u2014investors won\u2019t be underperforming popular benchmarks that are reported on a daily basis by the financial media. On the other hand, that strategy will likely be highly uncomfortable during periods like 1973-74, 2000-02, and 2008, when the single factor (market beta) that dominates their portfolio\u2019s risk suffers from severe bear markets (and also over long periods, such as the 15-year period 1929-43, the 17-year period 1966-82, and the 13-year period 2000-12, when the S&P 500 underperformed riskless one-month Treasury bills).With that said, failing conventionally is always easier than failing unconventionally (misery loves company). And while based on the historical mean and volatility that the market beta premium should be expected to be negative about 9% of the time over 10-year periods, it seems likely that the odds have risen.According to data from Ken French\u2019s website, from 1927 through 2022 the market beta premium was 8.6%. However, most financial economists expect it to be much smaller going forward, perhaps by half. The reason is that valuations are now much higher\u2014in 1927 the CAPE 10 (cyclically adjusted P\/E ratio) was about 13, whereas today it is more than double that, at about 30. Higher valuations forecast lower future returns. A smaller premium with the same volatility means greater odds of negative returns for U.S. stocks.The second path\u2014diversification\u2014is more likely to lead to successfully achieving goals. However, it does mean having to live with the fact that the portfolio will perform very differently than traditional portfolios, creating the risk of tracking variance regret. In that sense, diversification is not a free lunch. It means living through uncomfortable periods, even long ones. And during periods of failure, it means failing unconventionally, which is much harder to deal with.Given that investors must accept that they will have to live through uncomfortable times on whichever path they choose, it seems logical to pick the one with the highest odds of achieving their goals. And that is choosing the more efficient portfolio\u2014the one that is more diversified across factors that provide exposure to unique sources of risk such as size and value\u2014and saying to oneself, \u201cI don\u2019t care about tracking variance regret because relativism [how you performed relative to some popular index] has no place in investing.\u201dThe opinions expressed are the author\u2019s.

{"Article Title":"Best Investments to Own During a Recession","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/best-investments-own-during-recession","Article Content":"The market has been anticipating a recession for quite some time: Since July 2022, the yield curve has been inverted, which has often been a precursor to recessionary periods; investors are betting that economic weakness will lead to lower yields for long-term bonds. So far, a recession hasn\u2019t materialized. Economic growth has remained strong, with generally positive corporate earnings reports and unemployment still close to historic lows.But even if an economic slowdown isn\u2019t imminent, there will be one eventually. The economy moves in cycles, with periods of economic strength followed by contractions and vice versa. Historically, recessions (generally defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining growth in gross domestic product) have occurred about once every five to 10 years, although the length of time between recessionary periods varies.It\u2019s impossible to predict the timing or severity of a potential recession. And in many cases, it\u2019s often only clear that a recession has happened after the fact, or after the market has already started reacting to slower economic growth. That said, looking at which types of investments have historically fared best during economic downturns can help you limit some of the damage. In this article, I\u2019ll look at investing during a recession from multiple angles, including asset classes, factors, and sectors. (Note: For most of this analysis, I\u2019ll focus on the past four or five most recent recessions because performance data is harder to come by for earlier periods.)Asset ClassesFrom an asset-class perspective, stocks are usually one of the worst places to be during a recession. The reason is simple: Recessions happen when there\u2019s a decline in economic activity, which is usually accompanied by weaker trends in revenue and earnings growth. As companies produce less favorable results, their stock prices usually suffer.As a result, stocks had negative returns in most (but not all) previous recessions dating back to the Great Depression. Some of the worst recent results were during the global financial crisis, when stocks lost an annualized 24% between late 2007 and mid-2009.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Asset Class\n\t\t      On the flip side, bonds have been the best place to be in most previous recessions. Investors often seek shelter in lower-risk assets during periods of economic distress, which helps support bond prices. In addition, the Federal Reserve often cuts interest rates in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, also resulting in higher bond prices. Because of their higher level of sensitivity to interest rates, long-term bonds have historically fared best during recessions, although intermediate-term bonds and cash have also been pretty resilient. Gold has also been a winning asset class during recessionary periods, with positive returns during the eight most recent recessions since 1993. But the yellow metal had a relatively anemic showing during recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s; returns were negative after inflation.Investment StyleI used Morningstar\u2019s U.S. equity fund categories as a proxy for measuring investment style. As shown in the table below, growth stocks have typically held up better during recessionary periods. Companies that have growth-oriented stocks typically have higher earnings growth, cleaner balance sheets, and better profitability\u2014all traits that often help them hold up better than companies with cheaper stock prices during recessionary periods. But growth stocks haven\u2019t fared well during every recessionary period. Growth stocks were hit hard in the tech-stock correction in the early 2000s, which coincided with a brief recessionary period in 2001.From a style perspective, large has generally been better than small during periods of economic weakness. Larger companies tend to have more stable earnings, diversified business operations, and the financial wherewithal to sustain their operations even during recessions. Smaller companies, on the other hand, may depend heavily on a single line of business and often have fewer financial reserves to sustain them during recessions.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Investment Style\n\t\t      Equity FactorsEquity factors are another way of examining the drivers of equity market returns. Factors describe additional characteristics (beyond traditional metrics such as sector, market cap, and value\/growth) that help to explain investment management styles and resulting performance differences. Because equity market returns are generally negative during a recessionary period, no investment factor consistently generated positive returns. In relative terms, the quality factor has historically fared best during periods of economic weakness. Definitions for quality vary, but the MSCI index that I used for this study focuses on stocks that score well on three main metrics: high return on equity, stable year-over-year earnings growth, and low financial leverage.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Investment Factor\n\t\t      The minimum volatility factor, which is designed to capture stocks with lower betas, volatility, and idiosyncratic risk, has fared second-best, and dividend stocks have also held up relatively well.On the negative side, the value factor has performed the worst during most recessionary periods by a fairly wide margin. (Note: This benchmark for this factor is similar to the value fund categories I discussed above, but it has more extreme performance traits because it has a more pronounced value bent than the typical value fund.) The value factor tends to be overweighted in economically sensitive sectors, such as basic materials, consumer cyclicals, and financials. This is usually a negative, but the early 1980s\u2019 recession\u2014a \u201cstagflation\u201d period that featured sluggish growth, high inflation, and high unemployment rates\u2014was an exception. The value factor posted the best returns during that period.Equity SectorsFrom a sector perspective, healthcare and consumer staples stocks have been the most resilient performers during periods of economic weakness. Consumers can\u2019t easily cut back on prescription drugs, medical devices, or household basics like canned goods and paper towels even if they\u2019re feeling the effects of a weaker economy.On the negative side, energy and infrastructure stocks have been the hardest-hit in recent recessions. Companies in these sectors are acutely sensitive to swings in demand. Financials stocks also can suffer during recessions because of a rising default rate and shrinking net interest margins.\n\t\t\tTotal Returns (%) by Sector\n\t\t      Technology and communications stocks have a mixed record. During the 1990-91 recession amid the Gulf War and oil supply issues, the communications and technology sectors held up relatively well, and tech leaders such as Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and International Business Machines IBM continued to generate double-digit returns. After surging during most of the 1990s, the tech bubble finally popped in 2000, followed by a brief recession in 2001. Because valuations were still inflated leading up to the recession, the communications and technology sectors suffered the deepest losses.Does the prospect of a looming recession mean you should overhaul your portfolio? No. In fact, making wholesale shifts in portfolio holdings is usually a bad idea. But just like being mentally prepared for winter in Chicago can help longtime residents like me survive the tough season ahead, studying how the market has historically performed can help you set expectations for how your holdings might react if and when the economy weakens.

{"Article Title":"Why I Don\u2019t Own a Home","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/why-i-dont-own-home","Article Content":"Most Americans\u2019 biggest asset, and primary source of wealth, cannot be found in a 401(k) account. Instead, it\u2019s their home. Research done by the Survey of Consumer Finances identified primary residences as the largest asset on household balance sheets.The United States is not the only property-crazed nation out there. Back in June, my colleague Mark LaMonica wrote a wonderful article about the Australian housing market and why he was opting out. Reading Mark\u2019s article, I was floored by how much of it resonated with me. Like him, I am fortunate enough to have the means to purchase a home. Like him, I have opted not to.How Much Money Do I Need to Buy a House?Clearly, I\u2019m going against the grain, and I know it. Only 34% of Americans share my lifestyle; many of them are facing a much different financial picture than I am. And I\u2019m a millennial, which means that I am part of the homeownership-killing generation. I hope that by sharing my personal experience that others may find resonance with it, but of course investing is not one-size-fits-all. Take everything I say with a pinch of salt, ideally sprinkled on top of some avocado toast.A few facts about me before I begin. I am 28 years old. I live in Chicago. I am married, but I do not have kids. I am fortunate that my personal liabilities are light. My parents paid for my college education, so I graduated debt-free. I do not own a car, but my husband does. Since I do not have children, I\u2019m not anchored to a particular school district. What\u2019s Your Investment Approach?In his article, Mark outlined his philosophy for financial success. He organizes his decision-making process around his own personal statement of cash flows, keeping fixed costs at a minimum in order to maximize his flexibility.Others put housing in an entirely separate bucket from their human capital and treat it as a luxury good to consume. To these homeowners, a house is worth the money they put into it simply because they like the stability a home provides.Personally, I can\u2019t stop thinking like an investor, even when I probably should. To make matters worse, I tend to think like a value investor, and value investments can fall out of favor for long periods of time.\n\t\t\tValue Investing Can Fall Out of Favor for Long Stretches\n\t\t      Still, I prefer to buy things when they\u2019re cheap. I probably read too much Benjamin Graham at an impressionable age, so now that\u2019s just how I\u2019m wired. You may have a different style, and that\u2019s great. The important thing is to know what it is. Step 1: Define Your Time HorizonThe stalwart Mark has opted to rent for life. I\u2019m not so resolute\u2014I do happen to be in the position of wanting to own a home some day, if only to taste the freedom of getting to choose a paint color other than \u201cFrench Gray.\u201d But when is some day? For any investment decision I make, the time horizon is the starting point of my personal flow chart.Practically, my entry point would be the same as most other urbanites\u2014a starter condo. Let\u2019s say I want to buy a condo at a $500,000 price point, which is slightly below the median price of my area, but I like round numbers. I\u2019ve squirreled enough away for a 20% down payment on that amount, which means I\u2019d borrow $400,000.Based on a casual survey of my older peers, a starter condo would probably last my husband and me about five years. After that, life starts to get in the way\u2014more dogs, more books, more camping gear, all clamoring for a fixed amount of square footage. Eventually, it becomes time to move on. As far as time horizons go, five years is pretty short. The average American spends 13.2 years in their home. Let\u2019s assume I take out a mortgage at an interest rate of 7.6%. Holding home prices constant, by September 2028, I will have notched away an extra 5.3% of equity in my home. (Fear not, we\u2019ll get to return potential in a minute.)\n\t\t\tHome Equity Accrues Slowly in Early Stages of Homeownership\n\t\t      Step 2: Identify the Opportunity SetThis is a highly variable analysis based on a lot of factors that are unique to me. With so many levers to pull, people (read: pushy relatives) tend to probe at the boundaries of your investment universe: What if you put more money down, what if you bought somewhere other than Chicago, what if you bought fewer lattes, what if you stayed in the condo for a few more years\u2014if, if, if.The choices are overwhelming. Know that I\u2019ve run through other scenarios, too. To escape the decision paralysis, today we\u2019re going to just focus on this one investment opportunity. A $500,000 condo within city limits, with 80% leverage and an exit after five years. That\u2019s my opportunity set. It\u2019s probably not yours! Being in the position of even considering a starter condo already makes me wildly fortunate relative to my peers with higher debt burdens. I hope you find this exercise useful anyway.Step 3: Establish Your Risk ToleranceThe third step on my personal flow chart is to establish my risk tolerance, given my time horizon and opportunity set. I am comfortable taking informed risks over long time horizons, like investing heavily in stocks for retirement while I\u2019m still early in my career. But when it comes to shorter-term investing decisions, I am a nervous Nellie. Tail risks aren\u2019t just theory for me: As a middle schooler during the 2008 financial crisis, I watched as my college savings went up in smoke. I need to have a very high degree of confidence because I know firsthand the pain of starting from scratch.My threshold becomes even higher when I consider the mechanics of a home purchase from a lending perspective. In investing, leverage is a powerful tool best used sparingly. The statutory limits for a \u201840 Act mutual fund are 33.3% of overall fund assets. That means that for every $1 million in assets under management, a fund can borrow $333,333 to increase its buying capacity.Meanwhile, everyone considers it normal that homes are purchased with 80% leverage\u2014if not more. For a $1 million home, an investor can borrow $800,000. Yes, the mechanics are very different. But I still think this is kind of wild! For me, it means I need to be extra sure that I\u2019m making the right choice.Step 4: Conduct a Valuation AssessmentNext, I\u2019m going to tally the expenses, which for homes tend to multiply like rabbits. I\u2019ve tried to highlight the most salient ones, but I don\u2019t think this is an exhaustive list by any means.I am probably going to spend at least 1%, or $5,000, a year on maintenance costs. (That expense merely staves off decline; it doesn\u2019t include improvements to increase property value.)I\u2019ll fork over another $2,900 in insurance costs.I live in a major metro, which means HOA fees will run me somewhere around $4,200 annually.I live in Chicago, long an outlier in terms of property taxes. They\u2019re going to set me back $11,000 per year.When I sell my property, I\u2019ll probably pay a \u201cback-end load\u201d in the form of closing fees, which are around 8% of the sale price in my area. For the sake of this analysis, I\u2019ll spread that out over five years so that it is $8,000 per year.Holy smokes. $31,100 is already far more than what I pay in rent each year.Then there\u2019s the interest expenses. Early on in a mortgage, they\u2019re high. If I sell my condo in five years, I will have made a total of $169,547 in mortgage payments. The portion of those payments that go to interest is $148,300, which leaves a paltry $21,582 for principal payments. First-time buyers in this market\u2014I feel your pain.\n\t\t\tIn Early Years, Vast Majority of Monthly Payments Go Toward Interest\n\t\t      Interest expenses aren\u2019t all bad, though, because they generate income tax deductions that can be significant. Everybody\u2019s tax situation is unique, but in the 22% tax bracket (2 times the average household income of Chicago), I could deduct $30,300 in interest payments and $10,000 in property taxes from my income. That\u2019s around $40,300 in tax deductions. Adjusting for the standard deduction that\u2019s available to all taxpayers ($27,700), I could save an extra $2,800 a year. That brings my expenses down to $28,300.If $28,300 was an expense ratio on a mutual fund, it\u2019d be around 5.7% of total net assets. That\u2019s a pretty lousy value proposition when I could just keep my overall costs lower and buy an index fund for free.However, there\u2019s one final sweetener. Unlike an index fund, residential real estate almost always appreciates in value above and beyond home equity, which is why leverage is so normalized.Ilyce Glink: The State of the U.S. Residential Real Estate MarketEven though Chicago has been in population decline since the 1950s, it has still seen the value of its properties go up by about 3.8% since the year 2000. (That return goes up to 5.8% if you venture out into greener pastures like San Francisco and Seattle.) If my home appreciates by the usual amount, it would be worth $601,400 by the time I go to sell it. That means that I would earn $222,982 on my total contributions of $121,582 for a 9.9% internal rate of return. Leverage is neat!\n\t\t\tReturn on Investment Heavily Dependent on Sale Price\n\t\t      That illustration rests on a key assumption, though, one that I don\u2019t hold. I do not assume that the returns that prevailed over the past 23 years are going to hold true over the next five. That\u2019s the real sticking point. If I was going to stay in my home for 10 years, or 13.2, or 30, my calculus would be different. But it\u2019s not.This is the chart that I can\u2019t get out of my head. This is where my internal Benjamin Graham starts whispering in my ear.\n\t\t\t2020s Do Not Obey Linear Relationship Between Mortgage Rates and Home Prices\n\t\t      On the y-axis is the Case-Shiller Index for the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is an aggregation of home price values indexed to the year 2000. On the x-axis, we have the prevailing interest rate, courtesy of the Saint Louis FRED.When interest rates are low, prices are high. When interest rates rise, prices fall. Either way, the monthly payment that Chicagoans make when they enter into a new mortgage obeys the laws of gravity. Those two big dots, way up high in the chart, taunting Newton? Those are the years 2022 and 2023.There\u2019s a simple explanation. Home prices are not responding to interest rates as they normally would because buyers are flush with cash and sellers are scarce. That throws the relationship between interest rates and the prices of Chicago home values out of whack. It does not, however, make them any cheaper.So What?How the housing affordability question gets resolved remains an open question. Interest rates could come down, making a monthly payment more affordable. Even better for first-time buyers, home prices could go down, making for a cheaper entry point. It need not take a global financial crisis to unwind. New construction could ramp up to meet existing demand, altering the mix of Chicago\u2019s housing stock and increasing affordability overall.Could it be the case that it doesn\u2019t get resolved at all, and Americans continue to pay ever-higher prices for a place to live? Aussies like Mark would say they sure can. These events are out of my control. What I can control is my peace of mind.Simply put, for me today, the math ain\u2019t mathing. I have a low degree of confidence that the current return environment for residential real estate in my area will continue to prevail over the next five years, and that makes me unwilling to take a highly leveraged bet on a single asset. I have no qualms about sitting tight and aging out of the starter condo market, at which point the personal economics (not to mention the emotions!) of a home purchase change. I\u2019m a long-term investor, and for the largest asset I will ever own, I don\u2019t mind the idea of being in it for the long haul.Your math may be entirely different from mine. In fact, I hope it is. Everybody\u2019s investment philosophy is as unique as their fingerprint and formed by their lived experience. I sleep better at night knowing that I have listened to the Benjamin Graham inside my head. You probably don\u2019t have a Benjamin Graham inside your head\u2014lucky you. For something as personal as a home, there\u2019s no right or wrong approach. But there is great power in self-awareness.Correction (Sept. 20, 2023): In the calculation of income tax deductions, a previous version of this article didn\u2019t account for the tax benefits of the standard deduction.","Article Anthor":"Madeline Hume","Article Date":1694995200000}
{"Article Title":"A Crucial Tipping Point for Bond Investors to Keep in Mind","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/crucial-tipping-point-bond-investors-keep-mind","Article Content":"After years of sleepwalking along at modest levels, bond yields and the markets that trade them have jolted awake. Dogged inflation and a surprisingly durable economic recovery have pushed the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by more than 5 percentage points since the current hiking cycle began 18 months ago, plunging bond markets into uncharted waters.\n\t\t\tRate Hike Cycles, 1983-2023\n\t\t      Investors have been caught in the whipsaw. The 10-Year U.S. Treasury Bond, one of the most closely watched bond benchmarks, has seen its yield spike from 1.7% as of February 2022 to 4.1% as of August 2023\u2014the first time it crossed 4% since the global financial crisis. (Yields rise when prices fall, so the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF IEF lost 14.6% over that stretch.)There are a few rules of thumb that are helpful for bond investors to take note of when navigating choppy markets like this one. One has laid dormant in the fixed-income markets for nearly 15 years: a concept known as escape velocity. This concept is a useful one but requires dusting off.What is Escape Velocity?Higher bond yields realign the risks that investors should emphasize when choosing what bonds to invest in. When yields are low, that means bond prices are not discounted very much relative to the face value of the bond (effectively the amount of the loan). With a lower price cushion, the risk of capital losses\u2014that is, bond prices falling owing to a subsequent rise in market rates\u2014is high. That makes a bond more attuned to shifts in the prevailing interest rate, all else equal. Duration is a way of expressing this relationship mathematically. It has a few ingredients: the face value of the bond, the coupon rate, the prevailing market interest rate, and years to maturity. By discounting the cash flows back to today, duration gives you an approximate measure of a bond\u2019s sensitivity to interest-rate movements, given its starting yield. A good rule is that you can expect a bond to rise or fall by its modified duration, which is denominated in years, for every 1 percentage point move up or down in interest rates. We can illustrate this concept with a hypothetical $1,000 plain-vanilla bond that matures in 10 years and pays out an annual coupon of 4%.\n\t\t\tRising Yields Mean Lower Durations\n\t\t      For most of the past 15 years, Treasury bond investors operated in an environment where yield was extremely hard to find\u2014not too dissimilar from the first two rows in this table. As evidenced by the table, lower yields modestly extend a bond\u2019s duration, creating a slightly bumpier ride for bond investors.In those types of situations, it\u2019s almost always true that a high-quality government bond\u2019s duration is greater than yield to maturity, which means that bond investors can expect a negative nominal return as rates rise. Take the example of a bond priced at par, found in Row 2 in the table above. If rates rise after the bond is bought, the fall in price offsets the coupon and the investor loses money.\n\t\t\tPerformance of a Hypothetical Bond at 4% Yield to Maturity\n\t\t      Bummer, right? But as interest rates start to creep up, that no longer has to be the case. The north and south poles of bond investing invert: Yields rise, and bond prices fall. If the conditions are just right, yields can actually overtake duration. That\u2019s where escape velocity comes in, and stuff starts to get really weird.How Does It Work?Let\u2019s take the example of the bond in the bottom row of the table above. If rates start at 10% instead of 4%, an investor would pay $631 upfront instead of $1,000. If rates rise by 1 percentage point, the bond\u2019s duration of 7.2 means it will lose roughly 7.2% of its value\u2014not fun. However, an investor still has a margin of safety: $632 is a lot cheaper than $1,000, and they still have the same amount of coupons coming in the door, and time has passed, which brings the investor a year closer to their bond maturing.\n\t\t\tPerformance of an Identical Bond at 10% Yield to Maturity\n\t\t      Inclusive of all of those levers, one can expect that over a calendar year the gears of bond math will overturn the initial price decline and an investor will end up with a positive nominal return of 3.3%. This math holds over the entire life of the bond, which means rates can rise to almost 19% and the investor will still end up with a positive return.\n\t\t\tTime value of Money Outweighs Rising Yields as a Bond Approaches Maturity\n\t\t      Which Bonds Have Reached Escape Velocity?It varies from bond to bond, but generally speaking short-term bonds with a duration of less than three years are the only bonds that are currently at escape velocity in aggregate.\n\t\t\tOnly Short-Term Bonds Have Reached Escape Velocity\n\t\t      That means that for investors who own bonds in this bucket, the direction of rates generally doesn\u2019t affect the price of their investments enough to outweigh the margin of safety gifted by the time value of money. Investors can make enough for the next several years from the coupons they receive, boosted by the passage of time, that it doesn\u2019t matter quite so much whether the bond market itself is in the red or in the black. However, it also means that most bond investors are still toeing the line between current bond yields and future interest-rate changes. What can they take away from this tipping point?ConclusionsIn the current interest-rate environment, escape velocity indicates that short-term bonds are on sale. Investors have fled the asset class in droves, hollowing out that bond market segment in favor of a barbell of shorter-term securities like money market funds, which have even higher yields, and bonds with a longer time horizon, which offer more certainty.It\u2019s not hard to figure out why. Don\u2019t fight the Fed, as the saying goes. John Rekenthaler discussed in his column just yesterday that long-term bonds have merit for investors who are confident that the Fed is close to finished with its current hiking cycle, as it has suggested. Meanwhile, cash-like instruments are going for an even deeper discount than short-term bonds are, providing all the income that some investors need to satisfy near-term goals. All along the yield curve, investors are bracing for the impact of impending rate cuts. But they are flocking to extremes in the process, and yield curve timing is a complicated art. Escape velocity suggests that there may be some value\u2014or even more surprisingly, some peace of mind\u2014to be had in the messy middle.        3 Top Stocks for the Next 10 Years   Watch","Article Anthor":"Madeline Hume","Article Date":1693872000000}
{"Article Title":"How to Use Cash in a Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/how-use-cash-portfolio","Article Content":"Should you have cash in your portfolio? It depends. Many investors don\u2019t need to load up on cash if they\u2019re saving for long-term goals, but cash plays a critical role for retirees and other investors with shorter-term spending needs.In this series on portfolio basics, I\u2019ll explain some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Is Cash?Cash doesn\u2019t only refer to the bills in your wallet. The term is broadly used to describe not just hard currency but other safe, liquid holdings such as Treasury bills, money market funds, and bank accounts.There are a lot of these assets out there. Based on the most recent quarterly report from the Federal Reserve, U.S. households own about $4.2 trillion in checking accounts and U.S. currency, $9.5 trillion in savings accounts and short-term instruments, and $3.2 trillion in money market funds. If you added in assets held by corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations, those totals would be even higher.What Role Should Cash Play in Your Portfolio?What Are the Advantages and Risks of Holding Cash?Cash has two main advantages: safety and liquidity. The U.S. dollar is perceived as a safe asset because while it\u2019s not backed by any physical assets, it\u2019s supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Outside of the United States, the U.S. dollar is a major reserve currency, meaning large amounts of dollars are held by central banks and major financial institutions to use for international transactions. Because the U.S. dollar plays such a key role in the global economy, it\u2019s generally considered to be a reliable store of value globally. Cash is also safe because it essentially never loses value, at least in nominal terms. Moreover, cash is the most liquid asset. You can easily spend U.S. dollars. You can also easily access cashlike assets, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market funds, to make purchases, asset transfers, and debt payments.This safety comes at a price: lower returns. As shown in the chart below, cash has both the lowest risk and the lowest returns of any major asset class over time.\n\t\t\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: Cash and Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Because cash has no potential for capital appreciation, returns on cash are driven by yield. Over the past 40 years or so, yields on the three-month Treasury bill have ranged from a high of 16.3% in May 1981 to a low of 0.5% in October 2021.After the Federal Reserve made a series of aggressive interest-rate hikes starting in early 2022, the target federal-funds rate has increased by more than 500 basis points. (More on how this works in the next section.) As a result, the three-month Treasury bill yield had reached 5.31% as of Aug. 24, 2023, which was actually higher than the most recent inflation number over the past 12 months.\n\t\t\t3-Month Treasury Bill Yield Since 1954\n\t\t      Source: https:\/\/fredhelp.stlouisfed.org. Data as of June 30, 2023. But holding cash isn\u2019t usually a good way to stay ahead of inflation, as shown in the table below. Because yields on short-term securities have been so low (until recently), annualized returns for cash have fallen behind inflation over most of these trailing periods. That said, returns on cash have edged slightly ahead of inflation if you look at the entire 96\u00bd-year period between January 1926 and now.\n\t\t\tAnnualized Returns for Cash vs. Inflation (%)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. When Does Cash Perform Best?As mentioned above, yield is the main driver of cash returns. The yield on cash is partly driven by Federal Reserve policy since the target federal-funds range sets the rate for overnight bank lending, which in turn has a major impact on borrowing costs and overall financial conditions. As a result, the federal-funds rate indirectly affects short-term interest rates for cash and other securities. However, current yields on short-term Treasuries and other cashlike assets also reflect the market\u2019s expectations for future inflation and interest rates. Some of the most generous periods for cash returns were in the 1970s and 1980s, but those periods were also marked by above-average inflation.\n\t\t\tAnnualized Returns for Cash and Inflation by Decade (%)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How Long Should I Plan to Hold On to My Cash Assets?Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework considers cash to be the only suitable asset for holding periods of 12 months or less. If you have a spending need coming up a bit further out, such as within one to two years, cash might also be the best parking spot.And it\u2019s always important to keep some cash on hand to cover unexpected emergencies, such as job loss, car repair, appliance replacement, and so on. Most financial advisors recommend keeping at least six to 12 months\u2019 worth of living expenses in cash as an emergency fund\u2014even if you don\u2019t end up spending it right away.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Cash?The answer to this question largely depends on your life stage. If you\u2019re many years away from retirement, you don\u2019t need to allocate much to cash, assuming you already have an emergency fund set aside, as well as enough liquid assets to cover any short-term spending needs. Setting aside cash gets more important as you get closer to retirement age. Financial advisors typically recommend that retirees keep at least one to two years\u2019 worth of expenses in cash or other low-risk assets. The reason? Holding cash gives you a ready source of liquidity for short-term spending and means you don\u2019t have to sell stocks or bonds when the market is down.Where\u2019s the Best Place to Stash My Cash?The table below shows some of the pros and cons of various ways to hold cash.\n\t\t\tWhere To Keep Your Cash\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar. What Funds Pair Well With Cash?If you\u2019ve already set up sufficient cash reserves, a U.S. large-cap stock fund, international-stock fund, or a bond fund could be a logical addition.U.S. large-cap stock funds: These funds are a key foundation for nearly every investor\u2019s portfolio. They\u2019ve produced outstanding total returns over time and are one of the best ways to generate wealth for long-term financial goals. As mentioned above, U.S. stocks currently make up about 60% of global market capitalization, so we consider them core holdings that could make up the majority of a portfolio\u2019s equity exposure.International-stock funds: Stocks located in markets outside the U.S. currently make up about 40% of the global market based on the value of shares outstanding. That makes them worth owning for the sake of getting more complete exposure to equity markets around the world. International stocks can also provide diversification benefits (especially as a hedge against weakness in the U.S. dollar) and exposure to leading companies outside the U.S.Bond funds: These funds typically help buffer against losses in years when the stock market is down (although rising interest rates and unexpectedly high inflation led to sharp losses for both stocks and bonds in 2022). Bond funds have also often had negative correlations with the equity market, which can help improve risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds.Should I Hold Cash in My Portfolio?You should hold some cash, but it\u2019s not really an investment asset because of its lack of growth potential. That means that you can think of your cash holdings separately\u2014not as a core component of your investment portfolio. While the generous yields currently available on cash may be tempting, keep in mind that it doesn\u2019t generate enough growth to help fuel long-term capital appreciation.Correction (Aug. 29, 2023): A previous version of this article stated that the 40-year high yield on the three-month Treasury bill was 15.1% in September 2021.

If you already have exposure to U.S. large-cap stocks, international stocks could be a logical addition thanks to their potential to improve portfolio diversification.In this series on portfolio basics, I\u2019ll explain some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\u2019ll start with some of the most widely used types of investments and walk through what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are International Stocks?For investors who live in the United States, stocks of companies based in other countries are considered international stocks. International-stock funds can focus on developed markets (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan), emerging markets (such as China, India, or Brazil), or a combination of both.As of July 2023, non-U.S. stocks made up about 40% of global market capitalization. Because international stocks make up a significant portion of the available equity market, it makes sense for most investors to have some exposure to international stocks. Most international stocks are denominated in non-U.S. currencies and trade on exchanges in their local markets. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor\u2019s stock is denominated in the new Taiwan dollar and trades on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, and Finland-based Nordea bank trades in the Danish krone on Nasdaq Copenhagen.The exception: American depositary receipts, or ADRs, which are certificates issued by a U.S. bank that represent ownership in foreign companies. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars and trade on U.S. stock exchanges.What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in International Stocks?International stocks have two main advantages: diversification and the potential to perform better than U.S. stocks over certain periods. In the past, non-U.S. stocks have had relatively low correlations with their U.S. stock counterparts, leading to better risk-adjusted returns for a globally diversified portfolio. As the economy has become increasingly global, though, U.S. and non-U.S. stocks have started moving more in tandem over the past couple of decades.There have also been certain periods, such as the early 1970s, late 1980s, and 2002 through mid-2008, when international stocks have fared better than their U.S. counterparts. These periods often correspond to periods when the U.S. dollar was weak: Stronger non-U.S. currencies mean that investors in international stocks come out ahead when their returns are translated back to U.S. dollars. More recently, however, international stocks have fallen behind, partly because of how the U.S. dollar has strengthened over the past 10 years or so.Along with their return potential, international stocks come with certain risks, including the impact of currency movements, political conflicts, and weaker accounting standards. This means that international stocks come with relatively high risks and returns. The table below shows annualized returns and standard deviations for international stocks in developed and emerging markets compared with other major asset classes over the past 20 years.\n\t\t\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: Cash and Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Historically, international stocks have lost as much as 50% or more during market drawdowns, such as the global financial crisis that started in late 2007 and the coronavirus-driven bear market in early 2020. On a quarterly basis, they\u2019ve been subject to losses as large as 20% or more. Like other stocks, however, international stocks go up more often than they go down\u2014helping them generate rewarding returns over time.\n\t\t\tOther Risk and Drawdown Stats (Since 1990)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How to Invest in International StocksThere are two main ways to invest in international stocks: by purchasing individual stocks or by purchasing a fund. Buying international stocks on local exchanges would probably be impractical for most individual investors. As mentioned above, ADRs are another more accessible option for purchasing individual foreign stocks. There are about 430 ADRs currently traded on major exchanges in the U.S., plus about 2,000 more that trade over the counter.But buying individual stocks also comes with additional risks. If you own one stock (or even as many as 20 different stocks), you\u2019ll be subject to stock-specific risk\u2014meaning that the odds of things going poorly are much higher than they would be with a diversified portfolio. In 2021, for example, nearly one out of every three ADRs lost 10% or more, even though non-U.S. stocks as a whole gained about 8% for the year.For most investors, broadly diversified index funds are the best way to invest in international stocks. Few active managers have been able to consistently outperform the overall market over time. Index funds, on the other hand, harness the market\u2019s collective wisdom about the relative value of each stock included in a given benchmark. They\u2019re also cheaper: Investors in actively managed international-stock funds pony up annual expenses of about 1%, on average, but the typical index fund costs less than half of that.If you only own one international-stock fund, I\u2019d focus on the foreign large-blend Morningstar Category rather than more specialized areas. The foreign large-blend category typically provides the broadest exposure to the overall market, and it isn\u2019t as subject to market swings that can cause growth, value, or region-specific funds to go in and out of favor over multiyear periods. Global large-blend funds can also be a good option if you want to get exposure to U.S. and non-U.S. stocks in a single package.When Do International Stocks Perform Best?Like all stocks, international stocks typically perform best during periods of strong economic growth, rising corporate profits, declining interest rates, and low inflation.As mentioned above, international stocks also usually fare best during periods of U.S. dollar weakness. The table below shows annualized returns for international stocks during some of their strongest periods.\n\t\t\tAnnualized Returns During the Best Times for International Stocks\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How Long Should I Hold My Investments in Large-Cap Stocks?Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework recommends holding international-stock funds for at least 10 years. We came up with this guideline partly by looking at the historical frequency of losses over various rolling time periods ranging from one year to 10 years. We also considered the maximum time to recovery, or how long it usually takes to recover after a drawdown.How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in International Stocks?There\u2019s no easy answer to this question.Some people argue that you don\u2019t need separate exposure to international stocks at all, given that many leading companies in the U.S. earn a significant portion of their revenue from overseas. Vanguard founder Jack Bogle was famously skeptical about the value of international investing, arguing that non-U.S. companies can\u2019t keep pace with those in the U.S. based on innovation, productivity, technological advancement, and shareholder protection.On the other hand, skipping out on international stocks would mean missing out on some of the world\u2019s leading companies, such as Nestle SA, Samsung Electronics, and Novo Nordisk. Plus, international stocks can generate better returns at times when the U.S. might be struggling. And as mentioned above, international stocks currently make up about 40% of the market\u2019s overall capitalization globally.So, we maintain that most investors should probably have some type of exposure to non-U.S. stocks.We consider foreign large-blend funds to be core holdings that could make up as much as 40% to 80% of a portfolio\u2019s assets, although most investors will probably want to keep their exposure on the lower end of that range.Foreign large-growth and foreign large-value funds fill more specialized roles; we consider them \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that could make up as much as 15% to 40% of a portfolio\u2019s assets. Because of the higher risk inherent in emerging markets or region-specific funds, we recommend limiting them to 15% of assets or less.What Are the Best International-Stock Funds?The table below shows a subset of highly rated index funds dedicated to international stocks. I\u2019ve focused on international-stock funds that are broadly available through major brokerage platforms, with low investment minimums and ultralow expense ratios.\n\t\t\tHighly Rated International-Stock Funds (Index Funds)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct.

(The only asset that comes anywhere close is oil, although the price history of the Dow Jones Crude Oil Index only goes back to 2015.)\n\t\t\tRolling One-Year Volatility of Bitcoin Exceeds Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Even though bitcoin has performed favorably since the last time we examined bitcoin\u2019s impact on the 60\/40 in 2021, its returns are still nearly 4 times as volatile as those of a balanced fund. That means that even a smidge of bitcoin changes the behavior of an investor\u2019s portfolio a whole lot.How Much Is a Lot?Let\u2019s say that in August 2013 a hypothetical investor added a 2% allocation to bitcoin to a costless 60\/40 portfolio\u2014that\u2019s $20 in bitcoin for every $1,000 invested. (For the purposes of this example, let\u2019s also assume the investor furnished that $20 investment from their bond portfolio, although it doesn\u2019t change the results much whether that money comes from stocks or bonds. We also rebalanced this portfolio on a monthly basis\u2014that will become important in a second.)Our study found that a 2% sliver of bitcoin reshaped the return profile of their portfolio nearly as much as adding a 10% stake in stocks would have: A 60%\/38%\/2% split between stocks\/bonds\/bitcoin yielded a standard deviation of 10.7 over the past 10 years, in line with how a 70%\/30% S&P 500\/Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond portfolio would have behaved.\n\t\t\tBitcoin Alters Standard Deviations Far More Than Additional Stock Exposure\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Further up the risk spectrum, a portfolio with a 5% stake in bitcoin had a risk profile closer to a 90\/10 portfolio than a 60\/40. In fact, if that hypothetical portfolio was a fund, adding bitcoin would have easily pushed it out of the moderate allocation Morningstar Category to which most balanced funds belong. The closest match among allocation categories is the aggressive allocation category, meaning that the portfolio leapfrogged the moderately aggressive allocation category altogether. (Meanwhile, any portfolio with a 10% allocation or more to bitcoin courted more risk than the S&P 500 on its own!) Decomposing that risk reveals even more. Effectively, a 1% allocation to bitcoin has a negligible effect on risk, either in terms of absolute volatility or relative contribution. But a 2% allocation to bitcoin explains close to 15% of a portfolio\u2019s overall volatility, a much heftier contribution. Meanwhile, a 5% allocation accounts for nearly 45% of the return volatility the portfolio experienced, and overall volatility was meaningfully higher.\n\t\t\tBitcoin's Relative Contribution to Risk Increases With Additional Exposure\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Although adding bitcoin does open up the risk throttle on these hypothetical portfolios, it\u2019s worth pointing out that investors would have been fairly compensated for doing so. A costless 60\/40 portfolio would have turned in a Sharpe ratio (a return metric that accounts for risk) of roughly 0.77 over the past decade. Each portfolio that contains bitcoin improves upon that result, although incremental improvements peak at a 5% slice.\n\t\t\tBitcoin Has Compensated Investors for Additional Risk\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. With that being said, our portfolios were crafted using a fairly narrow set of assumptions that aren\u2019t likely to hold in practice. That\u2019s because regulators in the United States have barred most brokerages from offering bitcoin alongside traditional stock and bond investments. Most digital assets are quarantined in a separate wallet or exchange account, which makes it tedious for investors to rebalance on a monthly cadence like we did in our study. Whether because of inertia or mental accounting or both, many investors opt not to rebalance at all.When it comes to security selection\u2014picking individual stocks, for example\u2014the \u201cDo Nothing\u201d approach may have some merit. But when it comes to asset allocation, there are consequences to portfolio neglect. For example, a 1% allocation to bitcoin (funded proportionally from stocks and bonds this time, to replicate the experience of segregating assets) can quickly spiral into a 60% allocation if investors fail to reap what they\u2019ve sown.\n\t\t\tFailing to Rebalance Has Significant Consequences for an Investor's Asset Allocation\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Even one annual rebalance makes a world of difference. There are some edge cases, like 2013 and 2017, where the allocation to bitcoin would have climbed above 5%. But mostly it plods along somewhere between 1% and 2%. For only 15 months out of the entire 10-year holding period does the portfolio overtake that 2% threshold where the portfolio experiences volatility that\u2019s out of spec with the risk profile of a 60\/40 portfolio.\n\t\t\tAnnual Rebalances Partially Succeed in Keeping Allocation to Bitcoin in Check\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. While the SEC weighs proposals that might broaden investor access to bitcoin by way of an exchange-traded fund, we see a marginal benefit to existing owners of digital assets who would have an easier time trying to rebalance this high-octane holding if it\u2019s permitted to live alongside their traditional investments. But without the investor protections that other asset classes provide, we continue to advise that investors treat purchases of digital assets (including bitcoin) as a sunk cost rather than an investable asset.Even so, there are investors who fall somewhere in between these two extremes and treat bitcoin as something more than a sunk cost but less than a full-blown portfolio holding. I would advise those investors to tread cautiously. Like caviar or dynamite, a little bit of bitcoin goes a long way.

{"Article Title":"How Do I Use Large-Cap Stocks in a Portfolio?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/how-do-i-use-large-cap-stocks-portfolio","Article Content":"What should be in your portfolio? The specifics will depend on several factors, such as your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance, but large-cap stocks are a good choice for inclusion in nearly every investor\u2019s portfolio.In this series on portfolio basics, I\u2019ll explore some of the fundamentals of putting together sound portfolios. I\u2019ll examine the most widely used types of investments and what you need to know to use them effectively in a portfolio.Portfolio Basics: How to Build an Investment PortfolioWhat Are Large-Cap Stocks?Large-cap stocks are defined based on their market capitalization (also known as market cap), which measures the total value of a stock\u2019s shares outstanding, or the number of shares that are publicly traded multiplied by the current stock price.Morningstar defines a stock as large-cap if it lands within the top 70% of aggregate market capitalization for a given market, such as the United States, Europe, or Canada. (Currently, stocks with market caps of about $12.8 billion or more qualify as large-cap.) Stocks with larger market caps tend to be widely recognizable names, such as Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon.com AMZN. By definition, large-cap stocks make up the majority of the available market, so it makes sense that they should make up a significant portion of most investors\u2019 total equity exposure.What Are the Advantages and Risks of Investing in Large-Cap Stocks?Large-cap stocks have several advantages. Because they\u2019re widely held by so many investors, they\u2019re extensively researched and liquid. Their sheer size means their performance is generally a pretty good gauge of the equity market overall.As shown in the chart below, large-cap stocks have generated strong returns over time. Over the 97 years since 1926, small-cap stocks have fared even better, with an annualized performance edge of about 1.5 percentage points per year. However, large-cap stocks have outperformed in more recent periods, such as the 14-year timespan following the global financial crisis.\n\t\t\tGrowth of $1 Over Time\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Along with their return potential, stocks come with certain risks. In contrast to bonds, which offer more certainty about their value at maturity, stocks are inherently riskier. And while bondholders receive periodic interest payments (typically at a set rate) in exchange for lending money to the bond issuer, the value of a stock is both difficult to model and constantly changing. This means that large-cap stocks come with relatively high risks and returns. The table below shows annualized returns and standard deviations for large-cap stocks compared with other major asset classes over the past 20 years.\n\t\t\tTrailing 20-Year Risk and Return: U.S. Large-Cap Stocks and Other Assets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Historically, large-cap stocks have lost as much as 50% or more during market drawdowns, such as the global financial crisis that started in late 2007 and the tech stock correction that started in 2000. On a quarterly basis, they\u2019ve been subject to losses as large as 20% or more. That said, large-cap stocks go up more often than they go down\u2014helping them generate rewarding returns over time.\n\t\t\tOther Risk and Drawdown Stats (Since 1990)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. How to Invest in Large-Cap StocksThere are two main ways to invest in large-cap stocks: by purchasing individual stocks or by purchasing a fund.Buying individual stocks isn\u2019t as hard as it used to be, as many brokerage firms now offer commission-free trades as well as fractional shares, which allow investors to buy smaller slices of a given stock if they don\u2019t have the assets available to cover the full share price.But buying individual stocks also comes with additional risks. If you own one stock (or even as many as 20 different stocks), you\u2019ll be subject to stock-specific risk\u2014meaning that the odds of things going poorly are much higher than they would be with a diversified portfolio. In 2021, for example, about 1 out of every 6 large-cap stocks lost 10% or more, even though the overall market generated positive total returns of about 26% for the year. For most investors, broadly diversified index funds are the best way to invest in large-cap stocks. Few active managers have been able to consistently outperform the overall market over time. Index funds, on the other hand, harness the market\u2019s collective wisdom about the relative value of each stock included in a given benchmark. They\u2019re also cheaper: Investors in actively managed large-cap stock funds pony up annual expenses of about 88 basis points, on average, but the typical passively managed large-cap stock fund charges less than half of that.If you only own one large-cap stock fund, I\u2019d focus on large-cap blend rather than large value or large growth. Large-cap blend typically provides the broadest exposure to the overall market, and isn\u2019t as subject to market vicissitudes that can cause growth and value stocks to swing in and out of favor over multiyear periods.When Do Large-Cap Stocks Perform Best?Large-cap stocks typically perform best during periods of strong economic growth, rising corporate profits, declining interest rates, and low inflation. The table below shows annualized returns for large-cap stocks during several recent bull markets.\n\t\t\tReturns for Large-Cap Stocks in Recent Bull Markets\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. Total returns are annualized. How Long Should I Hold My Investments in Large-Cap Stocks?Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio Framework recommends holding stock funds for at least 10 years. We came up with this guideline partly by looking at the historical frequency of losses over various rolling time periods ranging from one year to 10 years.The idea is to minimize the odds that an investment is in the red at the same time that you need to access the money to fund a goal.Over a five-year period, for example, returns for large-blend and large-growth funds have been negative about 18% of the time. Over a 10-year period, the odds of incurring a loss are significantly lower.\n\t\t\tFrequency of Losses Over Rolling Periods Since 1990\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of Dec. 31, 2022. Numbers in the headings indicate the length of the rolling period in years. Another way to think about this issue is by looking at the maximum time to recovery, or how long it typically takes for a given fund category to recover after suffering a drawdown. As shown in the table below, large-blend and large-value funds have historically recovered within about six years. Large-growth funds have taken as long as 13 years to win back their losses after a market downturn.\n\t\t\tMaximum Time to Recovery for Large-Cap Stock Categories Since 1990\n\t\t      How Much of My Portfolio Should Be in Large-Cap Stocks?The answer to this question largely depends on your portfolio\u2019s overall asset mix.If you\u2019re investing for a short-term (less than two years) or intermediate-term goal (two to six years), you\u2019ll probably want to tilt your portfolio more toward cash and bonds. If your time horizon is long enough, however, a larger stock allocation may make more sense.Within the equity portion of a portfolio, it makes sense to use the overall composition of the market as a starting point. Large-cap stocks account for more than 70% of the market\u2019s overall market capitalization; as a result, they\u2019re generally a good proxy for the performance of stocks in general.That\u2019s particularly true for large-blend funds, which we recommend as core holdings that could make up as much as 40% to 80% of a portfolio\u2019s assets. Large-value and large-growth funds fill more specialized roles; we consider them \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that could make up as much as 15% to 40% of a portfolio\u2019s assets.What Are the Best Large-Cap Stock Funds?The table below shows a subset of highly rated index funds focusing on large-cap stocks. I\u2019ve focused on large-cap blend funds that are broadly available through major brokerage platforms, with low investment minimums and ultralow expense ratios.\n\t\t\tA Few Highly Rated Large-Cap Stock Funds (Index Funds)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of July 31, 2023. The list below includes a few actively managed funds from Russ Kinnel\u2019s \u201cThrilling 31\u2033 list, which features funds with relatively low expense ratios, high Morningstar Medalist ratings, portfolio managers who have invested at least $1 million in their own fund, and above-average returns during the manager\u2019s tenure for at least five years.\n\t\t\tA Few Highly Rated Large-Cap Stock Funds (Actively Managed Funds)\n\t\t      What Funds Pair Well with Large-Cap Stock Funds?If you\u2019ve already added a large-cap stock fund to your portfolio, a bond fund or international-stock fund could be a logical addition.Bond funds typically help buffer against losses in years when the stock market is down (although rising interest rates and unexpectedly high inflation led to sharp losses for both stocks and bonds in 2022). Bond funds have also often had negative correlations with the equity market, which can help improve risk-adjusted returns for a portfolio that includes both stocks and bonds.International-stock funds can provide more complete exposure to the global market. U.S. stocks currently make up about 60% of global market capitalization, but non-U.S. stocks account for the remaining 40%. And while correlations between U.S. and non-U.S. stocks have trended up over the past couple of decades, international stocks can offer diversification benefits. There are also certain periods in which international stocks have had a performance edge.Small-cap stock funds can also make a good complement to large-cap stock funds. They offer some diversification benefits and might enhance returns over longer periods. If you select a \u201ctotal market\u201d index fund, though, you probably don\u2019t need to add a separate small-cap stock fund. Most \u201ctotal market\u201d indexes provide broad exposure across the entire market-cap spectrum.Should I Invest in Large-Cap Stocks?As long as you have a long enough time horizon, large-cap stocks are a key foundation for nearly every investor\u2019s portfolio. They\u2019ve produced outstanding total returns over time, and are one of the best ways to generate wealth for long-term financial goals.","Article Anthor":"Amy Arnott","Article Date":1691366400000}
{"Article Title":"Are Younger Investors Too Conservative?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/are-younger-investors-too-conservative","Article Content":"Last month, my esteemed colleague John Rekenthaler weighed in on the question of whether older investors have become too aggressive, based on research Vanguard conducted on retirement savers in the defined-contribution plans it record-keeps for.To summarize, John took the view that, yes, some older investors are too aggressive. To be sure, the near-retirees that invest in their plan\u2019s default option typically do just fine. But, as John points out in his piece, roughly half of older investors can\u2019t resist the urge to tinker when left to their own devices.On the flip side, Vanguard also found that younger investors largely don\u2019t fall prey to the same temptation. More than 75% of investors under the age of 35 invest in a single target-date fund, which is generally considered the gold standard for retirement saving. What Is a Target-Date Fund, and Why Do Young Investors Love Them?A target-date fund is a multi-asset strategy that gradually shifts from stocks to bonds over the course of the investor\u2019s life. Typically, people buy or are defaulted into one through their 401(k), IRA, or health saving account and select the strategy that has a year that lines up with the year they expect to retire. Target-date funds\u2019 key feature is a \u201cglide path,\u201d which describes how the investment adjusts the proportion of retirement savings that are allocated to different asset classes over time. As the riskier asset, stocks are the primary engine of an investor\u2019s returns over the long run, so most target-date funds start with a generous helping of them before gliding to a much lower allocation later on.Target-date funds have soared in popularity as the default option for automatic enrollment in defined-contribution plans, and to some extent the uptick in adoption reflects plan sponsors steering younger investors into the vehicle. But a good chunk of them are opting into these strategies, too, which is a welcome development: Our research has found that target-date fund investors have tended to fare better than average, capturing more of the funds\u2019 total returns when compared with other types of funds.That said, Vanguard also found that the younger participants in its record-keeping plans were still investing only around 89% of their assets in stocks. That is pretty low, as the average longer-date target-date fund we track stakes around 93% in stocks, as shown in the chart below.\n\t\t\tVanguard's Average Investor Allocates Less to Stocks Than the Typical Target-Date Fund\n\t\t      It appears that the average young investor in a Vanguard record-keeping plan is underweight stocks relative to the typical target-date fund. It\u2019s a puzzling finding at first, but there are a few simple reasons why this could be. The first is that the \u201cHow America Saves\u201d methodology accounts for the dominance of the biggest target-date strategies, which are more conservative than the norm. (Morningstar does not take assets under management into account when defining the average target-date fund.) The two biggest target-date series\u2014Vanguard itself and Fidelity\u2014collectively command almost 50% of all target-date assets under management. Their glide paths start with 90% in stocks, a notch more cautious than the average target-date series.The other issue could be friction. Target-date managers can\u2019t always invest all the way up to their desired strategic glide path\u2014they need to keep some cash on hand to meet redemptions. Investors, too, may not be fully invested all the time. This is more of a problem for younger investors, whose contributions each month make up a significant portion of their overall balance.Whatever the reason, it appears that younger investors are slightly more conservative in their retirement plans than they ought to be. The question is whether that\u2019s a problem. Could It Have an Effect on Younger Investors\u2019 Retirement Savings?The short answer appears to be no.Target dates glide the way they do because they strike a balance between two sources of wealth: human capital and financial capital. Early on in their careers, young people may lack savings (that is, financial capital), but they boast future earnings potential (human capital).The best way for someone early on in their career to improve their retirement outlook is by, in effect, converting their human capital into financial capital. They do so by socking away a portion of each paycheck. As time wears on and those savings compound, the picture changes, with financial capital approaching and eventually exceeding human capital.What does that have to do with one\u2019s stock allocation? It\u2019s important to keep in mind that, until around age 35, contributions make up more than half of an investor\u2019s overall balance, with investment returns making up the rest. Given that, modest changes in an investor\u2019s asset allocation don\u2019t make a very big difference.\n\t\t\tUntil Age 35, Contributions Make Up More Than 50% of an Investor's Total Portfolio\n\t\t      An example might help to illustrate why this is so. Assume that stocks earn about 10% a year, while bonds print about 6%. If a young plan participant invested 5% more in stocks than they do in the average Vanguard target-date fund, they\u2019d theoretically take home an extra 0.2% each year. So, let\u2019s imagine it\u2019s a 22-year-old investor who earns an average salary today and experiences the normal level of salary growth (broken out by gender, given the differences in growth and trajectory) over the course of their career. How would that participant\u2019s ending balance vary if they began by allocating 89% to stocks versus 93%, contributed 10% of their take-home pay, and received a standard employer match?When we run the numbers, we find that upping the stock allocation would add about $50,000 to that 22-year-old\u2019s account balance by the time they retire. (All figures are nominal and assume a 4% inflation rate.)\n\t\t\tInvestors Could Earn Roughly $50,000 From 10 Years of Extra Stock Exposure\n\t\t      But that pales when compared with the benefits the 22-year-old participant would reap by nudging her contribution rate a bit higher. For instance, if that investor chipped in 11% of their salary instead of 10% for the first 10 years of their career, it could add more than $300,000 to their ultimate balance.\n\t\t\tBut for Younger Investors, Contributions Make a Much Greater Impact\n\t\t      In that sense, quibbling over the asset allocation kind of misses the point. For young investors, it\u2019s contribution rate, and not the stock\/bond mix, that really moves the needle when it comes to the size of one\u2019s retirement nest egg.On the Other Hand \u2026With a 40-year time horizon to play with, the consequences of a young investor sprinkling on some added risk are minimal. Investors are not as likely to make trades when they\u2019re invested in a target-date fund and are less likely to yank money out when their investments start to slump.Vanguard, of course, is aware of this. With respect to its target-date series, the firm argues that any risk above what\u2019s absolutely necessary to deliver on investors\u2019 retirement savings goals is unwise. Vanguard maintains a 10% exposure in bonds in order to temper volatility during downturns and favors higher contribution rates of 12%-15% to give investors the best chance of success. With contributions packing such a big punch, why court any more risk when stocks slide?Still, it\u2019s hard to argue against an extra dash of equity if you can stomach it. Like young investors, stocks have a great deal of potential: In the long run, they do deliver excess returns over bonds, all else equal. The road to get there might be bumpy, but every little bit counts. It may take lower fees, higher equity, or extra contributions for young investors to meet their ultimate retirement goal. Then again, it more than likely will take some combination of all three.","Article Anthor":"Madeline Hume","Article Date":1690848000000}
{"Article Title":"7 Things I Don\u2019t Own in My Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/7-things-i-dont-own-my-portfolio","Article Content":"As someone who writes about building portfolios for a living, I do research on many types of investments, ranging from tried-and-true core holdings to more-esoteric corners of the investment world. A key part of my job is to comb through the available evidence and help readers understand the pros and cons of various investment types for their own portfolios.But what do I actually do with my own money? Here, I\u2019ll discuss seven popular investment types on which I\u2019ve decided to take a pass. I\u2019ll also discuss the rationale behind why I\u2019ve decided not to incorporate each one.Actively Managed FundsI still own shares in a couple of actively managed funds. But they\u2019re mostly holdovers from a few rollover IRAs and make up a smallish slice of my overall assets. The majority of my fund holdings are passively managed index funds. This wasn\u2019t always the case. I spent the first part of my career analyzing mutual funds, and it\u2019s always fascinating to hear active managers explain the rationale behind their investment decisions. And there are a few active managers who have consistently added value for fund shareholders over time.But with more experience in both life and investing, I\u2019ve become more skeptical about the value of active management in general. Keeping the bulk of my assets passively managed also simplifies portfolio management. I can focus the majority of my time on making sure my overall asset mix is appropriate for my financial situation and goals instead of keeping track of whether an active manager is still adding value.At the risk of splitting hairs, I do own shares in Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B and VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF MOAT, which could both be considered quasi-actively managed portfolios. In addition to its business operations in insurance, energy generation and distribution, and rail transport, Berkshire maintains a large investment portfolio. The VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF tracks an index, but the index itself relies on human judgment. The Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index features companies that Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts believe have two key attributes: a sustainable competitive advantage and a low price compared with their estimated fair value. Real Estate Investment TrustsI have small stakes in real estate as part of my holdings in a diversified equity index fund and a target-date fund, but I don\u2019t have any dedicated exposure to REITs or other real estate stocks. I often see articles hyping up the importance of real estate in a diversified portfolio. Real estate is often touted for its generally low correlation with other equity assets, as well as its ability to generate above-average returns over time.I\u2019ve written about why I\u2019m skeptical about real estate in a previous article. There are two key reasons behind my jaundiced view: diversification and idiosyncratic risk. On the diversification side, I think the value of real estate as a portfolio diversifier has often been overstated. Over the past three years, for example, the real estate sector has had a correlation coefficient of about 0.86 when measured against the broader U.S. equity market. In addition, real estate has been subject to periodic downdrafts that are difficult to predict: Witness the 21% cumulative loss in the FTSE Nareit All Equity REIT Index from 1998 through 1999, or the 47% cumulative loss in the same index from 2007 through 2008.As these drawdowns suggest, there are a lot of idiosyncratic risks specific to real estate investing. I don\u2019t have any specialized industry knowledge that would give me a unique capability to mitigate these risks. Since I\u2019m not fully convinced about the merits of real estate in the first place, I\u2019ve put it in the \u201ctoo hard\u201d pile. Sector FundsThere\u2019s no question that innovations in healthcare, technology, and communications have the potential to enhance human progress for years to come. But there\u2019s often a disconnect between the growth potential of a given sector and its investment merit. By the time people start getting intrigued by the growth prospects for a given sector or industry, much of the potential is already priced into valuations. The technology sector, for example, which ranks as the most popular area for sector funds, is currently trading at 8% premium to estimated fair value.Over the trailing 10-year period through June 30, 2023, the average sector fund (including funds that have been merged or liquidated out of existence) has gained just 7%, compared with about 12.4% for diversified market benchmarks such as the Morningstar US Market Index. What\u2019s more, sector funds have been incredibly difficult for investors to effectively use in a portfolio. In the most recent edition of Morningstar\u2019s annual Mind the Gap study, we found that dollar-weighted returns for sector funds over the 10-year period through 2021 trailed time-weighted returns by more than 4 percentage points per year. With a track record like that, I\u2019m staying far, far away.Alternative InvestmentsAlternative investments are designed to offer something fundamentally different from mainstream asset classes. Morningstar defines these strategies based on their ability to modify, diversify, or eliminate traditional market risks. The universe of alternative funds ranges from strategies that attempt to limit or offset their equity exposure to those that focus on absolute returns, meaning they focus on capital preservation and aim to generate positive returns no matter what the market environment.As John Rekenthaler has pointed out, though, alts\u2019 track record is mixed at best. Some alternative-fund categories\u2014particularly systematic trend and equity market-neutral\u2014were successful during 2022\u2032s bear market. But over longer periods, they\u2019ve generally been disappointing. Over the past 15 years, the typical alternatives fund has gained less than 2% in annualized returns.Nontraditional equity funds, which employ strategies such as derivatives, shorting, and options overlays while maintaining exposure to traditional market risks, have fared a bit better, with annualized returns of 4.4% over the same period. But that\u2019s well behind the 8% return of a traditional 60\/40 mix of large-cap stocks and investment-grade bonds over the trailing 15-year period.Could alternative investments fare better going forward? It\u2019s possible. But I\u2019m not convinced.I BondsIn contrast to the areas discussed above, I don\u2019t have a philosophical objection to I Bonds, which are Treasury bonds that pay a fixed rate of interest plus another layer of interest that adjusts to keep up with the current inflation rate, with the inflation adjustment made every six months. I Bonds are one of the best ways to hedge against inflation, especially if you can purchase them at a time when they\u2019re offering an attractive real yield.They also boast tax benefits. I Bonds\u2019 accrued interest is exempt from federal taxes until they mature or are sold off, and all interest is free from state and local taxes.Why haven\u2019t I bought them? The reasons are pretty mundane: purchase limits and other practical drawbacks. For the most part, individual investors can only purchase $10,000 worth of I Bonds per year, making it tough to amass a big enough position to make a significant difference in an already-established portfolio. And I Bonds can only be bought and sold through the Treasury Direct website, which is reportedly somewhat clunky and out of date. At this point in my life, I\u2019m reluctant to add yet another login and password to my list, which will add complexity both during my lifetime and for surviving family members after my death.High-Yield BondsHigh-yield bonds offer a yield premium in exchange for their additional credit risk, with the yield premium over Treasuries historically averaging more than 500 basis points.They\u2019ve also generated above-average returns over time. Over the past 30 years, for example, the average high-yield bond fund has produced annualized returns of about 5.4% per year, on average, compared with 3.9% for the average intermediate-term core bond fund.But high-yield bonds also have some drawbacks. Because of their added levels of credit risk, they tend to be more equitylike than bondlike. Over the past three years, for example, the Morningstar US High-Yield Bond Index has had a correlation coefficient of about 0.85 versus a broad stock market benchmark. That makes high-yield bonds less useful as portfolio diversifiers than other fixed-income securities, such as investment-grade corporates, government bonds, and cash.High-yield bonds have also been subject to sharp drawdowns at times. During the global financial crisis, for example, high-yield bonds lost about a third of their value from June 2007 through August 2009.Overall, high-yield bonds don\u2019t look that compelling to me on a risk-adjusted basis. My main goal for fixed-income holdings is to offset the risk of my equity assets, so I\u2019ve given junk bonds a pass.GoldI\u2019ve written about some of the virtues of gold in a previous article. It has a relatively solid record as a safe haven during periods of market crisis and also sports a low correlation with most major asset classes. Over the past three years, gold had a correlation of just 0.12 when measured against stocks and just 0.43 when measured against investment-grade bonds.But I haven\u2019t been impressed enough to add it to my portfolio. Fundamentally, gold isn\u2019t a growth asset: Its value typically remains stable in inflation-adjusted terms over long-term market cycles. My primary investment goal is long-term growth, and I have enough cash and shorter-term bond holdings to add ballast during market drawdowns. If I were truly worried about some type of financial Armageddon, I\u2019d probably consider adding gold as an insurance policy, but I\u2019m still pretty sanguine about the prospects for investing in mainstream asset classes.ConclusionWould I ever consider adding a position in one of the areas discussed above? Maybe. If new evidence emerged about their merit or if I looked at the pros and cons again and came to a different conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily rule them out. At this stage, though, I\u2019m comfortable keeping them off-limits for my portfolio.Disclosure: Morningstar, Inc. licenses indexes to financial institutions as the tracking indexes for investable products, such as exchange-traded funds, sponsored by the financial institution.

{"Article Title":"What To Do With Your Cash Right Now","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/what-do-with-your-cash-right-now","Article Content":"Ruth Saldanha: Netflix\u2019s no-password-sharing has boosted the company\u2019s revenue\u2014but the stock is still expensive. How can bond managers compete with 5% yields on cash? What should\u2014and should not\u2014be in your core portfolio? This is Investing Insights.Welcome to Investing Insights. I\u2019m your host, Ruth Saldanha. Let\u2019s get started with a look at your Morningstar headlines.Netflix Surpassed ExpectationsNetflix released a solid earnings report for the second quarter, topping Morningstar estimates. The streamer\u2019s crackdown to turn password sharing into paid sharing led to the addition of almost 6 million subscribers. Netflix now boasts that it has more than 238 million global paid subscribers. Management says it expects growth to continue as the paid sharing plan is rolled out in all its markets. Despite the additional subscribers and fees, revenue lined up with estimates, partly due to stagnant average revenue per user in North America and Europe, Netflix\u2019s two largest regions. Revenue rose 3% to $8.2 billion. However, growth hasn\u2019t hit double digits since the fourth quarter of 2021, despite price hikes and the crackdown on password sharing. And once the benefits of paid sharing level off, attracting new subscribers will likely be challenging, even as competition in streaming is intensifying. Morningstar is upping its estimate for what Netflix shares are worth to $330 from $315. But still, the stock appears overvalued. United Airlines Q2 Results SoaredUnited Airlines reported robust second-quarter results, but higher costs loom on the horizon. The airline\u2019s passenger revenue surpassed Morningstar\u2019s expectations, and it almost sold out capacity, or available seats. Pilot hiring and delayed delivery of Boeing planes have constrained the U.S. airline industry. A shortage of air traffic controllers has led to capacity cutbacks. The playing field should remain level in the competitive industry as long as this continues. Morningstar expects higher revenue and booking rates across the board. Costs are starting to go up, however, as airlines try to push capacity beyond 2019 levels. Low fuel prices and unusually full planes should pay for these increases. Once either of these wavers, though, Morningstar expects lower profitability and the return of risky price competition. Morningstar is lowering its estimate for what United\u2019s shares are worth by $1, to $35 per share.PNC Projected Slower GrowthPNC Financial Services reported slightly weaker results than the biggest banks. The regional bank also projected slower growth in net interest income, or the money that banks make on loans for the full year, while larger lenders actually raised their outlooks. Rising funding costs like higher payouts to savers on their deposits and slower loan growth are driving the decline. Despite the down numbers, results came in close to Morningstar\u2019s expectations. Morningstar says regional banks will face more pressure on net interest income than the largest banks. That\u2019s in line with updated expectations, and it isn\u2019t leading to dramatic negative revisions like in the last quarter. PNC\u2019s revenue and net interest income are still set to grow this year, despite this year\u2019s banking crisis. Morningstar plans to update its forecast and may lower its $175 estimate for PNC shares. Currently, the stock looks undervalued.Inflation, Cash, and BondsNo one has escaped the effects of higher inflation\u2014whether it\u2019s when we are paying more for gas or groceries or utilities. To tame these prices, the Fed has been raising rates, and as a result, cash rates have skyrocketed\u2014in some cases to as high as 5%. How can bond managers compete? Madeline Hume is a NEXT senior research analyst for Morningstar Research Services, and she has been tracking this space and is here to talk about it. Madeline, thank you so much for being here today. Madeline Hume: Thank you for having me, Ruth.Bond Outlook 2023Saldanha: What do flows look like for bonds, especially short- and medium-term bonds?Hume: Overall, flows are pretty steady when you look at bond funds in general, but that belies a lot of volatility underneath. You\u2019ve got a large reallocation happening away from short-term bonds into bond funds that invest in longer-term bonds and also into cash. The category has lost a staggering $19 billion year to date, ranking among the highest in bond categories for outflows. Why Should Investors Consider Bonds?Saldanha: Is fleeing for bonds in favor of cash a good strategy right now? With yields being so high, why should investors consider bonds at all?Hume: Yeah, it\u2019s not a good idea now, and it\u2019s not a good idea ever. Cash and bonds both have yields, but ultimately, they serve different purposes in an investor\u2019s portfolio. Bonds have something that\u2019s known as duration, which basically means rate sensitivity. Cash doesn\u2019t have that. So effectively, you\u2019re comparing apples to oranges.Opportunity Costs of Holding Money in Bond FundsSaldanha: What about the opportunity cost of holding money in tied-up bond funds?Hume: The flip side of cash rates right now is, with cash, what you\u2019ve got is a yield that looks really promising and is quoted on an annual rate, but that rate can change at any time if interest rates are adjusting. When you think about asset allocation and diversification, it\u2019s a bit like a Ferris wheel. If something is up, that means that one asset class is performing well and another asset class is down, but that can change very quickly. So as I mentioned, with cash rates in particular, that can change nearly instantly.Bond funds, meanwhile, have money that\u2019s locked up for a little bit longer, and so you have a guaranteed rate that holds for a little bit longer period of time. There are benefits and there are drawbacks to that. The drawback is that your money is locked up, and so there may be a more promising rate elsewhere, but you have to remember that, with investing, the grass is always a little bit greener somewhere else.The reason that bond funds are not earning as much as cash right now is because yield curves are inverted, and that means that investors don\u2019t know as much about the short term as they do about the long term, so they command a little bit higher premium in order to keep their money in shorter-term investments because they\u2019re not sure if in six months or in 12 months the Fed is going to be lowering those interest rates.That\u2019s not the normal state of affairs. For investors, while they may be buying bonds now and those rates may be lower than what cash is, eventually rates will normalize and longer-term rates will come back up, and so there is this mean-reversion effect that you\u2019ve got going on. So for people who choose to put their money in cash, if rates fall, their yields immediately adjust, but bonds allow investors to reduce their reinvestment risk, and they don\u2019t have to necessarily worry about that scenario.Income in Investor\u2019s PortfolioSaldanha: What should investors do for the income portion of their portfolios right now?Hume: Cash yields are so tempting right now that it\u2019s easy to forget that we\u2019ve entered in an entirely new paradigm as far as interest rates go. Two years ago, a bond yielded about 0.21%, and today a two-year bond is yielding about 4.9%. So while you might be able to make marginally more money in cash, ultimately 4.9% is still nothing to sniff at. It\u2019s certainly much better than the scraps bond investors have been feeding on for the past 10 years. If you\u2019ve got the right asset allocation, ultimately the best advice that I have is to do nothing and let the markets do their thing.Saldanha: Great. Thank you for joining us with your perspectives, Madeline.Hume: Thank you so much, Ruth.5 Surprising Investments That Shouldn\u2019t Be Long-Term Core HoldingsSaldanha: Most of us construct our portfolios around some core holdings, and then there may be some fun or play holdings. New Morningstar research shed some light on the types of funds that should be in the core holdings for most investors\u2019 long-term portfolios\u2014and some that absolutely don\u2019t belong in that coveted core holding spot. Amy Arnott is a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, and she sat down with Morningstar Inc.\u2019s investment strategist Susan Dziubinski to discuss this. Let\u2019s listen to what they had to say.Susan Dziubinski: Hi, I\u2019m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar. New Morningstar research shed some light on the types of funds that should be the core holdings for most investors\u2019 long-term portfolios. But what types of funds don\u2019t belong among an investor\u2019s core holdings? Let\u2019s find out. I\u2019m joined today by Amy Arnott, who is a portfolio strategist with Morningstar Research Services.Hi, Amy. Nice to see you today.Amy Arnott: Thanks, Susan. Nice to be here again.Dziubinski: Now, we\u2019ve talked before about your role in portfolio research, and viewers who are interested in learning more about that can watch the video through a link that will be included in the transcript. But give us a quick rundown of what the research is about and how investors can use it.Arnott: Sure. This role in portfolio framework is really designed to give investors practical guidance when they\u2019re trying to put funds together in a portfolio. It\u2019s not just about finding good funds with low expense ratios, but then taking the next step of how do you put them together in a portfolio in a way that makes sense for your specific financial goals. When we came up with this, there are two key dimensions: One is the time horizon, and the second one, as you mentioned, is the role in portfolio\u2014or what size should a position play within the portfolio.Dziubinski: Amy, in your research, you define four roles in portfolio that an investment can offer based on the diversification that it provides. And those four roles are stand-alone, core, building block, and limited. Now stand-alone funds are those one-and-done investments that are going to provide you diversification in one place, maybe a target-date fund or asset-allocation funds. Core funds are the funds that should take up the bulk of a portfolio for an investor who doesn\u2019t want to necessarily pursue that stand-alone approach to their portfolio, that one-and-done approach. The Morningstar Categories that qualified in your research as core holdings would be from the U.S. large-blend, the foreign large-blend, and the global large-blend categories. Why these three categories?Arnott: As you mentioned, we look at core holdings as something that would be appropriate for a large percentage of your assets, which we define as somewhere as much as 40% to 80% of your assets. And we look at core holdings as something that\u2019s going to give you broad representation for a major asset class. In the case of the three categories that you mentioned, we\u2019re looking for broad exposure to stocks in general. And the three categories that you mentioned we think are appropriate as core holdings on the stock side because they are really giving you a broad representation of the overall stock market. If you look at something like Vanguard Total Stock Market, VTI, for example, you\u2019re getting exposure not just to that middle section of actual large-blend stocks but also some exposure to large-growth and large-value. So, if you\u2019re looking for something that\u2019s going to represent the equity market in general, a fund like that or a similar fund from the foreign large-blend or global large-blend category is a good place to start.Dziubinski: Got it. So, you mentioned U.S. large value and U.S. large growth, and it may surprise some readers\u2014it surprised me a little bit\u2014that these types of funds, these fund categories don\u2019t actually fall under the definition of how you\u2019re defining the core fund camp. Instead, they\u2019re sort of the next tier down. They\u2019re part of that building-block type of holding in a portfolio. Walk us through why they aren\u2019t core.Arnott: If you look at large value or large growth, these are smaller slices of the equity market, so it\u2019s not giving you quite the same level of broad market exposure. Another issue is that just as we found that it\u2019s very difficult for active managers to outperform by deviating from a market index, it\u2019s also very difficult to outperform by overweighting a specific investment style. If you do that, there might be periods when you have good returns. For example, on the large-growth side, that style outperformed by a pretty wide margin over most of the period from 2009 through 2021. But there have been other times when that would have really hurt your results. For example, during the technology correction that started in the year 2000, large-growth stocks fell behind by a pretty wide margin. And it would have taken you a long time, actually more than 13 years, to make up that loss. So, there\u2019s definitely more risk associated with overweighting either value or growth.Dziubinski: Got it. So, now, another surprise for some investors might be that U.S. small-cap blend, small-cap value, and small-cap growth, those categories aren\u2019t considered core in your framework. And in fact, they\u2019re not even considered building blocks. They were assigned the limited role, which is even further down the ladder. Why is that?Arnott: It all goes back to the idea of using the neutral market portfolio as a starting point for your equity investments. And typically, you want to keep your allocations in line with how the overall market is allocated. And so, if you look at the U.S. equity market, actually less than 10% of the outstanding market cap is in those small styles: small value, small blend, and small growth. So, that\u2019s why we assign those limited roles.Dziubinski: Got it. From a practical perspective, Amy, if investors, say, combine a U.S. large-cap growth fund with a U.S. large-cap value fund, have they really just assembled the equivalent of a U.S. large-cap blend fund? And then, in that case, if that\u2019s what an investor is doing, could that really, those two funds combined, serve as the core of a portfolio?Arnott: You certainly could do it that way. Starting out with equal weightings between large value and large growth, you would just have to make sure that you\u2019re keeping an eye on those allocations over time so that they\u2019re not getting out of balance. And you probably want to be rebalancing them once a year at least, or anytime the allocations get significantly out of balance.Dziubinski: Amy, thank you so much for your time today. This role in portfolio research is really wonderful, and we look forward to talking with you more about it.Arnott: Thanks. Great to be here.Dziubinski: I\u2019m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar.

{"Article Title":"Is International Investing Obsolete?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/is-international-investing-obsolete","Article Content":"Companies worldwide are generating more of their revenue from outside their home markets than ever before. As a result, investors may wonder why they should invest in international stocks as more U.S. companies benefit from global growth. We sat down with Morningstar Indexes strategist Dan Lefkovitz for a quick rundown of his new paper, Global Equity Markets Grow Even More Global, and what the implications are for investors.Susan Dziubinski: You recently authored some new research examining the revenue streams of nearly 8,000 companies around the globe. Your goal was to find out how much revenue companies were generating outside of their home markets. Why the undertaking?Dan Lefkovitz: In equity investing, we tend to think about geographic exposure in a one-dimensional way: Where\u2019s a company based? Looking at revenue sources adds a new dimension to our understanding. It can illuminate both risk and opportunity. Morningstar collects geographic segment data reported by thousands of companies across the world, and we can aggregate that data to the national equity market level using Morningstar country indexes. This helps answer questions like: How national are national markets? Where do they source their revenues? How have they changed over time? Dziubinski: You found that revenue streams of companies around the world are, in general, becoming more global. Delve into that.Lefkovitz: We started conducting this study in 2019\u2014prepandemic. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve seen markets become increasingly global in their revenue sources. That runs counter to the narrative that the pandemic and geopolitics are turning countries inward. For example, the Morningstar US Market Index is only 61% U.S.-based from a revenue perspective, compared with 66% in our 2019 study. Japan, most of Western Europe, Canada, and Australia all source a larger share of revenues from outside their home markets. According to our estimates, many European equity markets earn more in revenue from the U.S. than they do at home.Dziubinski: You note in your paper that the revenue globalization trend is most pronounced among developed countries and less pronounced among emerging markets. Why is that? Lefkovitz: Europe is home to many multinational companies. If you think about Nestle NSRGY of Switzerland, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy MC of France, Denmark\u2019s Novo Nordisk NVO, or Shell SHEL and BP BP of the U.K., these companies do business across the globe. In the U.S., companies like Apple AAPL, Meta META, Alphabet GOOGL, and Microsoft MSFT are global players. Some of the biggest constituents of the Morningstar Japan Index are Toyota TM and Sony SONY.On the flip side, emerging markets tend to have fewer multinationals. The Chinese equity market is dominated by local players. Banks, telecoms, and utilities are common atop emerging market indexes, and they tend to be domestically focused. There are some exceptions: Tech companies in India, South Korea, and Taiwan; and Brazil\u2019s natural resources exporters.Dig deeper: Global Equity Markets Grow Even More GlobalDziubinski: Other research has shown that the correlations between U.S. stocks and non-U.S. stocks have risen over the past two decades. Is the trend of globalizing revenue the reason why international stocks, as a group, have been less effective portfolio diversifiers for U.S.-based investors than they\u2019d been in the past?Lefkovitz: Globalizing revenue sources have likely contributed to equity markets moving in lockstep. Developed markets, which are the most globalized, are more correlated with each other than emerging markets are with developed markets. To bring this concept to life, think about biopharma companies. Whether they\u2019re based in the U.S., France, Switzerland, or Japan, they are exposed to many of the same forces. On the flip side, a bank in Indonesia and a bank in Canada don\u2019t have much in common. Dziubinski: If U.S. companies are generating more and more of their revenues from outside of the U.S., should investors even bother investing in international stocks? Put another way, are investors already getting exposure to international growth by owning U.S. companies?Lefkovitz: I like to invert this logic. If I neglect international stocks, I lack exposure to some of the leading businesses in the U.S. market. I live in the U.S., but my kids play Nintendo on a Samsung TV; I fill up my Japanese car at a British gas station; I fuel myself with a Swiss coffeemaking machine, then go running in German shoes. In investing, it makes sense to broaden the opportunity set to the fullest. There are unique companies, industries, and growth drivers that you can\u2019t get access to through a purely domestic portfolio.More Investment Portfolio Strategies Why Your Portfolio Needs International Stocks The long-term strategic rationale for building a global portfolio. 5 Surprising Investments That Shouldn't Be Long-Term Core Holdings Many would consider these types of funds to be core holdings.

{"Article Title":"Where to Invest in Bonds in 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/where-invest-bonds-2023","Article Content":"Investing in Bonds in 2023Begin to lengthen duration in second-half 2023.Monetary policy: One last rate hike will conclude this tightening cycle.Long-term interest rates projected to be at, or near, their peak and will decline going forward.Credit spreads on corporate bonds provide adequate margin of safety for downgrade and default risk.Bond Market Performance Rebounds in 2023Following the worst bond market ever in 2022, fixed-income markets have largely normalized and rebounded in 2023. This year to date, fixed-income returns are positive, with those bonds that trade with a credit spread having performed better than U.S. Treasuries.This year to date, the Morningstar Core Bond Index, our proxy for the overall bond market, has risen 2.83%. The return has been supported by a combination of underlying yield carry, declining long-term interest rates, and tightening credit spreads, partially offset by rising short-term interest rates.\n\t\t\tMorningstar U.S. Fixed Income Index Returns\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of July 19, 2023. The yield curve became further inverted in the first half of 2023. Short-term interest rates rose as the Federal Reserve hiked the federal-funds rate three times and another hike is expected at the July meeting. For example, the yield on the three-month Treasury bill rose 107 basis points to 5.49% and the yield on the one-year Treasury rose 59 basis points to 5.32%.However, on the longer end of the curve where the market dictates interest rates, as opposed to the Fed\u2019s monetary policy, yields have declined slightly. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has dropped 13 basis points to 3.75%.\n\t\t\tU.S. Treasury Interest-Rate Curve\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of July 19, 2023. Bonds that trade with an additional credit spread over equivalent maturity U.S. Treasury bonds performed the best thus far this year. For example, the Morningstar Corporate Bond Index (our proxy for investment-grade corporate bonds) rose 4.30% and the Morningstar High Yield Bond Index rose 6.81%. The reason for the outperformance was twofold. First, those bonds provide a higher yield to compensate investors for the risk of credit rating downgrades or defaults. Second, credit spreads tightened over the first half of the year. In the corporate bond market, for the year to date through July 19, the average corporate credit spread of the Morningstar Corporate Bond Index has tightened 11 basis points to +119. In the high-yield market, the average corporate credit spread of the Morningstar High Yield Bond Index has tightened 90 basis points to +389.\n\t\t\tMorningstar Corporate Bond Indexes: Average Credit Spread\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of July 19, 2023. Outlook for Investing in Bonds in Second-Half 2023Now appears to be a good time for investors to begin lengthening the duration of their fixed-income investments. According to our forecasts, we think the Federal Reserve will hike the fed-funds rate one last time at its July meeting and that will be the last hike in this monetary policy tightening cycle. Further, according to our U.S. economics team, we project that longer-term interest rates are at or near their peak and will begin to decline over the next six to 18 months.Another factor that supports extending out further on the yield curve is our expectation that the rate of economic growth will slow. While the stock market has risen from the undervalued levels we saw at the beginning of the year, stocks are now trading near our fair value. With stocks no longer undervalued and earnings under pressure from slowing economic growth, further gains in the stock market will likely be muted in the second half of this year.At this point, corporate bonds are less undervalued than we thought at the start of 2023, but based on our economic outlook (slowing growth, but no recession), we think the current credit spreads offer an adequate margin of safety to investors to offset future downgrade and default risk. Interest-Rate ProjectionsOver the second half of 2023, interest rates may vacillate as economic and inflationary metrics are released, but our forecast is that the interest rate on 10-year Treasuries will generally follow a downward trend which will continue into 2024 and 2025. Falling interest rates will push up long-term bond prices and help bolster fixed-income returns over the underlying yield carry.While short-term interest rates are currently higher than long-term interest rates due to the inverted yield curve, we think investors should begin to lengthen their duration over the next 12 months. Once the market begins to price in the Fed switching to an easing monetary policy, short-term rates will quickly begin to subside. We project the fed-funds rate will average 4.15% and 2.15% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\t\t\tMorningstar Interest Rate Forecasts\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar. Data as of June 26, 2023 End of This Monetary Policy Tightening Cycle in SightThe Federal Reserve paused and held the fed-funds rate steady at its June meeting. However, with inflation still running hotter than the Fed prefers and the economy more resilient than expected, we expect that the Fed will likely hike the federal-funds rate another 25 basis points at its July meeting. Yet, we also expect that will be the final interest-rate hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle. We expect that inflation will continue to moderate enough over the next few months to convince the Fed that it has raised interest rates enough to be appropriately restrictive to keep inflation on a downward path.Not only do we expect this will be the last hike of this monetary policy tightening cycle, but we also forecast that a combination of declining inflation and a slowing rate of economic growth will provide the Fed with the basis to begin loosening monetary policy in early 2024, with a rate cut coming as early as next February. Corporate Bond Market OutlookCorporate bonds have performed very well over the first half of the year. Performance has been driven by a combination of tightening credit spreads and the higher yield carry offered by corporates. At this point, corporate bonds are now less attractive than we noted in our 2023 bond market outlook published last December. However, we think that current spread levels are adequate to compensate investors for potential downgrade & default risk.According to PitchBook, defaults have risen back up to historical averages. Based on our economic outlook for the rate of economic growth to slow, we suspect there will likely be an additional increase in downgrades or defaults. However, considering we do not expect the economy to slip into a recession, the amount of downgrades and defaults will likely be constrained and remain below levels experienced in prior recessions.The combination of higher underlying interest rates and closer-to-average credit spreads is providing investors with some of the higher all-in yields we have seen in corporate bonds over the past 10 years. The Morningstar Corporate Bond Index currently yields 5.29% and the High Yield Index yields 8.03%. The main risk to our view is if the economy slips into a deeper and\/or more prolonged recession, in which case default rates could rise.Watch: 2023 Midyear Market Outlook","Article Anthor":"David Sekera","Article Date":1689897600000}
{"Article Title":"Why Large-Blend Funds Should Outweigh Value Plus Growth Funds in a Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/why-large-blend-is-better-than-value-plus-growth","Article Content":"Large-blend funds have much to recommend them. They\u2019re the easiest way to get broad exposure to the U.S. equity market. The category is home to some of the industry\u2019s biggest funds, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index VTSMX. And Morningstar\u2019s Role in Portfolio framework, which I rolled out earlier this year, considers large-blend funds suitable as core holdings, meaning that they could make up as much as 40% to 80% of an investor\u2019s portfolio.But there\u2019s more than one way to build a portfolio; you could obtain similar market exposure by combining a large-value fund and a large-growth fund. However, there may not be a lot to be gained by doing so.Reason #1: Better Market CoverageMorningstar defines large-blend funds as those that are fairly representative of the overall U.S. stock market in size, growth rates, and price. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large-cap. The blend style is assigned to portfolios where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate, and these portfolios usually invest in a wide range of economic sectors. The average large-blend fund offers pretty good exposure to a full spectrum of stocks, as shown below. While purists might prefer to stick with funds that only focus on truly large-cap stocks, having some exposure to small and midsize stocks isn\u2019t a bad thing, either.\n\t\t\tLarge Blend Equity-Style Exposure\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of May 31, 2023. Large-value and large-growth funds, on the other hand, are generally more concentrated toward their respective corners of the Morningstar Style Box.Reason #2: Similar Long-Term PerformanceAbout a year ago, John Rekenthaler ran some numbers to test whether buying equal stakes in Vanguard Value Index VIVAX and Vanguard Growth Index VIGRX and periodically rebalancing would yield better results than buying Vanguard 500 Index VFIAX. The two-fund portfolio had an annualized return advantage ranging from 10 basis points to 28 basis points over rebalancing frequencies ranging from monthly to five years. There was no return difference for a 10-year rebalancing schedule.One drawback of this analysis: the fund results only go back to November 1992. And the three funds aren\u2019t exact analogues, since the Value and Growth funds now track segments of the CRSP Large Cap index rather than value and growth stocks carved out from the S&P 500. I decided to take a fresh look at this question using a trio of Russell 1000 indexes, which have performance histories dating back to 1979. The Russell 1000 Value Index carves out stocks with lower price\/book ratios and lower projected growth rates, while the Growth Index consists of stocks with higher price\/book ratios and better projected growth rates for revenue and earnings. The Russell 1000 Index combines the holdings of both indexes.The results were underwhelming, to say the least. As shown in the table below, there was virtually no difference in performance for a two-index test portfolio relative to the large-blend benchmark over most rebalancing frequencies. Of all the tempos tested, the seven-year rebalancing schedule looks most promising. While an annualized performance edge of 18 basis points might elicit a response of \u201cmeh,\u201d it could be worth the effort if you have a very long time horizon and are disciplined enough to stick to the schedule (and remember to rebalance). Over the past 44 1\/2 years, an initial investment of $10,000 split between value and growth and consistently rebalanced every seven years would have ended up with a portfolio value of about $1.6 million, or about $110,000 greater than $10,000 invested in the Russell 1000 Index.\n\t\t\tTesting the Value Plus Growth Portfolio\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct and author's calculations. Data as of June 30, 2023. I also tested a threshold rebalancing strategy, which involved rebalancing the two-index portfolio whenever one of the components drifted more than 5 or 10 percentage points away from its initial weighting. Here too, there\u2019s not much to write home about. The 5% rebalancing strategy for the two-index portfolio came out ever so slightly ahead of the blend index over the full period, but the difference in returns was small. The 10% rebalancing strategy, on the other hand, led to slightly lower returns.\n\t\t\tTesting the Value Plus Growth Portfolio: 5% and 10% Rebalancing Bands\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct and author's calculations. Data as of June 30, 2023. And while value and growth have taken over market leadership over various periods (such as growth stocks over the period 2009-21 and value stocks in 2022), the results for the two styles weren\u2019t dramatically different over the full period from 1979 through mid-2023. Despite academic research supporting a long-term performance advantage for value stocks, growth issues came out slightly ahead over the past 44-odd years in my study. But the difference was less than 30 basis points per year. While growth edged out value, both style indexes fell slightly behind the Russell 1000 over the full period.\n\t\t\tGrowth of $10,000\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Reason #3: Minimal Diversification BenefitsWe took a deep dive into correlation coefficients for various asset classes in our 2023 Diversification Landscape report. As shown in the table below, most investment styles have fairly high correlations with the overall market. Morningstar\u2019s Large Growth and Large Value indexes had correlations of 0.92 and 0.89, respectively, with the Morningstar U.S. Market Index. There might be some risk reduction benefit from diversifying into value and growth, but it\u2019s pretty small. What\u2019s more, combining value and growth into one portfolio would wipe out any potential diversification benefits.\n\t\t\tThree-Year Correlation Matrix by Investment Style\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. When Large Value Funds and Large Growth Funds Are Worth OwningHowever, style-specific funds can still play a useful role. If you own a stock or fund that you\u2019re reluctant to sell, you might end up with a portfolio tilted toward either value or growth. For example, someone owning a large stake in Apple AAPL (such as yours truly), might end up with a portfolio tilted toward the Large Growth corner of the Morningstar Style Box. Investing in a value-oriented fund could help offset the portfolio\u2019s growth bias.An investor could also deploy a style-specific fund to take advantage of valuation discrepancies if growth stocks seem more attractively priced than value, or vice versa. As of May 31, large-value stocks covered by Morningstar\u2019s equity analysts had an aggregate price\/fair value ratio of 0.82, compared with 0.97 for large-growth issues. If our analysts\u2019 fair value estimates are accurate, large-value stocks should generate higher returns as market prices converge to fair value. But as the rebalancing tests above suggest, reversion to the mean doesn\u2019t always happen on a predictable schedule. ConclusionStyle-based investing has gained favor since Eugene Fama and Kenneth French\u2019s landmark research in 1992. The three-factor model they came up with (and Morningstar popularized with the Morningstar Style Box) goes a long way toward explaining investment performance and risk. But while it seems plausible that combining growth and value could lead to better results over time, that does not seem to be the case.","Article Anthor":"Amy Arnott","Article Date":1689552000000}
{"Article Title":"Is It Time to Break Up With the Bonds in Your Portfolio?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/with-cash-rates-nearing-5-is-it-time-break-up-with-bonds-your-portfolio","Article Content":"Investors concerned about inflation have many lingering effects to worry about, including higher prices at the gas pump, in the grocery store, and on utility bills. But there is one bright spot: Because of persistently high inflation, cash rates have skyrocketed, with rates on some high-yield savings accounts, money market funds, and other cash instruments reaching yields as lofty as 5%.Bond investors might feel left out, especially if their investments are maturing soon. As of July 2023, 2-Year Treasury bonds issued in July 2021 pay out a paltry 0.2%, and funds in the short-term bond Morningstar Category lost an average of 5.2% last year. These facts might explain why short-term bond funds have the largest net outflows of any bond category this year to date, hemorrhaging $19.4 billion through the end of June. There\u2019s reason to wonder if it might not be better to seek the sure thing and move into cash; with flows that massive, there\u2019s reason to believe many investors already have.\n\t\t\tBottom 5 Bond Categories By Flows YTD\n\t\t      Why Should I Keep Bonds in My Portfolio?With cash rates this high, are short-term bond allocations redundant? The short answer is no.Cash rates are easy come, easy go. (Although investors with money parked in traditional savings accounts, which still yield less than 1% in many cases, might beg to differ.) Savings rates may be denominated in annual percentage yield terms, but they are rarely locked in for any sort of fixed term. Banks can dial the rate up or down, essentially at will. That means cash lacks duration, one of the more useful tools in an investor\u2019s quiver. Duration solves a different portfolio problem than cash, which means that bonds and cash shouldn\u2019t be compared like-for-like.Cash might be a handy parking spot for emergency savings, but for expenses any further than two years out, bonds are the better match. That\u2019s because bonds are typically offered with a yield that\u2019s fixed over the life of the bond.For example, if you buy a bond with a duration that aligns with the time your payment is due, you can lock in a yield over that time horizon that fits with your liability. In the meantime, you won\u2019t have to worry about reinvesting your savings to chase a better rate if interest rates fall\u2014unlike investors who are keeping their money in cash. Put another way, for investors that can hang on to their bond investment to maturity, what happens to interest rates after they buy their bond isn\u2019t terribly important. If an investor holds a bond until it expires, at the end of that period, (assuming the issuer is creditworthy) they are made whole. When a bond matures, its owner gets their principal back, and they can use the proceeds to address their saving goals.Sounds Great, Except \u2026In the meantime, your money is effectively tied up. It\u2019s possible that bonds underperform other asset classes (like cash) while you hold on to them, and there\u2019s not much you can do about it. It\u2019s even possible to lose money if rates rise and you sell a bond before it matures.But, again, investors generally won\u2019t experience any observable losses in bonds held to maturity. On the other hand, investors in a short-term bond fund have a very different row to hoe, with both yields and returns fluctuating on nearly a daily basis. How is it possible that bond funds lose money when an individual holding a bond can always opt to stick it out and recoup their principal? There are a few reasons for that. First, funds have to manage cash flows in a way that an individual owning a bond doesn\u2019t. An investor owning a single bond only has to worry about the coupons they receive and the principal that the issuer repays at the end. But every single day people buy into and sell out of mutual funds; they\u2019re a pooled investment, after all. Plus, managers can only distribute cash at certain pre-specified times, which means they must reinvest the coupons they receive in the interim. Bond managers trade bonds all the time, even if all their existing investors sit tight.Beyond the constraints of the mutual fund vehicle, bond funds behave differently from individual bonds in another key respect. An individual bond\u2019s duration will decline as it approaches maturity.\n\t\t\tDuration of a Hypothetical 5-Year, 5% Semiannual Bond\n\t\t      Bond fund managers typically maintain a constant maturity, which means that unlike an individual bond, the fund never expires. A fund that invests in short-term bonds will continuously roll forward its bonds so that its maturity will always be roughly several years out from today. As one bond nears maturity, the fund will buy another to nudge the portfolio\u2019s maturity forward and keep its duration stable.\n\t\t\tDuration of Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF, 2019-2023\n\t\t      This mechanism causes the returns of an investment with a constant maturity, like a bond fund, to vary depending on the path that interest rates take.Then Why Do Investors Stick With Short-Term Bond Funds?Partly it\u2019s a matter of convenience. Bond investing obeys the economies of scale, which makes it a good candidate for outsourcing. There\u2019s an old rule of thumb in bond investing that you need at least $100,000 to adequately diversify a bond portfolio\u2014hardly chump change. Plus, money managers get better rates on transactions than retail investors do.Additionally, it may be easy to guess roughly when an event that you\u2019ve been saving up for is going to occur, but in many cases it\u2019s much harder to pin down the precise timing of the cash outlay. In these types of situations, individual bonds may be too fine an instrument. If you have a goal that you\u2019re saving for with an uncertain start and end date, a basket of bonds with constant maturity gives you critical leeway in your portfolio.Finally, even if you don\u2019t have a timed goal in mind, your portfolio may still stand to benefit from carrying some duration. Very short-term instruments like cash are currently paying more than longer-term investments because yield curves are inverted.\n\t\t\tUS Treasury Yield Curve\n\t\t      That\u2019s not the normal state of affairs. Longer-term rates are typically higher than shorter-term rates, and eventually the current pattern will reverse. That means that over longer periods a yield boost does kick in for holding bonds instead of cash.How much duration you should hold depends on a whole host of other factors, like your age and the time until the goal you\u2019re saving for. No matter what your priorities are, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that bonds tend to outperform stocks during bear markets. That makes them a good ballast to have on hand, no matter what else is happening in the markets.","Article Anthor":"Madeline Hume","Article Date":1689552000000}
{"Article Title":"What I\u2019ve Done Right With My Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/what-i-got-right","Article Content":"If you read my column last week, you might have concluded that my investment portfolio is a mess. By my own admission, I hold too much company stock and too much cash, and I don\u2019t have anything close to the recommended allowance of bonds for a person my age. And while I often write about tax matters and understand the tax code pretty well, my record on curbing taxes hasn\u2019t been perfect. I\u2019ve held tax-inefficient funds in a taxable account and have been slow to move money into IRAs each year. Inertia (laziness, sloth, whatever you want to call it) has been the major factor behind almost all of these problem spots.But you know what? Despite these missteps, my husband and I have managed to do just fine from a big-picture standpoint; our financial plan is well in hand. Here\u2019s what has worked for us, as well as my most unscientific assessment of whether the successes resulted more from luck or skill.We Maintained a High Savings RateJust as an all-black wardrobe can conceal unwanted holiday pounds, so can a high savings rate cover up a multitude of investment sins. So when I think about what has worked for us from an investment standpoint, over the long haul, a high savings rate has to be at the top of the pyramid. Luck played a starring role in our ability to save: My husband and I had the good fortune of emerging from college debt-free, which enabled us to buy a house and start saving for retirement early in our careers. We\u2019ve also both been employed for three-plus decades, meaning that we\u2019ve been able to steadily sock away a good share of our incomes and benefit from employer-matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and a long runway of investment compounding. I have previously mentioned that we don\u2019t have a budget, but automating our investment contributions\u2014not just into our company retirement plans but into our taxable account as well\u2014has helped us be disciplined about saving in good markets and bad. That\u2019s not to say we haven\u2019t made sacrifices, especially earlier in our careers. We spent many a weekend working on our old house when we were just starting out, and I\u2019ve always taken my husband\u2019s hand-me-down cars and driven them for a long time. The home renovations were fun\u2014mostly!\u2014and I\u2019m not into cars so it\u2019s a stretch to call either of those things a big sacrifice. Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 30% luck\/70% skillStocks DeliveredWe\u2019ve also lucked out in terms of market performance during our years of investing. There have been some bad spots: 2000-02 and 2007-09, to name the biggies. But over our 35-year horizon thus far, stocks have returned about 11% on an annualized basis. That\u2019s a fabulous rate of return by any measure and one that we fully benefited from thanks to an equity-heavy posture throughout the period. Of course, stock market returns over any specific time horizon are mainly luck of the draw, but I\u2019m giving us a few skill points here, too. While I haven\u2019t calculated an internal rate of return for our investments over our entire time horizon, I know that we haven\u2019t pulled back from stocks during times of market duress. We\u2019ve kept on investing and even added extra to them, above and beyond our automatic contributions, when we\u2019ve had extra cash on hand during such periods. It has helped that we\u2019re too busy to think much about our investments, and intellectually we understand that stocks invariably shake off their periodic swoons.Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 80% luck\/20% skill We Curbed Investment CostsLimiting investment costs has been another important tailwind, one that enabled us to \u201creceive our fair share of the market\u2019s returns.\u201d (I can never write those words without hearing Jack Bogle\u2019s booming baritone in my ears.) I quickly got religion on the importance of limiting costs shortly after starting at Morningstar in 1993. The first investing book I read in my new job was Burton Malkiel\u2019s \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street,\u201d which makes a compelling case for low-cost passive investing. And as an analyst, I learned that expense ratios were much more predictive of a fund\u2019s future prospects than its past returns. Morningstar\u2019s 401(k) investment menu skews toward low-cost investments, too, and my husband and I gravitated to cheap funds for the rest of our portfolio. It\u2019s hard to know where luck ends and skill begins with this one, so I\u2019m calling it a draw.Luck vs. Skill Ratio: 50% luck\/50% skillWe Kept It \u201cBasic\u201dJust last week I learned that my taste in all sorts of things (Lululemon, avocado toast) is what the kids might call \u201cbasic.\u201d And my preferences in the realm of investing products are most definitely basic, too. I\u2019ll admit that we got off to an inauspicious start on this front: Our very first non-401(k) investment was the niche-y and high-cost Templeton Developing Markets TEDMX, the result of me attending an early Morningstar Investment Conference and enthusiastically trusting the long-term prospects for emerging markets. We also dabbled in individual stocks early on, in that period in the late 1990s when everyone seemed to be opening a brokerage account. But our portfolio was largely anchored in core stock funds from the start. I had become an avid reader of Bogle, Jason Zweig, Bill Bernstein, and Jonathan Clements, all of whom enthused about the virtues of a minimalist, low-cost investing approach. My own cynicism about the investment industry grew, too, as I observed the all-too-familiar pattern of firms launching products only after an asset class had enjoyed a strong runup in the market. While we have steadfastly maintained a healthy allocation to non-U.S. stocks, which has certainly held back our results relative to a U.S. 60\/40 allocation, that\u2019s about as exotic as it gets for us. Just as important is what we\u2019ve avoided: We haven\u2019t bitten on alternative investment products, cryptocurrency, thematic funds, or any number of other investment fads that have come and gone over the years. I haven\u2019t run the numbers, but I know ignoring the fads has redounded to the benefit of our long-term results.

{"Article Title":"Taking the Slow Road to Investment Success","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/bill-bernsteins-four-pillars-investing-second-edition","Article Content":"Part of the StoryIn 2021, I wrote a column called \u201cWhy the Rich Have Become Richer.\u201d It was correct as far as it went\u2014and it went reasonably far. While most analyses of the nation\u2019s growth in wealth disparity analyze how wages have risen faster for high-income employees than for everyday workers (thus, the ongoing complaints about CEO pay), I included the effect of a second item: The Great Bull Market.Given that equity returns have overwhelmingly outstripped wage increases over the past half-century, and that wealthy Americans are much likelier to own stocks than their compatriots, the rise in stock prices has overwhelmingly helped the affluent.A valid argument. (If I say so myself.) Since the 1970s, the top wage earners have not only outstripped others\u2019 incomes, but they have also benefited most from the stock market\u2019s boom. Throw in the profits from real estate investing, which have also mostly accrued to the wealthy, and that\u2019s quite the trifecta! The Missing Piece: Investment PsychologyBut of course, more can be said about the subject, which Bill Bernstein amply does in the newly released second edition of his 2002 classic, The Four Pillars of Investing. The book covers a wide range of territory: investment theory and history, financial advisory practices, and portfolio construction. But Its section on investor psychology best addresses what my argument omitted.(Note: I provided a back-cover blurb, but alas will not be receiving any of the book\u2019s revenue.)When Bernstein wrote the first edition of Four Pillars, as a relative newcomer to the field, he was enthralled by the numbers. Investment research is bounded by science. In contrast with many of his quantitatively minded peers, though, he recognized from the start that investment math could also be a trap. History never repeats exactly\u2014sometimes not even approximately. For that reason, he addressed investor psychology. Twenty years later, he has expanded on that message. The second edition opens by contrasting two investors: 1) the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, run by two Nobel Laureates, and 2) Sylvia Bloom, a legal secretary. The former belied its name by surviving only four years, while the latter persisted for 67 years, with great success. Writes Bernstein, \u201cUnlike the geniuses at LTCM, [Bloom] wasn\u2019t trying to get rich quick, but rather to get rich slow\u2014a much safer bet.\u201dThat sentence neatly summarizes Bernstein\u2019s counsel. Speculators pursue high returns; investors seek appropriate returns. Four Pillars spends little time on the obvious forms of speculation, such as buying meme stocks or trading options. No need to beat that horse; the book\u2019s readers either already realize the futility of tail-chasing, or they bought the book because they are ready to absorb that lesson.Four Pillars instead addresses the type of errors that educated investors might unknowingly make\u2014and that Bloom did not. They include 1) becoming seduced by investment narratives, as made by intriguing but ultimately mediocre theme funds; 2) succumbing to recency bias; and 3) believing too strongly in one\u2019s own abilities, thereby discounting the wisdom of the crowd. (Is the marketplace crazy? Perhaps. But that occurs far less often than most investors believe.) The Biggest MistakeThe most dangerous delusion, states Bernstein, comes not from how investors perceive the outside world, but instead from how they view themselves. The first edition of Four Pillars included a risk-tolerance table, to help readers establish their equity allocation. For example, investing 80% of one\u2019s assets in stocks might lead to a 35% portfolio decline, under unusually bad (although not the worst possible) circumstances, while owning 40% would cut the loss to 15%.Writes Bernstein in the second edition:I neglected to ask whether readers had actually lost 15%, 25%, or 35% of their portfolio. Simply looking at this table or running a portfolio simulation on a spreadsheet is not the same as facing real-world losses. The stock market only rarely falls for no good reason \u2013 bear markets are almost always the result of incipient financial system collapse, hyperinflation, or the prospect of nuclear annihilation. The fear of real geopolitical and economic catastrophe makes such times the most dangerous mountain passes on the highway of riches. That is, it is not enough to have been in the right place at the right time, as wealthy Americans have been during the past 40 years. Investors must also know how to convert their paper opportunities into tangible dollars, by making sound decisions that withstand the test of time. Underinvesting is an obvious problem, as one can\u2019t pocket stock market gains without stocks. But overinvesting can also be a costly error. Getting rich slowly means finding the appropriate personal level.That conclusion may seem simple, but enacting it proves surprisingly difficult. Over the years, tens of millions of investors have crashed upon the asset-allocation rock. Such a fate, however, is unlikely to befall those who read Four Pillars. By the time the reader encounters Bernstein\u2019s homily on risk perception, the book already established 200 pages of context, with another 100 yet to follow. The advice is therefore not hollow. It echoes.ConclusionMy previous two columns, on whether older investors have become too aggressive and the inadequacy of alternative investments, can broadly speaking be regarded as defending relatively high equity exposures. I am happy to defend those claims. If taken in context, they are (I believe) both accurate and helpful.But no investment argument tells the full story. Although also supporting the concept of holding stocks for the long term, Four Pillars does so from a different perspective. It not only complements my thinking but also sometimes challenges it. I learned a lot from reading the book.

{"Article Title":"Should Emerging Markets Play a Role in Your Portfolio?","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/should-emerging-markets-play-role-your-portfolio","Article Content":"Emerging-markets investors haven\u2019t been feeling much love lately. As international stocks in general have fallen behind the U.S. market for more than a decade, emerging markets, which are generally defined as countries that have lower levels of income per capita and are making the transition to become more developed, have been even weaker.Over the trailing 15-year period through June 30, 2023, the Morningstar Emerging Markets Index has generated annualized returns of just 3.1% per year, compared with 4.1% for the Morningstar DM xUS Index. The picture looks even worse over the past 12 months. As developed-markets stocks have rallied to a 17.1% gain, emerging-markets stocks have gained just 4%. As a result, diversified emerging-markets funds (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) have suffered about $8.9 billion in net outflows for the trailing 12-month period through May 2023.These disappointing results notwithstanding, there are still valid arguments for investing in emerging-markets stocks. In this article, I\u2019ll look at risk-adjusted returns over longer periods, as well as other reasons investors may not want to give up on emerging markets just yet. The Rise and Fall of Emerging MarketsBy definition, emerging markets should have greater growth potential than more established equity markets. As mentioned above, emerging markets generally produce less economic output relative to the size of their populations. As these countries become more industrialized and integrated with the global economy, rapid economic growth can follow, often accompanied by robust equity-market returns.That is exactly what happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dates back to the end of 1987, just as global economies were opening up and investment capital was flowing into markets that were formerly unavailable. As a result, rolling three-year returns for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index trounced more-developed markets by healthy margins through over most periods up until early 1995.\n\t\t\tRolling Three-Year Difference in Returns\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. The trend reversed in the mid-1990s following the Mexican peso crisis in December 1994 and the Asian currency crisis in 1997. Emerging markets fell behind their developed counterparts from 1994 through 1998, and lagged again in the tech correction in 2000. Driven by robust economic growth in China and rising global commodity prices, emerging markets then entered a secular bull market that lasted until the global financial crisis in 2008.After staging a strong (albeit partial) recovery in 2009 and 2010, emerging markets ran hot and cold in the following years. Both 2013 and 2021 stand out as examples of what can go wrong. Emerging-markets stocks fell about 17 percentage points behind developed-market issues in 2013, when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it planned to slow down its bond-buying program and tighten monetary policy. They fell out of favor again in 2021 because of market worries over slower economic growth and regulatory uncertainty in China, which makes up about 30% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. These dramatic swings in performance were accompanied by above-average risk levels. As shown in the table below, standard deviation for the emerging-markets benchmark has been about 30% higher than that of developed markets since 1988, and emerging markets have also been subject to more extreme drawdown risk. Recovery times have been prolonged, as well. After the painful drawdown during the global financial crisis, for example, emerging markets didn\u2019t fully recover until nearly 10 years later.\n\t\t\tReturn, Risk, and Drawdown Stats (Jan. 1, 1998, through June 30, 2023)\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. However, emerging markets\u2019 volatility has been partly offset by their relatively low correlations with U.S. markets. The correlation coefficient between emerging markets and the U.S. equity market has averaged about 0.66 since performance data started in 1988. As a result, adding emerging markets to a globally diversified portfolio (including both U.S. and non-U.S. stocks) has led to better risk-adjusted returns more often than not. To test this, I created two separate portfolios: One with a 30% stake in developed-market stocks and the remainder in U.S. equities, and the other with a 20% stake in developed-market stocks, 10% in emerging markets, and the remainder in U.S. equities. The emerging-markets version came out with better risk-adjusted returns in about 68% of all trailing three-year periods since 1988.\n\t\t\tRolling Three-Year Difference in Risk-Adjusted Returns\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Assessing the Odds Going ForwardWill emerging markets continue to add value going forward? There are a few key considerations. The dollar\u2019s strength versus other major currencies is one of the most important ones. Emerging markets typically fall behind when the dollar strengthens, which is one of the main reasons they\u2019ve lagged over the past 15 years or so. A strong U.S. dollar often hurts emerging-markets economies because it raises the cost of imports (including food and energy) and leads to less foreign investment.\n\t\t\tEmerging-Markets Performance vs. U.S. Dollar\n\t\t      Source: Morningstar Direct. Data as of June 30, 2023. Valuation is another key consideration. Valuations for emerging-markets stocks have declined, leading some investors to argue that they\u2019re currently undervalued. In terms of relative valuation, though, emerging markets haven\u2019t declined all that much. Emerging-markets stocks typically trade at a discount to stocks from developed markets, partly reflecting their higher levels of political and economic risk. Emerging markets also have fewer safeguards for investor protection and can be subject to bribery and corruption. Over time, price multiples such as price\/book, price\/sales, and price\/earnings are typically about 40% lower for emerging markets relative to the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\t\t\tEmerging-Markets Valuations vs. U.S. Market\n\t\t      Viewed from this perspective, valuations for emerging markets don\u2019t look all that compelling. The Morningstar Emerging Markets Index currently trades at about 11.4 times earnings for the trailing 12-month period, compared with a longer-term average of 13.5. Relative to the U.S. market, though, the P\/E multiple is now 0.56, which is only slightly lower than the longer-term average of 0.59.Another argument frequently made in favor of emerging markets is their greater growth potential. Based on data from the International Monetary Fund, emerging markets made up about 58.3% of global gross domestic product and 86.1% of the global population in 2022. As markets continue to develop and modernize, emerging markets\u2019 share of the global economy should expand. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that the rapid economic growth many investors now expect will materialize, or that if it does, economic growth will translate into stock market gains for emerging markets.ConclusionEmerging markets\u2019 growth potential and generally low correlations with more developed markets make them worth including in a diversified portfolio. A prolonged period of weakness in the U.S. dollar could also provide a tailwind. However, their higher levels of risk make deviating from the global market-cap weighting (currently about 8%) a risky bet.","Article Anthor":"Amy Arnott","Article Date":1688947200000}
{"Article Title":"Pumpkin Spice Lattes Could Be a Great Addition to a Plain-Vanilla Portfolio","Article Link":"https:\/\/www.morningstar.com\/portfolios\/pumpkin-spice-lattes-could-be-great-addition-plain-vanilla-portfolio","Article Content":"Working in finance, I\u2019ve come across plenty of silly investment ideas and kitschy indexes in my day. (See VanEck Agribusiness ETF MOO or the KPOP and Korean Entertainment ETF KPOP).None have hit so close to home as the one I recently stumbled across on Reddit: $BECKY, also known as the White Girl Index, a hypothetical basket of equally weighted stocks. (It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s not an exchange-traded fund\u2014yet.)Each company on this list sells a major product or service that\u2019s favored by people supposedly like me\u2014white American women, who are sometimes characterized as \u201cbasic.\u201d \u201cBasic\u201d people like popular, mainstream things, such as Starbucks\u2019 SBUX pumpkin spice lattes, avocado toast for brunch, and leggings from Lululemon LULU. What Companies Are Listed on the Index?\n\t\t\t'White Girl Index' Original Constituents\n\t\t      Some might find the idea of the list offensive. I certainly bristled a little bit when I first saw it.For starters, Becky is my mother\u2019s name. And while I do love the occasional Target TGT run, many of the other companies on this list don\u2019t resonate with me. I drink my coffee black, not pumpkin-spiced, and I\u2019ve never owned North Face clothing.Everyone\u2019s tastes are unique, and it can be uncomfortable when people draw on those tastes to make generalizations about your race and gender. Importantly, these products have gained widespread popularity because they resonate with people of many different backgrounds. Still, I recognized that the point was to find a list of companies that had broad appeal among a specific demographic. So, I chalked it up to a lighthearted caricature and chose to focus on the meat and potatoes: the list itself.Why The Index Continues to Resonate With Some Investors, Despite Its FlawsThe list may not be a suitable investment strategy for everyone. First, it\u2019s a concentrated list, which means that outliers pack a big punch. Diversification is essential for long-term success in investing, and when it comes to putting together a portfolio, concentration is just the opposite.That said, I was struck by just how old this list was by social media\u2019s standards. The original list dates back to 2018, and some companies on it don\u2019t even trade publicly anymore. It has experienced enough staying power that the subreddit has periodically checked in to see how it\u2019s performed since the idea was first conceived. Standouts include Deckers DECK, Apple AAPL, and Lululemon LULU.\n\t\t\tTop 5 Performers\n\t\t      Laggards include Under Armour UAA and Canada Goose GOOS.\n\t\t\tBottom 5 Performers\n\t\t      I was impressed by the dedication to this index. While it is not my personal cup of tea, people seemed to care about it enough to revisit it years later and give it tune-ups. Given that trends on social media tend to travel at warp speed, that endurance is no small feat. And in my experience, as far as explicit references to women in investing communities go, the pickings are slim. There is something notable about the subreddit\u2019s commitment to this particular index, however silly it might seem. Sure, it\u2019s a cobbled-together list that applies to a specific subset of women, but at least someone out there is trying.I\u2019d argue that it speaks to a deeper truth about investing, too. We all know by now that we\u2019re supposed to go out into the market and shop around for quality businesses with competitive advantages at a discount. Sounds simple, right?Unfortunately, for women it rarely is. It is well-known that women have lower confidence in their investing abilities than men and are more likely to feel discouraged from making investment decisions. This is aggravated by an appetite in the financial-services industry to make investments as complicated and esoteric as possible.What if Getting Started With Investing Was as Simple as Buying a Pair of Well-Made Leggings?So often investment professionals bandy about terms like a business\u2019 consumers or its customer base when making the case for its potential growth. These terms sound professional to the casual listener but obscure reality. When we talk about the audiences that businesses sell their products to, ultimately, we\u2019re just talking about regular people, with a limited amount of resources, deciding how best to distribute their money on the things that bring them joy. Like a fizzy seltzer water or a warm pair of boots. Those purchases might seem frivolous to some, but in aggregate, it\u2019s serious business.Every single one of us has a list of companies whose products we like and whose business models make sense to us; I can think of far worse starting points for an investing journey. Even if fur-lined slippers aren\u2019t your comfy clothing item of choice, that\u2019s OK. My list of businesses may look different from yours or $BECKY or my mom Becky\u2019s.It\u2019s also possible that your list might look very similar to mine, or to your friends\u2019 and neighbors\u2019. That\u2019s fine, too. It\u2019s preferable to getting caught up chasing the flavor of the month and winding up as the proverbial hare. You want to look for businesses that are pumpkin-spiced, not candy-coated. Trends fade; well-made products endure.I\u2019ll admit, the index doesn\u2019t have a perfect record on this front. Some companies, like Snap SNAP, lost their relevance long ago. Others, like L Brands, are already defunct. It\u2019s important to look for companies that actively cultivate competitive advantages, like a food and beverage company with savvy brand development or a record label with prudent capital allocation.Trust your instincts, and don\u2019t overthink it. If you don\u2019t get what\u2019s going on with a stock, it\u2019s going to be a lot harder to stick with your investment through the inevitable rough patches. If the whole thing seems too daunting, remember that index funds are called plain vanilla for a reason: They satisfy most people. When it comes to simplifying the dizzying array of choices we\u2019re assailed with each and every day, that can be enough.With investing, no matter who you are or what your goals are, sometimes it pays to keep it basic.The views expressed here are the author\u2019s.","Article Anthor":"Madeline Hume","Article Date":1688601600000}
