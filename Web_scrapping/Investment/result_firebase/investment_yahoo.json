That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money.Credit cards can be useful in building a higher credit score and financing some of life\u2019s more expensive purchases. Hundreds of credit cards are available, which raises the question: How many should you carry?For some credit-averse consumers, leaning on credit cards is a risky game that can lead to a debt spiral. For others, it\u2019s an essential wealth-building tool that can expand their purchasing power and help them save.How many credit cards does the average American have?The average American has three credit cards, with an average balance of $5,525, down from $5,897 in 2020 and $6,494 in 2019. While less popular than traditional credit cards, retail credit cards still have a place in most consumers\u2019 wallets. Most adults carry an average of 2.3 store cards.According to 2022 data from the Federal Reserve, 82% of American adults have a credit card. While this is the majority, it signals that a significant portion of Americans still do not carry a credit card.It also suggests that consumers can easily build credit with other types of loans like a mortgage, personal loan, car loan, and others. However, the numbers show clearly that credit cards are widely used and offer an accessible path to build a positive credit history.For consumers who want to use a credit card as their primary tool for building credit, they might start with a student card or no-frills secured credit card. These types of cards are typically easier to qualify for and won\u2019t charge an annual fee. Once you\u2019ve used a credit card and made on-time monthly payments, you might consider adding a new card to the mix.When it makes sense to get a new credit cardCredit cards are not all built the same, and there is no set number or specific type of card you should carry. Getting a new type of credit card could make it easier to pay down debt, finance significant purchases, build credit, start a business, and more.Some consumers may choose to go without a credit card and work on building their credit by taking on other types of debt.For others, the right mix of cards can help them save money and make it easier to reach their financial goals. Some of the most common card types include:Rewards cardsRewards cards can be useful for the cardholder who wants to save on travel, dining, and entertainment through cash back, points, or miles. If you\u2019re a frequent traveler, issuers such as Chase, Capital One, Citi, and American Express all offer travel credit cards with lucrative rewards programs that can help you save on airfare, baggage fees, hotel stays, and travel insurance, among other services.Balance transfer cardsBalance transfer credit cards are another type of credit card that may be worthwhile if your priority is to pay off credit card debt. These cards make it easier for consumers to pay off debt faster without being bogged down by high interest charges.Cash-back cardsCash-back cards can help you save on some of your day-to-day expenses by giving you back a percentage of what you spend on different purchases. Once you\u2019ve earned enough cash back, you can redeem it for a statement credit, check, direct deposit, gift cards, and more.Secured credit cardsFor consumers who have a thin credit profile, secured credit cards \u2013 which require a cash deposit to open \u2013 can offer a chance to showcase their credit habits and build their credit score.How to settle on the right number of credit cards for youLanding on the \"right\" number of credit cards for your financial situation will depend on your budget, your future plans, and your comfort handling multiple accounts, each with payments due every month. How much you pay for your rent or mortgage, utilities and other household expenses, savings goals, and other debt obligations will help you determine how much credit you can manage.If you're considering a new credit card, think carefully about your habits and upcoming purchases.If you\u2019re a frequent shopper at a particular store\u2026Apply for a credit card that will reward you for the purchases you already planned to make. Say you cook most of your meals at home and make weekly trips to the grocery store, a credit card like the Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card that rewards your spending at the grocery store and doesn\u2019t charge an annual fee can help you lower your food bill each week.If you regularly fill up your tank at the same gas station, or are planning a road trip, adding a fuel rewards card like the Citi Premier\u00ae Card to your wallet can help you earn rewards points each time you fill up.If you have a major purchase on the horizon\u2026The right credit card can help you make that bigger purchase more manageable. Say you\u2019re upgrading your home with new appliances, a credit card like the Discover it\u00ae Cash Back with a generous introductory offer could help you finance that type of purchase and pay it off over a longer period while lowering how much you pay in interest.If your credit card balances are creeping up on you\u2026Adding the right type of card to the mix can be a key part of your repayment strategy. If you want to pay down some or all of an existing credit card debt, a balance transfer card with more favorable terms could cut down your repayment timeline. It may seem counterintuitive to add a new credit card to your plate if you\u2019re struggling to make payments. Still, if interest charges are making it difficult to reduce your principal balance, a balance transfer card could work in your favor.The Citi Simplicity\u00ae Card, for example, boasts a 21-month interest-free balance transfer period, then 19.24%-29.99% variable APR.Do you prefer simplicity vs. playing the rewards game?Some consumers thrive off the savings and perks their credit card rewards provide. However, this often comes at the cost of paying annual fees and being mindful of multiple monthly statements and various fee structures.Travel credit cards, for example, boast lucrative rewards, but they can also come with above-average annual fees. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, for example, charges an annual fee of $395, which may be more than some cardholders are willing to pay. But one major perk that can make this card more appealing is the annual $300 travel credit that Venture X cardholders will get back as a statement credit each year for bookings through Capital One Travel.If you are the type of cardholder who can keep tabs on multiple credit cards each statement cycle, you might benefit from having more than one credit card. Still, applying for a new credit card is a big decision, and with greater access to credit comes greater responsibility. If you don\u2019t have a good handle on your budget, having more credit cards could become difficult to manage.How to start building your credit score with a credit cardHaving a credit card gives you opportunities a debit card doesn\u2019t. You can build credit using other forms of debt, but credit cards can provide a more immediate route to hitting your long-term financial goals while, with some cards, trimming your day-to-day expenses.One of the pillars of credit-building and a key factor that credit bureaus and lenders consider is the length of your credit history, but building a good credit score takes time.For many cardholders, building credit with a credit card starts early. According to Experian\u2019s 2021 State of Credit report, the youngest generation of cardholders, Gen Zers, carry 1.7 credit cards, on average, with an outstanding balance of $2,312.Cardholders often don\u2019t have to wait until they\u2019re 18 to start building credit. Consumers can start working toward that goal early as an authorized user on a parent\u2019s credit card or with a student credit card and then grow into more complex credit cards as they learn to manage their credit and establish healthy financial habits.The same data from Experian shows just that. Over time, most consumers tend to see their credit scores trend upward. While the average Gen Zer\u2019s credit score sits at 660.5, Generation Y and Generation X have an average credit score of 667.4 and 685.2, respectively. Boomers and the Silent Generation have even higher average credit scores that sit well over 700.How credit cards impact your credit scoreCredit cards can play a key role in building and maintaining a strong credit score, but the number of cards doesn\u2019t always directly affect your score. A credit score is a number calculated by FICO, which stands for Fair Isaac Corporation, and others that predict how likely a borrower will repay a debt. It\u2019s based on information gathered by credit reporting agencies.Your FICO credit score ranges from 300 to 850, with a score on the low end considered \"poor\" and a score on the opposite end of the spectrum deemed \"excellent\" or \"exceptional.\"So how do the major credit bureaus calculate your credit score? Well, they consider a few different factors.Your payment history: 35%Building a record of consistently paying your debts on time is the single most important thing you can do to increase your credit score. It shows you regularly meet your financial obligations and lenders consider it a sign that lending you money is a low-risk undertaking.How much of your credit you use: 30%Lenders want to know how much of your available credit you\u2019re using, a measure known as your credit utilization ratio or credit utilization rate. Lenders consider a lower credit utilization ratio a sign that a borrower is paying their bills on time. It also shows how much credit you have available.Most experts agree that you should try to spend less than 30% of your total available credit. Pushing it lower, by paying your credit card balances in full each month if possible, is a practice that will boost your credit score, and lower your costs.Length of credit history: 15%Your score takes into account the average age of your accounts, the age of your oldest account, and the amount of time since you last opened a new account. Usually, the longer your credit history, the better your score\u2014if you\u2019ve taken care to make your payments on time and not spend more than you can afford along the way.New credit applications: 10%Credit card applications can hurt your credit score if you apply for multiple new cards in a short period of time. Every time you apply for a new credit card or loan, the lender will look closely at your credit history\u2014also known as a hard inquiry. These hard inquiries can cause your credit score to drop a few points\u2014for a period of time.A significant number of hard inquiries bunched together in time can be interpreted by lenders as a signal of unwise use of credit. Too many hard inquiries could not only ding your score, but it could make future lenders uneasy about doing business with you.Credit mix: 10%Your credit mix refers to the different types of revolving and installment debt that you carry. Lenders want to see that you\u2019re able to manage different types of debt. Unlike installment debt which has a set payoff date and balance, revolving debt only requires a minimum monthly payment and allows borrowers to use as much or as little credit as they want.When considering how many credit cards you should own, you should consider how adding a new card to your wallet will fit into your monthly budget as far as your minimum payment is concerned, when you last applied for a new card, as well as your other debt obligations.Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

With accident forgiveness coverage, though, your premiums will not increase after your first at-fault accident claim.Whether accident forgiveness is worth the added cost depends on how you structure your policy and what sort of protections are most important to you. Here\u2019s a deeper look at what accident forgiveness covers and whether you should consider adding this coverage option to your own policy.How accident forgiveness worksIn most cases, accident forgiveness applies only to the first accident you have or only one within so many years. It also generally only covers one accident per policy during that specific time period, not per driver. So if you get in an accident that\u2019s forgiven, and then another driver on your policy, like your spouse, gets in another at-fault accident, you can expect your premiums to go up as a result.It\u2019s important to keep in mind that your premiums may still increase at renewal time even if you qualify for accident forgiveness. That\u2019s because your carrier considers many factors when setting your car insurance rates. Accident forgiveness just ensures that your premiums aren\u2019t increasing because of a qualifying accident.Here are some other factors to consider about accident forgiveness.How much premiums go up after an accidentThe amount that your premiums increase after an accident varies depending on your carrier, location, coverage limits, and more. In some cases, you could see your premiums go up by 28% to 50% or more. Since no one can predict when an accident will occur, this can make accident forgiveness a pretty valuable feature on your car insurance policy.How long accidents stay on your driving recordIn general, an at-fault accident will be factored into your auto insurance premiums for about three years after the crash. Carriers may take into account the last three to five years of your driving record when setting your auto insurance rates, depending on the insurance company and even your state of registration.Carriers also factor in your claims history and driving record as part of their risk assessment process. They may look at accidents, non-collision claims, moving violations, and even arrests to evaluate you as a driver and potential customer. If you have an accident history, most DMV records will also note the severity of the crash and any resulting injuries, which can also lead to rate increases after an accident.Over time, you\u2019ll find that your premiums will gradually decrease as a result of a previous accident, as long as you aren\u2019t involved in another crash and maintain a good driving record.Is accident forgiveness worth it?The answer really lies in how much you\u2019re paying for your auto policy and how much this additional insurance feature costs. As with most insurance products, that varies.Some carriers include accident forgiveness as a complimentary perk for safe driving. Others add a surcharge for different options, which could include:Automatic accident forgiveness for small accidents, where the total damages fall below a certain threshold.Tiered accident forgiveness where loyal customers are rewarded after being an accident-free good driver for so many consecutive years.Immediate accident forgiveness coverage, which protects you against one accident per year or policy period.All this to say: If your carrier offers accident forgiveness protection for free, it\u2019s never a bad idea to take advantage of the additional coverage. If it\u2019s offered for a cost, it may still be worth considering, especially if you\u2019re already paying more than you want to spend for coverage. Having accident forgiveness on your auto insurance policy can give you peace of mind knowing you won\u2019t be further penalized. Yahoo Personal FinanceMore ways to manage costs after an accidentFollowing an accident \u2014 especially one that has impacted your premiums \u2014 there are things you can do to slowly bring the cost of your insurance coverage down. Obviously, maintaining a clean driving record is paramount; over time, as the accident moves further away in your record, it will become less pertinent to carriers when calculating premiums.You can also look into defensive driving classes, and many carriers offer insurance discounts for drivers willing to download and use telematics devices that track your driving habits.With auto insurance premiums on the rise, many drivers want to do everything they can to avoid future increases. Accident forgiveness coverage is one such option, helping you avoid potential premium jumps following an at-fault accident. While some carriers offer this protection to loyal and safe drivers at no cost, it may be worthwhile to purchase this coverage as a one-time \"get out of jail free\" card.","Article Anthor":"Stephanie Colestock","Article Date":"Tue, Oct 3, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"2":{"Article Title":"Powerball jackpot just hit $1.2 billion. Here's what you'd pocket after taxes.","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/powerball-jackpot-just-hit-12-billion-heres-what-youd-pocket-after-taxes-132352809.html","Article Content":"Oleg Blokhin via Getty ImagesAfter Saturday night's drawing came and went without a winner, the Powerball jackpot has ballooned to a staggering $1.2 billion (yes, billion with a b.) The next drawing is Wednesday, Oct. 4, and according to the Multi-State Lottery Association, it's the third largest jackpot in Powerball history.The last Powerball winning ticket was sold in California on July 19. Since then, there have been 32 consecutive drawings without a Powerball lottery winner.While the odds of becoming a Powerball winner are slim (1 in 292.2 million to be exact), it\u2019s hard to resist daydreaming about what you\u2019d do with all that money. But how much of the lottery prize would you take home after taxes? We\u2019ll break it down \u2013 and suggest five ways to safely invest your windfall.How are lottery winnings taxed?No matter how lucky you are, Uncle Sam will still come knocking. The IRS taxes lottery prizes differently depending on how the winner chooses to get paid. You have two choices: lump sum payout or annual payments spread over 30 years. In truth, most lottery winners opt for the cash lump sum upfront, even though it ultimately means fewer dollars in their pocket.What do federal taxes look like on a lump sum payment? The federal tax rate on any prize over $5,000 is 24%, which gets immediately deducted from your winnings. And for a large prize like the Powerball, that lump sum will also catapult you into the highest income tax bracket, so you\u2019ll pay the top federal tax rate of 37% the following year.The annuity option gives you the whole $1.2 billion pot over a longer time span, but you\u2019ll still see that 24% taken off the top of every payment. And for gigantic lottery prizes like the Powerball, you\u2019ll also be in the highest federal income bracket come tax time and have to pay any federal taxes you owe beyond that withholding.There\u2019s also the state tax billJust when you thought your windfall was safe, here come state taxes. How much you\u2019ll pay in state income taxes depends on where you live. New Yorkers pay the highest state tax rate at 13%, but the applicable state tax rate across the country varies from 2.9% to 8.82%.Of course if your luck holds, you might find yourself in one of the following states that doesn\u2019t charge state tax on income:AlaskaFloridaNew HampshireNevadaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasWyomingWashingtonWhat would you pocket after paying Powerball taxes?Counting your chickens before they hatch might be bad luck, but let\u2019s say you win that billion-dollar jackpot. If you choose the lump sum payout, you\u2019ll be paid $551.7 million up front.However, because your winnings are also subject to a 24% tax withholding, that cash value means you\u2019ll only walk away with $912 million to put in the bank. Depending on your filing status the following year, that sum is also subject to a tax rate as high as 37%, which means that money dwindles down significantly before you even file your state tax return.If you\u2019re willing to wait for three decades, the annual payments start at $18 million the first year and increase by 5% every year, topping $74 million by year 30. That's before federal taxes.If you want to run the numbers and see the fine print, you can use the Powerball Taxes Calculator to learn more.5 investments that make lottery winnings pay offEnough with the tax talk. Let\u2019s say you hit the jackpot (literally) and have joined the billionaires club. Here\u2019s what experts say lottery winners should do to maximize the winnings and secure a less stressful financial future.1.\u00a0Hire a financial adviserBefore you even roll up to claim the check, it makes sense to hire a financial adviser and a tax attorney or accountant who can help you manage your tax liabilities and invest money wisely.2. Diversify your banking strategyYou might think you're being responsible for stashing money in the bank, but remember banks are only insured for deposits up to $250,000. So be intentional about where you\u2019re putting your money and how you\u2019re splitting it up.Learn more about high-yield savings, money market, and CD savings accounts.Find the best HYSA rates3. Pay off outstanding debtsIt\u2019s going to be a big relief to live debt-free, potentially for the first time. Paying off outstanding loans like mortgages or credit card debt is generally a smart idea as it prevents interest from accumulating. However, keep an eye on your credit scores before leaning into living off cash on hand.4. Invest wiselyHaving extra income might tempt you to try new investment strategies, but be careful about jumping feet first into financial products you don\u2019t understand. Stick with low-risk investments like bonds and safer stocks or equities for the first few months before branching out \u2013 and get educated about the power of compound interest.5. Consider establishing a charitable foundationWhile you might choose to keep the fact that you won the lottery quiet, family and friends will inevitably find out. It\u2019s helpful to have a charitable foundation set up to deal with requests or gifting strategies that won\u2019t incur an additional tax burden.And last but not least, if you do win the Powerball, put your winnings to work living the dream without worrying about your bank account balance.","Article Anthor":"Kaz Weida","Article Date":"Tue, Oct 3, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"3":{"Article Title":"How does pay-per-mile car insurance work?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/pay-per-mile-car-insurance-220144560.html","Article Content":"Lyudinka via Getty ImagesIf you drive only occasionally, you may wonder if a standard car insurance policy is a waste of money. In most cases, it isn\u2019t because car insurance is required in all US states except New Hampshire.But if you\u2019re a low-mileage driver, it\u2019s worth exploring pay-per-mile car insurance as an alternative to a traditional policy that can lower the cost of your auto coverage.Here\u2019s how pay-per-mile coverage works, the pros and cons to be aware of, and whether it\u2019s worth it to switch.Understanding pay-per-mile insurancePay-per-mile auto insurance works differently than traditional auto insurance. Instead of paying a set rate based on your location, vehicle, driving history, and other factors, you pay a base rate and a per-mile rate. Your monthly base rate is determined by your demographic information and driving history, and it stays the same. However, your per-mile rate may fluctuate depending on the number of miles you drive each month.If you\u2019re a low-mileage driver who works from home, commutes a short distance or frequently relies on public transit, opting for pay-per-mile coverage could save you money. It can also be an attractive option for college students or retirees. But you\u2019ll generally have to drive less than 10,000 to 12,000 miles annually to save on car insurance costs.Pay-per-mile coverage options vary by insurer, but many companies offer both liability-only and full coverage policies. Popular pay-per-mile options include these carriers:MetromileMile AutoNationwide SmartMilesAllstate MilewisePros of pay-per-mile insuranceCost savings: The biggest benefit of pay-per-mile insurance programs is the potential savings compared to a traditional car insurance policy. Low-mileage drivers could save a significant sum on premiums.Flexible coverage: With a standard policy, you\u2019ll pay the same monthly or yearly auto insurance rate. But pay-per-mile coverage is more flexible, and your rate could be substantially lower if you drive less in a certain month.Potential discounts: Certain auto insurers offer discounts for those with pay-per-mile policies. For instance, you may be able to get a safe driving discount if you consistently follow the rules of the road.Cons of pay-per-mile insuranceLimited availability: Pay-per-mile auto coverage isn\u2019t available in all states, and availability may vary by insurer. Likewise, your car may not be compatible with the telematics devices many insurers require for pay-per-mile coverage.Not for high-mileage drivers: If you drive more than 10,000 to 12,000 miles each year, pay-per-mile auto insurance will likely be more costly than a standard auto policy.Privacy concerns: Pay-per-mile insurers typically require you to add a telematics device to your car to track your mileage and driving habits, including your speed, miles, time of day, driving events, and even your location. Not everyone wants their car insurance company tracking them that closely.Coverage limits: While some insurers may have a long-distance road trip exception for pay-per-mile policies, this isn\u2019t always the case. If you take road trips occasionally, read the fine print before getting pay-per-mile coverage.How pay-per-mile car insurance worksTypically, you\u2019ll need to install and use a telematics device in your car to track your mileage and driving behaviors if you opt for pay-per-mile insurance. These small devices often plug into your car\u2019s OBD-II port under the steering wheel. However, some insurers may allow you to take monthly photos of your odometer or download their mobile app for tracking as an alternative.Once you\u2019re up and running with tracking, you can drive as you normally would, and your insurer will charge you a fixed base rate and a variable, usage-based mileage rate each month. So let\u2019s say you pay a $35 base rate and a $0.06 per-mile rate in a given month. If you drive 135 miles that month, your insurance costs would be as follows:$35 + ($0.06 x 135) = $43.10Remember that if you drive a lot in a given month, your mileage rate may increase depending on your car insurance company. Ensure you familiarize yourself with rate structures before trading a standard insurance policy for a pay-per-mile program. Yahoo Personal FinanceIs pay-per-mile insurance worth it?Pay-per-mile insurance can be worthwhile for certain drivers to save on car insurance rates. But there are some important things to consider. If you\u2019re considering switching to pay-per-mile coverage, determine if this coverage is available in your area and which insurers offer it.You\u2019ll also want to evaluate your overall driving habits and track your mileage to determine if pay-per-mileage makes more sense than a standard auto policy. Consider whether the amount you drive changes month to month. If you find it does make sense, estimate potential cost savings by looking at your current policy and getting car insurance quotes from different providers.Finally, you\u2019ll want to consider which coverage options you want. For instance, do you drive an older, high-mileage car? If so, a liability-only policy may make sense. If your car is newer, a full coverage policy that includes liability, comprehensive, and collision insurance may offer the protection you need.","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"4":{"Article Title":"What is high-risk car insurance and who needs it?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/high-risk-car-insurance-194101085.html","Article Content":"S-S-S via Getty ImagesIf you\u2019re labeled a high-risk driver, you\u2019ll probably find that buying auto insurance coverage is both more difficult and more expensive than if you were shopping for a standard policy. Drivers can be classified by carriers as high risk because of factors such as age, driving record, or claims history.Understanding your own high-risk factors and how they impact your insurance premiums is vital to finding the right policy at the right price.Understanding high-risk car insuranceHigh-risk auto insurance, also known as non-standard auto insurance, is a type of policy designed for higher risk drivers, or those who have been categorized by the carrier as more likely to get in an accident or file a claim. Each carrier\u2019s definition and threshold of risk varies, but all may factor in your age, driving history, experience on the road, coverage history, and even the vehicle you drive.Nearly all states require a minimum amount of auto insurance coverage as a condition of owning and driving a vehicle. But because of these risk factors, certain drivers may be forced to purchase a high-risk car insurance policy instead of a standard policy.Because high-risk drivers are perceived as having a higher probability of claims and\/or at-fault accidents, these policies can be more limited in nature and are often more expensive. Not all carriers offer high-risk policies, either, so you may need to shop around for insurance quotes to find the right policy or even shop through your state\u2019s insurance marketplace.What puts a driver in a high-risk category?Insurance providers may determine a driver is high-risk who:Has a history of accidents and\/or comprehensive claimsHas received numerous traffic violations or has been convicted of serious violations like DWI (driving while intoxicated), DUI (driving under the influence), reckless driving, and moreIs required by their state insurance department to file an SR-22 certificate following a driver\u2019s license suspension or revocationHas no history of auto insurance or a large gap in coverageIs young and inexperienced behind the wheel, usually age 20 or youngerIs age 70 or olderHas a below-average credit score, outright bad credit or negative historyDrives certain high-value, high-risk, or specialized vehicles such as sports cars or antiquesWhile some carriers, like Progressive, go out of their way to avoid labeling drivers as \"high risk,\" having one or more of these factors will still influence your auto insurance rates and the types of coverage available to you.Effects of high-risk classification on car insurance costsInsurance carriers are all about mitigating risk, which is why your auto insurance premiums are personalized and largely based on these risk factors. If you have enough of these factors \u2014 or very serious ones \u2014 and are classified as a high-risk driver, your premiums will be even higher.Insurance companies reason that the more accidents you\u2019ve been involved in, the more likely you are to file a claim in the future. The same goes for drivers who have a history of DUI convictions or multiple speeding tickets, and even for less-serious factors such as limited driving experience or poor credit history.High-risk classification can follow you for multiple years, meaning multiple years of paying more for car insurance coverage. To keep costs down, you can lower your policy limits and raise your deductible, or opt for liability-only insurance instead of full coverage. But keep in mind that lower coverage levels and higher deductibles can mean higher out-of-pocket expenses if you\u2019re in an accident.It\u2019s wise to shop around and compare quotes anytime you are in the market for auto insurance coverage. If you\u2019re forced to buy a non-standard policy or have factors that make you a high-risk driver, this is even more important. Yahoo Personal FinanceWays to mitigate your high-risk classificationBeing labeled a high-risk driver makes insurance more expensive, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t things you can do to mitigate costs and reduce your high-risk classification over time.Improve (or maintain) your driving record. Your driving record includes your history of accidents, moving violations, and previous claims. If you are deemed a high-risk driver due to your driving record, you will need to \"wait out\" many of these blemishes (most carriers only consider the last three to five years\u2019 worth). Even if your risk status is due to something else, maintaining a clean driving record can only help reduce your premiums and prevent other factors from impacting your coverage options.Choose a practical vehicle. An unsafe, high-value, or specialty vehicle can increase your premiums and even bump you into a high-risk classification. Instead, consider switching to a safer and\/or more practical vehicle. Adding safety features can also help you qualify for discounts on your policy.Watch your credit score. While a carrier cannot deny you auto insurance coverage due to credit history alone, in many states your credit score can affect your premiums. Make sure that you are maintaining reasonable credit utilization and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, limiting hard inquiries and new accounts, and avoiding late payments.Take a defensive driving course. Many insurance companies offer discounts and rate reductions for drivers who complete defensive driving courses. Anything you can do to show insurance companies you\u2019re a safe driver is a plus.Don\u2019t let your coverage lapse. If you\u2019re stuck buying a high-risk policy at a higher premium, it can be tempting to forgo coverage altogether. This is especially true if you don\u2019t own your own car or rarely drive. However, a lapse in insurance coverage \u2014 regardless of the reason \u2014 can actually increase your risk level and, in turn, raise your premiums in the future. Instead of creating a gap in coverage, consider buying a pay-per-mile or liability-only policy, especially if you don\u2019t drive much.Non-standard insurance and other alternativesIf you\u2019re struggling with exorbitant insurance premiums or to find coverage at all, here are some alternatives to consider.Look into state-run insurance pools. Also known as assigned risk pools, state-run programs help link drivers with carriers willing to offer them coverage after they\u2019ve been denied elsewhere. These policies are still expensive but can provide you with coverage when you haven\u2019t had luck applying directly.Non-standard insurance companies. While high-risk auto insurance is sometimes referred to as a non-standard policy, there are also carriers which are categorized as non-standard insurance companies. These companies specialize in providing coverage to drivers with special concerns or needs, such as those requiring an SR-22 certificate, who are high-risk drivers, or who need a non-owner policy. These carriers often advertise themselves as being geared toward non-standard drivers and include companies like The General and Dairyland.Get added to someone else\u2019s policy. In some cases, it may be cheaper (and easier) to get added to someone else\u2019s existing auto insurance policy as a named driver, especially if you don\u2019t own a vehicle. If you occasionally borrow your parents\u2019 car, for example, they may be able to add you to their policy. Their premiums will likely see a big increase, but this may still be less than you\u2019d pay for your own policy (especially if you\u2019re denied coverage).If you\u2019re still finding it difficult to secure affordable rates due to your high-risk driver classification, it may be time to call in some professional help. Some insurance agents and brokers specialize in working with high-risk drivers to find and build a policy that meets their needs.","Article Anthor":"Stephanie Colestock","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"5":{"Article Title":"The best personal loans for September 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/best-personal-loans-202034980.html","Article Content":"Personal loans are a fast way to fund a cash need. The best personal loan lenders will offer borrowers the lowest rates, loan approval for as little as hundreds of dollars to as much as $100,000 and issue the loan funds quickly \u2014 sometimes the next day.Personal loan rates have been rising, but APRs can be as low as just under 5% to over 11% or more. Your credit score and payment history will impact the interest rate you earn.Here's how to find the best personal loan with affordable monthly payments to meet your financial goals.How does a personal loan work?A personal loan is a type of loan issued in one lump-sum by a bank, credit union or online lender. The best personal loans most often require only your signature, proof of steady income and a review of your credit history. You'll make monthly payments for the loan term.One of the most popular personal loan purposes is for debt consolidation. That's when you pay off higher interest rate credit card debt and erase the multiple payments with a single monthly payment on a lower fixed-interest-rate personal loan.But the best personal loans can do much more. With fair credit, you can fund car repairs, pay off medical expenses or finance home improvement projects and repairs. There are few limitations to the loan purposes of personal loans.The best personal loans share many, if not all, of the following perks:The best personal loan benefitsVersatility. The best personal loans come in a variety of lump-sum amounts, and the loan funds can be used for many financial goals. Repayment terms may be fine-tuned to your monthly cash flow.No collateral required. Usually, unsecured personal loans are the most attractive to borrowers. Qualifying for an unsecured loan means you won't have to put up your home, vehicle or other personal property to guarantee the loan.Lower interest rates than credit cards. With good credit, you'll likely earn an interest rate lower than you'll see on credit cards. And credit cards and home equity lines of credit usually have variable rates that have been moving higher recently. Personal loans often have fixed interest rates that don't change.Easier to qualify for. The best personal loans have lower eligibility standards than major loans like a home mortgage. Lenders qualifying borrowers with a wide range of credit scores are a bonus.Fast funding. The best personal loan lenders have funding times as soon as the next day following loan approval.Personal loan drawbacksYour interest rate might be higher than expected. Because many personal loans are unsecured, your interest rate might take a toll on your budget. Consider the pros and cons of secured versus unsecured personal loans.Be aware of fees. Some lenders can sting you with multiple charges, like an origination fee and a prepayment penalty. Be on the watch for such nuisance fees during the application process.More debt. Let's face it. Personal loans can be just one more thing to pay off. If you have a good to excellent credit score and manage debt well, you're fine. But for those struggling in their current financial situation with a low credit score, think it through before taking on more debt.Features of the best personal loansThe best personal loans have a low fixed rate, offer a loan amount suitable for your financial goals, with affordable-for-you repayment terms. Outstanding personal loan lenders will also limit nuisance fees and offer credit score flexibility and responsive customer support.Let's consider the loan options that define the best personal loans.Interest rates and APRInterest rates charged for personal loans have been rising recently, a byproduct of the higher rates instituted by the Federal Reserve's effort to tame inflation. However, while the trend for personal loan rates has been moving higher, the rate you receive is based on your credit profile. The best personal loan lenders will offer borrowers the most competitive loan offers.Lenders will consider your credit score, which is a measure of your creditworthiness based on your history of repaying debt, such as credit card debt, vehicle loans and a home mortgage, if you have one.They will also review your debt-to-income ratio. That compares how much you owe on existing debt to your pre-tax earnings.Lenders call this risk-based pricing. They charge more interest (and fees) to borrowers with poor credit that seem to be at a higher risk of nonpayment. Excellent credit borrowers earn lower personal loan rates. The lower your interest rate, the less you pay to borrow money, and the easier it is to afford your monthly payment.You'll often see an interest rate quoted as an APR. The annual percentage rate is your yearly cost of borrowing money and includes any fees or other charges. Looking at the APR ranges offered to you is an excellent way to compare lenders and find your best borrowing deal.Loan amount and termsYour best personal loan choice will be based on your needs and the repayment terms from the lender who meets your financing goals.Borrow what you need, no more. Lenders who identify a qualified borrower are anxious to offer the maximum loan amount they believe the customer can afford. That can be more than you need and put you on the hook for higher debt. For example, if you need $7,000 and the lender gives you a loan approval of $10,000 because of your good credit, stick with the $7,000. The average amount of an unsecured personal loan was $7,100 in the first quarter of 2023, according to TransUnion.Consider what monthly payment you can really afford. The loan terms are the amount you'll pay each month and the number of months those payments will be required. The best personal loan will feature payment options with the shortest term length that allows a monthly installment payment you're comfortable with.Personal loan fees and chargesAs with borrowing any debt, the interest rate, fees and other charges are the differences that separate lenders.Take your time during the application process. You can save yourself hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars over the loan term. Personal loan fees and charges to look for can include:A prepayment penalty. A fee is levied if you pay the loan off early. In effect, you're being penalized for reducing debt. Avoid a prepayment penalty if you can.Origination fee. An extra charge to pad the lender's profit. It is usually a percentage of the total loan, for example, 1% or 5%.Application fee. Another nuisance fee. It's usually around $25 to $50 but can be as high as $500. You\u2019re actually paying to submit a loan application.Document fees. A fee for processing the paperwork of your loan application. It shouldn't be much, but again, another junk fee.The best personal loan lenders won't charge most of the fees above.Late payment fee. You can't avoid this one. If you don't pay on time, you'll get hit with a late fee. Getting behind on monthly payments will also negatively impact your credit score.Ask questions before you get a loan offer. There may be a lot of paperwork involved in the application process for your personal loan. If there's something you don't quite understand before loan approval, take time to get an answer from the lender.Credit score and eligibilityYou will want to know your credit score and credit history well before qualifying for a personal loan. That way, you can correct any errors or try to clean up any blemishes.The higher your credit score, the better your personal loan terms and the lower your monthly payment will be. Credit scores generally range from 300 to 850. Experian data reported the average FICO score in the U.S. was 714 in the third quarter of 2022.Current interest rates from a major lender, PenFed Credit Union, range from an annual percentage rate of 7.74% to 17.99%. That's just one example. Top-tier credit scores will earn the most favorable interest rate.Some lenders will consider issuing personal loans to borrowers with bad credit. Of course, your repayment terms will be less favorable, and the interest rate will be higher. The installment payments may be out of your reach.Lender customer service and reputationYour lender choice is important. You want to find a provider with a good reputation, the services and perks you prefer and the most favorable loan terms. Shady, predatory lenders can put on a good front, but you want to peek behind the curtain and lower your risk of dealing with a \"bait and switch\" lender. That\u2019s when you\u2019re promised a tempting loan offer that turns out to have a much higher interest rate than you expected and requires monthly payments that you might not be able to afford.For the best personal loan:Look for lenders that allow pre-qualification. That means you'll get a solid loan offer with detailed repayment terms before you make a borrowing commitment. You can compare personal loan interest rates among multiple lenders before starting the official application process.Investigate customer support. Does the lender offer an autopay option, allowing monthly payments to be drafted from your checking account? If so, does that provide you with an autopay discount and a slightly lower interest rate? Is there phone and email support during the hours you'll most likely need assistance?Read customer reviews. Real-life reviews offer the best view of a lender's reputation. Sort the reviews by \"most recent,\" if possible, to see the latest issues or complaints. Red flags can include last-minute changes to a borrower's interest rate or loan terms just before document signing, disbursement or installment payment processing glitches, or issues with the functionality of a mobile app or website.Best place to get a personal loanUltimately, the best personal loan lender will listen to your needs and financial goals. You'll receive favorable loan terms that reflect your creditworthiness, and be treated with consideration and respect.You might choose an online lender for a wide variety of payment options and delivery of loan funds the next business day. A financial institution where you keep a bank account may be eager to expand its financial relationship with you and offer the lowest APR. Or, a credit union may provide the best combination of service and loan terms.It's all a matter of shopping lenders and loan offers. If you think about your largest purchases, say a vehicle or big-screen television \u2014 a personal loan can rank right up there with the biggest financial decisions you'll make.Sure, you'll have the money in your hands for a moment. But then the monthly payments begin, with the loan amount mushrooming with fees and interest.How to apply for a personal loanFirst, know your credit score. That's the credit profile that helps determine your interest rate. An excellent credit score earns the best rates. Credit bureaus often offer free FICO credit scores through financial providers.Consider the amount of money you want to borrow. Be realistic. Get what you need. A smaller loan typically has a shorter term length. Maximum loan amounts require monthly payments for a longer time and may impact your creditworthiness for future borrowing.Prequalify with two or three lenders. For a pre-qualification, you'll want to ask for a soft credit check that won't affect your credit score. See how the initial loan offers shake out. Keep an eye out for the lowest rates.Don't rush your decision. Once you have two or three loan offers in hand, sit down and do a side-by-side comparison of each. Which lender gives you the best payment options and combination of loan terms and service? How much will you save over the life of the loan from the lowest APR offer compared to the least favorable? How quickly will the loan funds be available?Apply with the best personal loan lender for you. With an online application, the lender will order a full credit report, including your credit score. That may affect your creditworthiness, so be sure this is the lender you want to work with. Once you\u2019ve completed the approval process and received loan approval, the disbursement should be issued in days, with some lenders offering next-day funding. Monthly payments will soon begin.FAQsHow does a personal loan work?A personal loan is a lump-sum installment loan issued by a bank, credit union or online lender, the best personal loans most often require only your signature, proof of steady income and a review of your credit history. You'll make monthly payments for the loan term. You can use a personal loan for a variety of uses, but are generally prohibited from using one to pay off student loans, put a down payment on a home, or for investing purposes.Can I get a personal loan with bad credit?Yes, there are personal loan lenders with flexible credit score requirements that cater to borrowers with bad credit. However, you'll likely pay at least an above-average interest rate. Or, the lender may require a cosigner, joint application or a secured loan guaranteed by collateral. The term length may be longer, as well.Can I apply for a personal loan with no credit check?A no-credit-check lender will likely offer smaller loans, shorter repayment terms and high interest rates. A secured loan with collateral may be an eligibility requirement. It can be a risky financing option. Payday lenders and buy-here-pay-here car lots are examples of no-credit-check lenders. Borrowers should know that such loans are best used for emergencies \u2014 and only if they have bad credit and few other loan options.Can I use a personal loan to pay off credit card debt?Absolutely. It's one of the most common purposes for a personal loan. Called a debt-consolidation loan, it requires a personal loan with an interest rate significantly lower than the annual percentage rates you're paying on outstanding credit card debt. Paying off high-interest rate debt with a debt consolidation loan can have a long-term positive effect on a borrower's credit score.","Article Anthor":"Hal Bundrick","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"6":{"Article Title":"Prequalified vs. preapproved credit card offers: What\u2019s the difference?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/prequalified-vs-preapproved-credit-card-180909329.html","Article Content":"Yurii Karvatskyi via Getty ImagesThe offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money.So you\u2019ve received a letter congratulating you for getting prequalified or preapproved for a new credit card. The offer almost seems too good to be true. Just fill out the application, drop it in the mailbox, and wait a few weeks for your new card to arrive, right? Unfortunately, that\u2019s not how it works.Being prescreened, preselected, prequalified, or preapproved for a new line of credit does not guarantee your application will be approved by the bank or financial institution \u2014 it simply means you meet their initial requirements.So what\u2019s the difference between prequalified and preapproved, and are they actually meaningful? Let\u2019s examine this phrasing to help you understand those offers when you receive them.Credit card prequalification vs. preapprovalAlthough the terms are closely related, prequalified and preapproved credit card offers are not the same. If you\u2019ve received either type of offer, it means that a lender has reviewed your credit history and determined that you\u2019re a likely fit for its product. However, preapproved offers are often a better indicator that your credit card application will be successful.Both of these offers effectively reveal little more than eligibility. Some banks and credit card issuers use the words \"prequalified\" and \"preapproved\" interchangeably \u2014 hence why you may occasionally receive \"prequalified\" correspondence through the mail.What does prequalified mean?The prequalification process often begins with you, the customer.For example, many bank websites allow you to see if you\u2019re prequalified for their best credit cards before you apply. This initial application does not require a hard credit pull (which can impact your credit score), though they may run a soft credit check. Instead, you\u2019ll often be asked to enter your annual income and other basic financial information so the credit card issuer can assess whether you\u2019re a good candidate for that specific credit card.What does preapproved mean?Preapproved credit card offers generally show up in your physical and virtual mailboxes entirely unsolicited. In some cases, you may have never even heard of the card issuer before.With credit card preapproval, you can bet that the credit card company has more closely examined your credit report than with a prequalification. There\u2019s a reason for this: Credit card issuers ask credit bureaus for an index of people with specific credit activity to help them narrow down worthy applicants.This is why these card offers might appear to know you eerily well. For example, if you\u2019ve got good credit or carrying around $10,000 in credit card debt, you could receive a mailer encouraging you to consolidate $10,000 worth of debt onto a balance transfer credit card such as the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card or U.S. Bank Visa\u00ae Platinum Card. The bank may have specifically requested a list of those with credit card debt of around $10,000 within a specific credit range. Customers who fit the profile may receive a \"preapproved\" offer.Thanks to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), a financial institution can\u2019t send you a preapproved offer unless it includes a \"firm offer.\" In other words, if you are approved for the card, you\u2019ll get the exact terms specified in the preapproval letter.What are preselected or prescreened credit card offers?To make matters more complicated, you may see the term \"preselected\" or \"prescreened\" in your mail. Put simply, you loosely fit a criteria the bank is trying to target. Issuers preselect customers using data similar to the preapproval process, but a successful application is less of a sure thing.For example, a business owner may get preapproved for The American Express Blue Business Cash\u2122 Card, but a frequent traveler may receive a letter in the mail for the American Express\u00ae Gold Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card.Do preapproved and prequalified offers affect your credit score?Receiving preapproved and prequalified offers do not affect your credit score, but accepting the offers and submitting an application will. Here\u2019s why.Soft credit inquiryAlso known as a soft credit check or pull, lenders may do a soft credit pull when deciding whether to preapprove or prequalify you for a credit card. This type of inquiry does not impact your credit score.Hard credit inquiryA hard credit check or pull signifies to the credit bureaus that you\u2019re actively trying to acquire new credit. You can expect your credit score to dip by a few points every time you experience a hard inquiry. This is because the credit card issuer will review how you\u2019ve handled debt and credit in the past and use that information (along with other criteria) to decide to approve or deny you the line of credit.For example, if you\u2019re preapproved for a credit card, the issuer has almost certainly performed a soft inquiry on your score to see if you\u2019re a suitable candidate. If you decide to submit an application for the card, the issuer will then perform a hard inquiry, which will temporarily lower your credit score by a few points.Pros and cons to prequalified and preapproved offersThere are several wins that come with prequalified and preapproved offers. They\u2019re more than just tools to help you understand your approval odds for a specific credit card.Preselected offers also give you the ability to \"rate shop.\" This is the act of finding the best terms on different credit cards before you commit. For example, when you prequalify for a card, the lender will often perform a soft credit inquiry and present you with ballpark interest rates based on your credit. You can do this with as many credit cards as allow for prequalification to find the option that\u2019s best for you.There are tradeoffs, however. The frequent junk mail can accumulate quickly. And snail mail can contain information that could potentially help a scammer to commit identity theft.How to opt out of preapproved credit card offersIf you\u2019d prefer to spare the square acre that\u2019s deforested annually for the purpose of sending you garish advertisements, the FCRA offers a solution:Opt out electronically by visiting OptOutPrescreen.com or calling 888-567-8688. This will remove you from credit prescreening lists for five years.Opt out by mail (you must print and sign an opt-out election). This will remove you from credit prescreening lists permanently.However, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, credit card issuers can still acquire your information from alternate sources and continue to target you for financial products.From offer to approvalYour credit score and history play an important role in determining what kind of credit card offers you're eligible for. Both prequalification and preapproval offers give you an idea of your approval odds without affecting your credit score. But until you submit that credit card application and consent to a hard credit inquiry, you can\u2019t know for sure.Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

The Fed's latest quarter-point rate hike on July 26 has led to some positive interest rate changes across personal finance tools, including savings accounts.For Americans thinking about opening a high-yield savings account (sometimes referred to as a high-interest savings account), interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are on the rise and could go even higher. Take a look at some of the best rates available from our list of federally insured banks below.What is a high-yield savings account?High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) are a type of deposit account offered by brick-and-mortar banks, neobanks (online-only banks with no physical branches) as online savings accounts, and by state or federal credit unions. As with traditional savings accounts, HYSA account holders typically don\u2019t have debit card access or check-writing privileges, but may be able to transfer money between their HYSA and checking account with an ATM card or online.HYSAs have some of the highest rates available when it comes to financial products. An HYSA functions similarly to a traditional savings account, except you can earn much more interest. In some cases, you can get an annual percentage yield (APY) that is 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate.High-yield savings accounts typically have no minimum opening balance or monthly fees, though some banks may require you to maintain a certain minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge.Depending on the financial institution, you may earn the same rate regardless of your balance, or your APY may be tiered based on your balance.What is APY?A high-yield savings account\u2019s rate measures the simple interest \u2014 or interest earned on the principal you deposit in the account. APY is the rate of return earned on your savings account, including compound interest. Compound interest is the interest you earn on the money you deposit and the interest you earn on that money. Most savings accounts and CDs compound daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow.While HYSAs have some of the highest APYs available, those rates are variable. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY \u2014 your rate may be great when you first open the account and then gradually decrease. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates.Where should I open a high-yield account?You can open a high-yield savings account at a financial institution, local bank, or credit union (it may also be possible to open an account online without visiting a branch, but that can vary by institution). Accounts at traditional banks may be subject to higher or more frequent fees, which often go to the upkeep of the branch locations. You also may be subject to any monthly withdrawal limits your bank may have in place.Because there\u2019s no physical location with overhead costs to pay for, many online-only banks are able to offer HYSAs with higher APYs, and often don\u2019t charge service fees \u2014 plus, you can easily open and manage your account completely online or with an app.Pros of high-yield savings accountsHigher interest rates: You\u2019ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account.Compounding interest: Interest compounds, helping you grow your savings. With interest earned via a high interest rate, your savings will grow exponentially.Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash your emergency fund, as your money remains accessible. Some accounts, like certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money earlier than planned when you open the account. Some accounts even offer ATM cards for easier access.No or minimal fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won\u2019t need to worry about costs eating into your balance.Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), making them a very low-risk option for your money. FDIC insurance \u2014 NCUA insurance for credit unions \u2014 is government-backed insurance on bank accounts up to $250,000, which protects your savings if your bank or credit union encounters financial trouble.Cons of high-yield savings accountsVariable rates: Your savings account\u2019s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates, they\u2019re loosely tied to the Federal Reserve's official interest rates. Banks may opt to decrease savings rates when the fed funds rate goes down.Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit.Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So while a $5,000 deposit isn\u2019t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY.Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren\u2019t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns.Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals.Tips on finding the best high-yield savings accountCompetitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs.New account offersLook at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open.High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account.Required depositsResearch applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount?FeesSome accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account.AccessibilityUnderstand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network?Deposit optionsReview available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM?Account linkingLook into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to being able to access your money.How to open a high-yield savings accountOnce you\u2019ve determined the best high-yield savings account rates \u2014 don\u2019t forget to make sure you\u2019re only looking at accounts from member FDIC or NCUA institutions \u2014 and found a high-yield savings account that works for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You\u2019ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver\u2019s license, Social Security card or Individual Tax Identification Number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill.Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement.","Article Anthor":"Yahoo Personal Finance","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"8":{"Article Title":"How to choose the best savings account for your kid","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/best-savings-account-for-kids-213224878.html","Article Content":"It's never too early to start teaching your child healthy financial habits. One easy way is to open a savings account for your child. Teaching your little one the value of a dollar and how to manage even small amounts of money properly are valuable personal finance lessons.Savings accounts can be a valuable tool in learning to set savings goals, track progress toward important money goals, and learn about the power of compound interest. Here are some things to remember when looking for the best savings accounts for kids.What is a children's savings account?A children's savings account is a type of savings account geared toward savers under age 18. Kids savings accounts fall into one of two categories:Joint account: A joint account is a savings account owned and managed by both the child and parent. This means that the parent and child have equal access to the account and can make deposits, withdrawals, and more.Custodial account: A custodial account is a savings account you manage for your child. In this case, your child is a beneficiary until they take ownership of their account once they become an adult.With joint and custodial accounts, many banks and credit unions offer savers the option to transition to a regular savings account once they become adults.One of the significant perks of starting early and opting for one of these account types is that you can teach your child about money management. Once your kids learn to save, they can transition to more complex financial products as adults, like managing a credit card, using a checking account, or saving money in a money market account.Where to open an account for your childThere are several types of savings accounts you can choose for your child. The right choice will ultimately depend on the kind of banking experience you want, if you wish to stick with your current financial institution, and the perks you value.A basic savings account at your bank: Most banks offer a traditional savings account, a standard deposit account in which you can put money and earn interest on your balance. The annual percentage yield (APY) you can expect to earn on that balance will vary from bank to bank.A savings account with your credit union: Credit unions differ from traditional banks because they are not-for-profit institutions. These financial institutions are run by members and for members. As such, you (or a family member) will likely need to be a member of a credit union to open a savings account for your child. The upside: because these institutions are run by members, you'll likely pay lower or zero extra fees to run and maintain your account. Although, you should be aware that credit unions may have fewer physical branches compared to a larger bank, as well as a smaller ATM network. Credit unions may also charge a membership fee for banking with them.An online-only savings account: Anyone can apply for an online-only bank account right from their laptop or smartphone. One major perk of an online savings account is lower fees thanks to no overhead costs for brick-and-mortar locations, which can also mean higher interest rates. Like credit unions, an online-only savings account may not have an extensive ATM network, or any ATM network. You'll also want to ask whether your account will come with a physical ATM or debit card.No matter which type of institution you choose to bank with, you must confirm its membership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). You might see this designation at the end of the institution's name as \"member FDIC\" or \"member NCUA.\" Still, you should confirm with the official websites via the FDIC's BankFind tool or the NCUA's credit union research tool.When your deposit account is FDIC- or NCUA-insured, your deposits are federally insured up to $250,000 per depositor or credit union member, per ownership category. This way, if your bank fails, your money is protected.How to find the best savings account for kidsNot all savings accounts are the same. You should consider several details when choosing a starter savings account for your child.What's required to open and maintain your savings account?When you open a new savings account, pay attention to the fine print. Your bank or credit union may have specific requirements in order to open an account. You might be required to make a minimum opening deposit, maintain a minimum balance in your account to keep it open or pay a recurring fee for account maintenance and services.There may also be stipulations about the minimum age necessary to open an account.Are there any fees associated with this savings account?In many cases, savings accounts designed for kids don't usually charge additional fees. However, you should still ask your financial institution if there are any monthly maintenance fees or penalties you should be aware of. This could also be a good lesson for your child in understanding the terms and conditions of their accounts before agreeing to them.Kids accounts usually don't charge monthly fees, but it's still good to watch for any potential charges.Capital One, for example, offers a Kids Savings Account that doesn't charge any monthly or maintenance fees and doesn't require a minimum balance.Is it an interest-bearing account?Selecting an account that earns a high interest rate will help your child\u2019s savings grow faster and teach them that it pays to save. Showing them how much they can earn over time may incentivize them to set aside more money now.If you go with a high-yield savings account, your child's savings can grow exponentially over time \u2014 even with a smaller balance.For example, Alliant Credit Union's Kids Savings Account is currently offering a 3.10% APY, which is more than seven times the national average.What kinds of parental controls come with this savings account?Your financial institution will recognize that your child needs hand-holding as they navigate their first savings account. As such, you might find that your child's savings account comes with specific parental controls built in.When selecting an account, read up on the settings and features of that account to determine if it's the right fit for you and your child. Many accounts come with a debit card or prepaid card that your child can use to make withdrawals or pay for items on their own.Certain bank accounts will give you the option to set withdrawal limits on your child's account or add a certain limit to a prepaid debit card so that they aren't regularly dipping into their savings. You may also be able to set up text alerts to stay up to date on your child's savings account balance and transactions.Does this account come with any extra features or mobile app capabilities?The goal of a starter savings account is ultimately to give your child a strong foundation and guide them so that they can manage their personal finances down the line.Many financial products geared toward younger consumers offer financial literacy and budgeting tools online or within your banking app. Giving your child access to their account via a mobile app and showing them how to monitor their balance, and deposit their allowance or a birthday check is one way to give them an added layer of financial independence and allow them to start taking ownership of their personal finances.Opening a savings account for your childCreating a new savings account for your child is a simple process. If you're already a customer and plan to open a savings account with your current bank or credit union, you should be able to do so fairly easily.Remember, you'll need to be a co-owner of the account, so you'll need to provide both your information and your child's information if you aren't already banking with that particular bank or credit union.Some key information your financial institution will ask you for includes some form of personal identification for your child, such as:Birth certificateSocial security cardDriver's license or state ID (if your child is a teen or old enough to drive)PassportMake sure your account grows with your childThe best savings account will be the one that grows with your child over time. In most cases, your bank or credit union will transition your child's savings account into a regular savings account that they can then have sole ownership of and manage on their own once they reach age 18.Some banks may even offer account options that you can switch to before then that cater to teens or college students. Ask your financial institution about the options they offer for a longer-term account, once your child is of age.A kids savings account can serve as a building block in your child's lifelong journey with their personal finances. When teaching your child about money management, part of teaching they how to manage their money involves having important conversations about where they keep their money and how carefully choosing an account can make all the difference as they work to reach their money goals.","Article Anthor":"Ivana Pino","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"9":{"Article Title":"How to find the best checking accounts for September 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/find-best-checking-accounts-234120614.html","Article Content":"A checking account is an essential tool in your financial life. It\u2019s where you deposit your paychecks and how you pay your bills. And if you have the wrong checking account for your needs, you could end up paying unnecessary fees.The best checking account offers feature perks such as low minimum balances, no monthly fees, overdraft protection, and widespread ATM networks so you can access your money without added charges. What options are available vary by institution, so here is what you should look for when trying to find the best checking account for you.1. Understand your needsAll checking accounts have the same basic features: They allow you to deposit and withdraw money, and you can withdraw via check, debit card, or electronic transfer. But what kind of account is a good fit for you is based on your banking preferences.There are several types of checking accounts. Depending on the bank you choose, you may have the following options:Student checking: These accounts are intended for children or college students. They usually have low minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees.Senior checking: Senior accounts are for older adults, such as those 55 and older. They have low balance requirements, and they rarely have monthly fees.Free checking: A free checking account is open to anyone 18 or older. These accounts do not have monthly fees, so you can accept and make payments without paying service fees.Interest checking: Most checking accounts are not interest-bearing, so the money you keep in there won\u2019t grow. However, some interest-bearing checking accounts allow you to earn interest, but they often have monthly fees or balance requirements.Rewards checking: A rewards checking account allows account holders to earn cash back or points on purchases. For example, you may earn 1% cash back on purchases made with your debit card. However, you usually must maintain a certain balance or complete a minimum number of transactions to qualify for the rewards.2. Research financial institutionsOnce you know the type of checking account you want, you can decide where to open it. You can open a checking account with either a credit union or bank.Credit union: Credit unions are nonprofit organizations, and you have to become a member to open an account. Because credit unions are nonprofits, their accounts tend to have lower checking account fees and better rates than for-profit banking institutions.Bank: Banks are financial institutions that are privately owned institutions licensed to offer bank accounts and loans. They typically operate multiple branches in several states, and some offer their services nationwide.Besides those two main categories, you can also choose between online and traditional institutions.A neobank or credit union allows you to open an account entirely online. Since an online bank doesn\u2019t have physical branches, it has lower overhead costs, and it can pass those savings on to customers through lower fees and higher annual percentage yields (APYs). But they don\u2019t have local branches you can visit when you need help.Traditional banks and credit unions often have online account management tools, but they also operate branches. They tend to have higher fees and lower APYs, but you can visit any branch to withdraw or deposit money.Regardless of which type of institution you choose, make sure it\u2019s backed by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Member FDIC and member NCUA organizations provide deposit insurance up to $250,000, protecting your money if your bank or credit union fails.3. Compare fees and chargesChecking account fees vary by financial institution, so review the deposit account agreement for the checking account you\u2019re considering to review all qualifying fees. The deposit account agreement is usually available through a link at the bottom of the checking account\u2019s page in the fine print. If you can\u2019t find it, email the bank or visit a branch in person and request it. Common fees and terms to look out for include the following:Monthly service fees: Monthly service fees, sometimes referred to as account or monthly maintenance fees, are what some banks charge to keep your account active. You pay the monthly fee even if you didn\u2019t complete any transactions.Fee waivers: Some banks will waive the monthly fee if you meet certain criteria, such as maintaining a minimum balance or setting up direct deposit.Overdraft fees: Banks and credit unions charge overdraft fees when your account balance isn\u2019t high enough to cover online or debit card purchases you make. The fee for an overdrawn account can be steep \u2014 according to the FDIC, it\u2019s typically around $35 per transaction.Non-sufficient fund fees: Non-sufficient fund fees are similar to overdraft fees. They occur when you write a check for more than you have in your checking account. The bank will decline the transaction but charge you the non-sufficient fund fee.ATM fees: Generally, banks and credit unions provide fee-free ATMs (in-network). But if you use out-of-network ATMs, they may charge you a fee (in addition to the service charges the ATM operator charges for using its machines).4. Think about interest ratesChecking accounts usually aren\u2019t interest-bearing accounts, but there are some institutions that offer interest on checking accounts. However, the typical APY on these accounts is much lower than what you\u2019d get with a traditional savings account.These accounts tend to have monthly fees or high minimum balance requirements, so they usually only make sense for those who keep a substantial amount of money in a checking account to cover their monthly expenses. Otherwise, your money will work harder for you in a high-yield savings account (HYSA).5. Consider added features and servicesSome banks and credit unions offer their customers additional features and services. For example:Mobile banking: Mobile banking apps are increasingly popular, especially if you like to keep an eye on debit card transactions and your daily balance, but not all banks have their own yet. If you prefer to use your phone for banking, check the bank or credit union\u2019s mobile app availability.ATM fee reimbursements: Some banks and credit unions provide customers with rebates for out-of-network ATM fees. For example, you may be eligible for up to $20 per statement cycle in ATM withdrawal fee rebates.Free checks: Many banks and credit unions will issue customers their first box of paper checks for free.Online bill pay: Many banks and credit unions have online bill pay services that allow you to pay your utilities, credit card bills, and even subscription bills through your account. You can also schedule those payments in advance and set up recurring payments.How to open a checking accountNow that you know what factors affect the best checking accounts, you can pick a bank and open your new account.Whether you open the account online or in person, you will generally need to provide information about yourself so the bank can verify your identity. Below is a checklist of information and documentation you should have handy to open a checking account:Identification, such as a driver\u2019s license or passportA second form of identification, such as your Social Security card, birth certificate, or utility bills listing your name and addressYour Social Security number or taxpayer identification numberMoney for the initial deposit (typically between $25 and $100)You need to fill out an application to open the account. The bank will verify your information and run a deposit account inquiry through a system like ChexSystems. If the bank or credit union approves your application, you can start using your account immediately, but it may take a few days to receive your debit card and checks. If you\u2019re employed and receive monthly direct deposits, make sure you reach out to your HR or accounting department with your new banking information.Frequently asked questionsDo checking accounts earn interest?Interest-earning checking accounts do exist. Unfortunately, high interest checking accounts are rare \u2014 most checking accounts have a low APY. Based on the most recent data from the FDIC, interest-earning checking accounts have an average APY of 0.07%.If you\u2019re looking for an FDIC-insured account that offers high interest rates, a high-yield savings account may be a better option for your personal finance goals.Can I have two checking accounts at the same bank?Each bank has its own policies, but having more than one checking account with the same bank is usually possible for qualifying customers. Check with your bank to learn about the process for opening a second checking account. While some allow you to open another account online and link it to your online banking, others may require you to contact them or open the account in person.What are some alternatives to checking accounts?If a checking account doesn\u2019t sound like the best fit for your personal finance goals, consider the following:Savings accounts: A savings account may be better if you\u2019d prefer to build an emergency fund, save for a specific goal, or seek a higher interest rate than a checking account provides. These accounts often have monthly withdrawal limits and typically don\u2019t come with account bonuses, debit cards, or checks.Money market accounts: Money market accounts have rates comparable to savings accounts but come with debit card access and checks. Monthly withdrawal limits may apply with a money market account.Prepaid debit cards: Prepaid debit cards are another alternative if you prefer not to open a new bank account and are accepted by most retailers. With a prepaid card, you can spend up to the full deposit amount added to the card. Once you\u2019ve spent your card\u2019s balance, you can reload it. Note: these cards typically have high fees.","Article Anthor":"Kat Tretina","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"10":{"Article Title":"How to find the best online checking account for September 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/best-online-checking-account-180614848.html","Article Content":"nazarkru via Getty ImagesThese days, you probably turn to the internet for news, entertainment, and shopping \u2026 so why not your checking account?Online checking accounts make it easier than ever to manage your money without ever having to step foot in a bank branch. Plus, they often come with lower fees and higher interest rates than traditional checking accounts. Here\u2019s what you should know if you\u2019re considering opening one.What is an online checking account?An online checking account is just that \u2014 a checking account that you can open and manage via the web without having to visit a local branch. These accounts are offered by traditional banks, credit unions, and online-only banks.You might be wondering why anyone would want a bank account that exists only online. After all, doesn\u2019t that make it harder to manage your money and keep it safe from hackers?Quite the opposite, actually. Online checking accounts come with several benefits:Access anywhere: You can view your balance, make deposits, pay bills, and more, as long as you have a computer and internet access.Bank from your phone: Many banks that offer online checking accounts also have a mobile app, allowing you to do all the above tasks from your phone or tablet too. Most allow for mobile check deposit, where you can deposit a check to your account by snapping a picture of it.Electronic transfers: Online checking accounts allow for electronic bill payment and transfers between accounts and even between different banks, eliminating the need for writing checks or visiting a physical location.ATM networks: Worried about how you\u2019ll pull out cash? You\u2019ll still need to visit an ATM for this task, but you aren\u2019t limited to your bank\u2019s locations. Most providers of online bank accounts are part of national ATM networks, such as Allpoint or Co-op. These allow checking account customers to use any ATM in the network without incurring a fee.Lower fees: Because online accounts don\u2019t come with the same administrative overhead costs as traditional accounts, those savings are often passed on to account holders in the form of lower (or no) fees. In some cases, the interest rates may be higher too.Safety: A common misconception about online banking is that it\u2019s not as safe as banking in person. However, an online checking account comes with the same \u2014 if not more \u2014 protections thanks to technology. Of course, it also requires some work on your part to keep your online banking information safe.Security measures and fraud protectionSpeaking of safety, it\u2019s important not to downplay the risks that come with managing your financial life online. However, the best online checking accounts should have robust security measures in place. And there are things you can personally do to keep your banking information out of the hands of identity thieves.For one, your bank's website and mobile apps should use strong encryption to protect your personal and financial information. Many banks also employ two-factor authentication, which requires you to verify your identity using two separate methods before you can access your account. For example, after entering your password, you might have to enter a code sent to your phone.Another security measure to look out for is automatic logout. If you're inactive on your online account or mobile app for a certain period, the bank should automatically log you out of your account. This helps to protect your information if you accidentally leave your device unattended.Many banks also offer customizable alerts for various account activities. You might set up alerts for things like large transactions, login attempts from unknown devices, or when your balance falls below a certain level. But even if you don\u2019t set up personalized alerts (though it\u2019s really a good idea), your financial institution should be regularly monitoring your accounts for unusual activity. If they notice anything suspicious, they may contact you to confirm the activity or block the transaction.Additionally, you can take these steps to enhance your security:Use a strong, unique password for your banking accounts.Regularly update your devices and banking apps to ensure you have the latest security patches.Be aware of phishing attempts and never click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited messages.Regularly review your account statements and transactions for any suspicious activity.Use secure networks when accessing your banking accounts online.Is an online checking account right for you?Despite the many benefits, an online account isn\u2019t for everyone. Before opening an online checking account, it\u2019s important to take stock of your biggest financial goals and priorities.For example, if you\u2019re looking for a high-yield checking account with no monthly fee and an expansive ATM network, an online account is probably a good choice. On the other hand, if you handle a lot of daily transactions and often need to visit your local bank branch to get assistance from a teller, an online checking account probably won\u2019t meet your needs.How to find the best online checking accountWhen it comes to opening an online checking account, the choices can seem overwhelming. There are more than 350 digital banks alone. Plus, many brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions offer online accounts. So how do you go about selecting the right one? Here are some important factors to consider:Fees and minimum balance requirementsThe fees associated with an online checking account are one of the most important factors to consider. Fees can hurt your bottom line and wipe out any interest earnings or rewards your account offers.For example, some financial institutions charge monthly maintenance fees. These fees are meant to cover the administrative costs of servicing your account. But they can often be waived by meeting certain requirements such as maintaining a minimum balance or signing up for direct deposit.It\u2019s also common for banks to charge a non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee if your account doesn\u2019t have enough money in it to cover a transaction. The average NSF fee currently stands at $34. However, some banks have committed to eliminating these fees, including Bank of America, Capital One, and Wells Fargo.You may also be charged fees for using out-of-network ATMs, receiving paper statements, and more. So before applying for an online checking account, be sure you understand all of the fees and how to avoid them or have them waived. Ideally, you will choose an account that doesn\u2019t charge these types of fees at all (yes, they exist).Interest ratesChecking account rates are generally lower than savings account rates. And the primary purpose of a checking account is to manage daily transactions, not grow long-term savings. That said, it can be nice to earn a little extra return on the money you have sitting in your account.Currently, the average checking account rate is just 0.07%. However, some high-yield online checking accounts offer rates of 1%-2% or more.ATM accessIf you use cash frequently, you\u2019ll definitely want to consider the bank's ATM network. For one, it\u2019s important that there are many ATMs available across the country in case you\u2019re traveling. Again, banks and credit unions that provide online checking accounts often belong to surcharge-free ATM networks that allow account holders to access their funds from many places, not just where the bank is located. Additionally, some online banks reimburse any fees incurred for using out-of-network ATMs.Digital banking toolsSince you're considering an online checking account, the bank's digital features will be even more important, including the usability of their mobile app and online banking platform. Find out if the account comes with features such as mobile check deposit, bill pay, money transfer options, real-time alerts, etc. \u2014 all of which will help you manage your account from home (or anywhere else).Customer service and reputationSince online banks don\u2019t have physical branches, look for a bank with strong customer service that can be reached through various channels, such as phone, email, live chat, and even social media. Check if they offer 24\/7 support, and through which channels.You\u2019ll also want to find out whether the bank is reputable in general. Sites such as the Better Business Bureau and Trust Pilot can give you an idea of what other customers\u2019 experiences have been. Comb through reviews and see if you notice any themes regarding account issues.You\u2019ll also want to double-check that the institution is insured. For banks, deposit insurance is provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). For credit unions, it\u2019s the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). These entities ensure your money is protected in case the institution fails, up to a limit of $250,000 per depositor.How to open and manage an online checking accountOnce you\u2019re ready to open a checking account online, the process is pretty straightforward.Start by gathering key documents. When filling out the application, you\u2019ll need to provide some documentation. That may include a copy of your driver\u2019s license, Social Security card, or passport to verify your identity. You may also need to provide proof of address in the form of a utility bill or bank statement. Having these items on hand before you get started will help streamline the process.Fill out an online application. This usually takes just a few minutes. Answer the questions in the application and upload any requested documents. Double-check that all your information is correct before submitting, as errors can delay the process.Fund your account. There may be a small minimum opening deposit required. The easiest way to fund the new account is by transferring the money from another account, but you may also be able to write a check.Set up online banking features and tools. Once your account is officially open, you can sign up for online banking, get any direct deposit in place, and activate your debit card.Monitor your account security. Your job isn\u2019t done once the account is open. Make sure you stay vigilant when it comes to protecting your account. Regularly check on your transaction activity, set up bank alerts, and periodically change your password.","Article Anthor":"Casey Bond","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"11":{"Article Title":"The best money market accounts for September 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/high-yield-money-market-accounts-170614474.html","Article Content":"Money market accounts (MMAs) are personal finance savings accounts, a hybrid of checking and savings accounts. You can often earn a higher interest rate than a savings account and get flexible access to your funds like a checking account.And yields are edging higher. As a result of the Federal Reserve's latest rate hike on July 26, interest rates are rising on bank deposit accounts. And the best high-yield money market accounts are showing some of their most impressive rates in years.Opening a money market account can help you work toward and accomplish your short-term savings goals, and finding a money market account with a high annual percentage yield (APY) can help you maximize your efforts.Types of money market accountsAs with savings accounts, there are two types of MMAs: traditional and high-yield accounts. Traditional money market accounts offer relatively low interest rates, albeit better than most traditional savings accounts on average.In contrast, high-yield money market accounts offer interest rates that are much higher than traditional money market accounts. That said, they may or may not offer higher APYs (percentage of growth earned through compound interest over one year) compared to some high-yield savings accounts.How do money market accounts work?Here's a breakdown of how money market savings accounts work, along with some of the most common account features:Interest: You can expect to earn interest on your balance, typically at a higher rate than traditional checking and savings accounts. That said, interest rates can vary depending on the financial institution and the type of money market account you choose. Also, some financial institutions may offer tiered rates based on your balance.Quick access to funds: Like a checking account, you can typically access your money using a debit card, an ATM card, logging into your account online, or via bank transfer. MMA accounts also often offer check-writing privileges. That said, account holders may be limited to six monthly withdrawals, a feature often shared with savings accounts. After that, your bank or credit union may charge an excessive withdrawal fee or even decline your requests.Fees: Like checking accounts, some money market accounts charge fees, including monthly fees and ATM fees, though thos fees may be waived if you meet certain criteria.Insurance: Like other deposit accounts, the funds in your money market account are typically federally insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). An NCUA- or FDIC-insured MMA will be covered up to $250,000.Balance requirements: Minimum balance requirements can vary, but in some cases, you may need to meet a certain minimum balance or initial deposit requirement to avoid a monthly fee or earn interest.Understanding yieldMoney market accounts offer interest on your deposits, either at a set rate regardless of your balance or on a tiered basis, with various rates based on your balance.But like other interest-bearing bank accounts, MMAs compound the interest you earn, typically daily, and pay it out monthly. Compounding interest increases your yield because interest accrues not only on your principal balance but also on the interest accumulated since the last time you were paid.For example, if you have a $10,000 balance in an account with a 4% interest rate, you'd earn roughly $1.10 in interest on Day 1. On Day 2, the bank or credit union will apply the same interest rate to a balance of $10,001.10 instead of $10,000.Because of compounding interest, the APY on your account will be higher than your interest rate. To calculate APY, you'll use the following formula:APY = (1+r\/n)n - 1In this equation, \"r\" is the account's annual interest rate in decimal form, and \"n\" is the number of compounding periods in a year.APY exampleLet's say you have a money market account that earns a 4% interest rate and compounds interest daily. To calculate the APY for the account, fill out the equation as follows (note that you'll likely need a calculator for the exponen)t:(1 + .04\/365)365 - 1(1 + 0.000109589041096)365 - 11.000109589041096365 - 11.0408084931325 - 10408084931325 or 4.08%While the APY typically isn't much higher than the interest rate, it can give you a more accurate idea of what you can expect to earn on your deposits.Factors affecting money market yieldsSeveral factors will impact how much you earn in a money market account. Here's what you can expect and how to compare account options:Interest rates: Money market account interest rates are variable and can change at any time based on market conditions \u2014 the highest APY available now may be lower or higher in the future, depending on the Fed. Additionally, with some financial institutions, your MMA rate may vary depending on how much money you have in the account.Balance: The account's interest rate will be applied to your balance, so as your balance grows, so will the amount of interest you earn. Keep in mind that some financial institutions require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest.Account fees: Some banks charge monthly maintenance fees on their money market accounts, which eat into your yield. In some cases, though, you may be able to get the fee waived if you maintain a certain balance. Many financial institutions also charge an excessive withdrawal fee if you withdraw money more than six times in a month.As you compare your money market account options, consider whether the accounts you're considering have a flat or tiered rate structure and how often interest compounds. You'll also want to look for minimum opening deposit and ongoing balance requirements.Finally, make sure you know what fees each account charges. If it's possible to waive the monthly service fee, determine whether you can meet the requirement to earn the waiver.How to find the best money market accountWhile it may be tempting to open a money market account with the bank you already have a relationship with, take your time to shop around and compare APYs from multiple sources to ensure you get the best offer available.For the most part, online banks offer the best money market account rates. But you can also find solid options with state and federal credit unions, and even some traditional banks.Run a quick search online for the best money market accounts, and several resources will pop up to help you compare the top options available.In addition to interest rates, fees, initial deposit amount needed, and balance requirements, check to see if you\u2019ll have easy access to your money market funds.Tips for maximizing money market yieldsDepending on your situation, you may be able to take advantage of different opportunities to make the most of your short-term savings. Here are just a few to consider:Automate your savings: Instead of saving money that's left over at the end of the month, incorporate your savings into your budget to ensure you're saving the amount you want each month.Choose the right account for your balance: If you have a sizable savings balance, you may earn a higher APY with a bank or credit union offering higher yields on larger deposits.Take advantage of promotional offers: It's not common for banks to offer promotional APYs on money market accounts, but still watch out for them as you shop around. Just make sure you read the fine print for the offer to understand how long the promotion lasts and the potential limitations.Minimize your fees: If you can find a money market account with a high APY and no monthly fee, you'll need to make sure you limit your withdrawals if there\u2019s a withdrawal limit in place. However, if the account you want charges a monthly fee, consider whether you can get that fee waived each month if you keep a higher minimum balance.Risks and considerationsWhile money market accounts can be a great place to stash short-term savings, there are some potential pitfalls to watch out for:Your earnings won't outpace inflation: While some of the highest-yielding money market accounts can beat out a high-yield savings account, they typically don't offer a high enough APY to compensate for inflation. As such, they're typically not the best option for long-term financial goals.Repeatedly exceeding your withdrawal limit could create greater consequences: You may not be concerned about an excessive withdrawal fee here and there. But if you exceed your monthly withdrawal limit regularly, your bank or credit union could decline your withdrawal requests or even close your account.Insurance coverage has limits: Like other bank accounts, money market accounts are safe and typically come with protection in the event that your bank or credit union fails. Both the FDIC and NCUA offer $250,000 in coverage per institution, per depositor, per ownership category. That should cover most people, but individuals with high net worths may need to spread out their funds across multiple institutions to maximize their protection.As you consider these potential risks, shop around and compare other types of banking products, including the best high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit, to determine which one best fits your personal finance goals.","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"12":{"Article Title":"How to find the best CD rates for September 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/find-best-cd-rates-165749654.html","Article Content":"Average CD interest rates have been trending upward at financial institutions nationwide.

You\u2019ll also learn about how the Federal Reserve affects CD rates, current CD rate trends, and the details you should consider when choosing a CD beyond the interest rate a bank or credit union offers you.How CDs workA certificate of deposit (CD) is a special type of interest-bearing account you can open by depositing a lump sum with a traditional bank, state or federal credit union, or online bank. Credit unions call CDs share certificates.A certificate of deposit usually has a fixed interest rate higher than other deposit accounts, such as savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts, and money market accounts. In exchange for this more competitive, fixed annual percentage yield (APY), you must agree to leave your cash in the account for a set period of time, called the CD\u2019s term.If you decide to withdraw your funds before the end of the CD term length, your bank will usually charge you an early withdrawal penalty. An early withdrawal penalty could offset some or all of the interest you earn on a CD. In some cases, you could even lose some of your initial deposit. Therefore, it\u2019s important to be strategic about your savings options and only lock up money in a CD that you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t need to access until the account matures.Pros and cons of a CD accountProsCD\u2019s are a great intro to personal finance tools. Unlike the stock market, CDs offer safe, reliable returns with no rate changes.CDs offer fixed interest rates with higher returns on average compared with other deposit accounts.When you open a CD at a federally insured bank or credit union, that CD is insured up to $250,000.Opening a CD may discourage you from tapping into your savings early.ConsYou'll typically pay an early withdrawal penalty if you need your cash before a CD\u2019s maturity date.The competitive rates on CDs \u2014 especially longer-term CDs \u2014 might not keep up with inflation.The minimum balance needed to open a CD may be too high.Although CDs are safer, they offer lower returns than mutual funds and stocks.Types of CDsIn addition to traditional certificates of deposit, there are several other types of CD to consider.Bump-up CDsWith a bump-up CD, you can request an increase in your APY if interest rates rise at your financial institution before your CD matures. Generally, it\u2019s a one-time-only request per term with a bump-up CD. Initial APYs on bump-up CDs are often lower.Step-up CDsStep-up CDs are similar to bump-up CDs. However, with a step-up CD, your financial institution will increase your APY at predetermined times.Callable CDsA callable CD gives the bank the right to terminate the CD before its maturity date. A callable CD might offer a higher APY than a traditional CD.No-penalty CDsA no-penalty CD allows you to take funds from your account before the maturity date without paying an early withdrawal penalty. No-penalty CD rates are usually lower than the APYs on traditional CDs.Bull CDsThe interest you earn on bull CDs is tied to a specific market index. If that market index rises, a bull CD will pay you a predetermined percentage in the form of interest. Most bull CDs also feature a guaranteed minimum rate of return.Bear CDsBear CDs are also tied to a specific market index, but the returns you may earn from a bear CD are based on shares of any market declines that occur.Jumbo CDsWith a jumbo CD, a bank requires a larger opening minimum deposit requirement \u2013 often $100,000 or more \u2013 than it would for a traditional CD. If you don\u2019t have quite enough to meet the minimum deposit, you could put the money you do have into a high-yield savings account or money market account to earn the interest you need to open a jumbo CD.Uninsured CDsUninsured CDs are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Uninsured CDs may offer a higher APY, but think carefully and consider seeking professional advice before you commit to a higher-risk account that isn\u2019t a member FDIC or NCUA. The FDIC and NCUA cover up to $250,000 per depositor and account category if your financial institution fails. You won\u2019t have that safety net with an uninsured CD.Variable-rate CDsWith regular CDs, you have a fixed rate through the entire CD term. When you open a variable-rate CD, the APY can fluctuate with market interest rates. If interest rates increase, you\u2019ll earn more on your savings. But if rates fall, your APY could drop.Zero coupon CDsZero coupon CDs don\u2019t pay interest during their term. Rather, you purchase the CD at a discount. When the CD matures at the end of its term, the bank pays you its full face value.How to save with CDsBelow are three common CD savings strategies to consider.CD ladderCD laddering is a savings strategy that involves opening multiple high-yield CDs with staggered maturity dates (i.e. a mix of shorter-term CDs and longer-term CDs). By spacing out the dates at which your CDs mature and then reinvesting your savings into longer-term CDs as your current ones come due, this methodology allows you to maintain access to a portion of your savings at periodic intervals while still earning higher returns than with a savings account.CD barbellA CD barbell involves dividing your savings between CDs with long-term and short-term accounts with no medium-term options.CD bulletA CD bullet is useful for saving toward a big financial goal. You open several CDs with similar maturity dates with the goal of having money from multiple CDs available at once.How to choose a CDWhen choosing a CD, consider the following factors:Rates: Banks and credit unions control their rates, so you\u2019ll find that the APYs on CDs can vary widely between financial institutions. Shop around to find the best rates.Rate type: When looking at your CD options, compare APYs and determine whether the CD has a fixed or variable APY.Term: CDs have different term lengths. Some are as short as one month; longer-term CDs can have terms as long as 10 years.Penalties or monthly fees: With a typical CD, you pay a penalty if you withdraw the funds from your CD early (before its maturity date). You could lose some or all of your earned interest, and even part of your principal in some cases. Additionally, check to see whether or not you\u2019ll be charged maintenance feesMinimum opening deposit: The minimum opening deposit for a CD will vary by bank or credit union, typically ranging from $500 to $5,000.CD rates todayThe average interest rate on a one-year CD is 1.72% as of August 2023, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. However, the top picks for the best CD rates far exceed the national average. Current CD rates are some of the highest CD rates in more than two decades. Combine falling inflation with U.S. banks starved for deposits, and the result: a nearly unmatched total return on cash. One-year CD yields are pushing past 5% and edging ever closer to a compelling 6% yield.The last time CDs paid high rates over 5.5% was in January 2001 \u2014 though they came close in the summer of 2007, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. When you shop around and compare rates from different banks, you can find one-year CD interest rates that are more than triple the national average.Shopping for the best CD rates by termThe term of your CD \u2014 the length of time it takes your CD to mature \u2014 can also affect the interest rate a bank offers you. In general, long-term CDs are thought to feature higher APYs as a benefit of letting the bank hold onto your cash for a longer period. But longer terms don\u2019t always equal higher interest rates with CD investing.In the current market, it\u2019s true that average interest rates increase between one-month and one-year CDs. Yet, at the moment, that upward interest rate trend isn't consistent with all longer-term CDs. Rates from the FDIC show two-year CDs have an APY of 1.47%, but a five-year CD sits at 1.37%, roughly 6.8% less than a two-year CD. As you can see, today's best CD rates aren\u2019t necessarily tied to accounts with the longest terms.Are CD rates going up?The federal funds rate is a target interest rate range that US banks charge one another to borrow excess reserves overnight. This rate influences both the interest rates that consumers pay when they borrow money and the rates that banks pay to their customers on deposit accounts like CDs, savings accounts, and others.In early May 2023, the Federal Reserve voted to raise the federal funds rate to 5.00%-5.25%. Then, in July 2023, the Fed again voted to raise federal funds, this time to 5.25%-5.50%.When the Fed increases the federal funds rate, rates on CDs and other banking products tend to increase too. So it would not be unusual to see further CD rate increases following this latest Federal Reserve rate hike. Meanwhile, some financial institutions, including online banks, raised their interest rates on some CD products in the aftermath of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank to try to hold on to more customers.The Fed has been raising rates over the past year to bring inflation under control. Inflation has moderated in recent months but remains above the Fed's target level of 2%. While no one can predict the future, more interest rate increases might be in store. If the Fed decides to raise interest rates again, bank CD rates could continue to increase.How to avoid missing outSavers may worry about locking their money into a CD and missing out on higher interest rates down the road. And in an environment where interest rates are rising, as they have been lately, missing out on a great rate is a real possibility.CD laddering and no-penalty CDs can help you avoid the risk of missing out on higher CD rates later. Here\u2019s a brief summary of these two options.No-penalty CDs: This type of CD gives you the option to withdraw funds from your account before the maturity date without paying a penalty. As a trade-off for this flexibility, however, banks tend to offer lower APYs for this type of account.CD ladder: With a CD ladder, you split your savings among multiple short-term CDs and longer-term CDs with staggered maturity dates (e.g., a 6-month CD, a 1-year CD, and a 2-year CD). When the first CD in your ladder matures, you can access those funds if you need them or roll the cash into a new CD \u2014 perhaps at a higher APY if one is available at that time. Of course, no one knows the future. So there\u2019s always a risk that APYs could start trending downward as well.Other details that matter when choosing a CDIf you\u2019re considering CD investing, search for the best possible APY. But that isn\u2019t the only detail that matters when it comes to choosing the right account.Here are some other things to consider when choosing a CD.Find the right term. Make sure you choose a CD term that fits your savings goals. That will lower the chance you'll need to pull money from the account before its term ends and trigger a penalty.Look for FDIC insurance. It\u2019s important to open a CD with a bank that\u2019s insured by the FDIC. If you\u2019re opening a share certificate, pick a state or federal credit union that\u2019s insured by the NCUA. Federal deposit insurance will cover you for up to $250,000 (per depositor, per account ownership category).Check the early withdrawal penalty. You should avoid taking your money out of a CD before it matures. Read the terms carefully so you know how much you\u2019d pay in an early withdrawal penalty if you have to access your cash prematurely.FAQsHow do I decide if a CD is right for me?CDs aren\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution for every financial situation. But they can be a solid, low-risk savings option if you\u2019re seeking higher returns than traditional savings accounts may offer.If you decide to incorporate CDs into your overall savings strategy, shopping around and comparing your options is important. There are many CDs to choose from; some banks offer higher interest rates than others. Once you choose the best CD for you, consider adding some of the strategies above to supercharge your savings and reach your savings goals even faster. However, if you think you may need immediate access to your cash on a regular basis, look at high-yield savings accounts along with checking accounts \u2014 those may be your best bet for now.What happens if I don\u2019t withdraw the funds after the CD\u2019s maturity date?When a CD matures, the bank or credit union will give you a grace period of several days after the maturity date passes. You'll need to decide whether to withdraw your funds from the CD or or roll it over into a new CD, ideally one with a higher APY if possible. In most cases, if you do not withdraw your funds and the grace period passes, your bank or credit union will automatically renew the CD.Are there other savings options available instead of CDs?Although CDs are increasingly popular, they aren\u2019t the only way to make your money grow. Depending on your financial situation and your goals, you may be better off with one of the following options:Traditional or online savings accountsHigh-yield savings accountsMoney market accountsWhile these savings accounts often have annual percentage yields that are a bit lower than traditional CDs offer, they all give you quick access to your money in an emergency. Accessing your savings easily can help prevent you from relying on credit cards or paying an early withdrawal penalty to access the funds tied up in a CD.Kat Tretina, Hal Bundrick, and Zina Kumok contributed to this article.","Article Anthor":"Michelle Lambright Black","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"13":{"Article Title":"The best CD rates for September 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/the-best-cd-rates-155911888.html","Article Content":"Fahmi Ruddin Hidayat via Getty ImagesCD rates haven\u2019t been this high in years.

You should also consider term length and early withdrawal penalties in case a financial emergency comes up.Look for a bank, credit union, or neobank that offers a CD that works for you, and then evaluate other factors such as branch locations, a robust online banking app, plentiful customer service options, and easy-to-follow instructions for opening and closing a CD.The term of a CD affects the amount of interest \u2014 or annual percentage yield \u2014 you'll be offered.

In the current market, average interest rates increase between 1-month and 1-year CDs.What is a CD?A certificate of deposit, called a CD for short, is a type of savings account you can incorporate into your personal finance savings strategy. You can open a bank CD by depositing a lump sum with a traditional or online bank.

If you decide to withdraw funds from a CD before its maturity date, your bank may charge you a penalty for accessing your money early. An early withdrawal penalty could offset some or all of the interest you earn on a CD. In some cases, you could even lose part of your initial deposit.Picking the right CD could come down to finding the highest APY for the term you\u2019re seeking.

Learn about types of life insurance policies and how to get coverage. (Yurii Karvatskyi via Getty Images)Life insurance is a contract between an insurance company and a policyholder where the insurer agrees to pay a lump sum of money if the insured person dies during a covered period in exchange for premium payments. If you have people who depend on you financially, you probably need life insurance.In this article, we\u2019ll cover the types of life insurance policies, the benefits of life insurance and how to get coverage. But first, to understand how life insurance works, you need to understand a few key terms.Life insurance policy: The agreement between the insurance company and the policyholder to insure someone\u2019s life.Policyholder or policy owner: The person who owns the life insurance policy. Typically, this is the person whose life is insured.Death benefit: The sum of money the insurer pays out when the covered person dies.Beneficiary: The individual who receives the death benefit payout when the insured person passes. You can have a single beneficiary or multiple beneficiaries.Premiums: The monthly or annual payments the policyholder pays to keep the policy in force.Policy riders: Optional add-ons to a life insurance policy that are available for an extra cost.Types of life insurance policiesThere are two basic types of life insurance policies: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. The key difference is that term insurance only covers you for a specified period of time, whereas permanent life insurance covers you for your entire life. Also, permanent life insurance policies have a savings component called cash value, whereas term policies don\u2019t.Term life insuranceA term life policy pays a death benefit only if you die within a certain period, i.e., 20 years or 30 years. If you don\u2019t die during the term, the policy expires without paying out money. Term life insurance policies don\u2019t accumulate cash value. However, premiums are much cheaper than permanent life insurance premiums.Whole life insuranceWhole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance. Also referred to as ordinary life insurance, these policies offer a guaranteed death benefit, plus cash value that grows at a rate guaranteed by your insurer. If you choose what\u2019s called a participating policy, the insurer may also pay dividends. For all these benefits, you\u2019ll pay a higher premium.Universal life insuranceUniversal life insurance is a type of permanent coverage that\u2019s more flexible than whole life coverage. You can adjust the premiums (within limits) and your death benefit as your financial situation and needs change. The insurer guarantees a minimum cash value growth, but the interest you earn will vary based on money market rates.Variable life insuranceLike universal life insurance, variable life insurance offers flexible premium payments and death benefits, but you\u2019re allowed to invest the policy\u2019s cash value in underlying sub-accounts similar to mutual funds. Because the cash value is linked to financial market performance, variable life policies are riskier than other life insurance options.How life insurance worksWhen you apply for a policy, the life insurance company will review your medical records and often require a physical exam to determine how risky of an applicant you are. Essentially, they\u2019re assessing the likelihood that you\u2019ll die during the covered period. The underwriting process determines how much coverage you qualify for and how much you\u2019ll pay.You\u2019ll pay your premiums at regular intervals, i.e., monthly, quarterly or annually. If you miss premium payments, your policy could eventually lapse. Your premiums go toward:Insurer expenses: The portion that goes toward the insurer\u2019s business expenses and profits.Cost of insurance: The amount that\u2019s used to pay for death benefits.Cash value: If you have permanent life insurance (but not term insurance), part of your premium goes toward the cash value component. You can use the cash value to make partial withdrawals, take a policy loan, pay your premiums or withdraw it all and surrender the policy.Regardless of what type of policy you have, the death benefit is generally income tax-free for your beneficiaries. If you have permanent life insurance, your cash value grows on a tax-deferred basis as long as the policy is in force. You can take tax-free loans or withdrawals against the policy if the amount you take out isn\u2019t more than your cost basis, i.e., what you paid in premiums.Purpose and benefits of life insuranceThe most important reason you\u2019d want to buy life insurance is to avoid putting a financial burden on your loved ones when you die. Beyond that peace of mind, some specific reasons for buying life insurance include:Paying for final expenses. The median cost of a funeral with a viewing and burial was $7,848 in 2021, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Life insurance \u2014 and specifically burial insurance \u2014 can help your loved ones pay for these costs and other final expenses.Income replacement. Buying life insurance can help replace your income if you die, allowing those who financially depend on you to maintain their standard of living. Some people also opt for a death benefit that would cover the cost of their children\u2019s education and\/or college tuition.Paying off a mortgage or other debt. Obtaining a policy with a large enough benefit to pay off your mortgage and any other debt provides financial protection for your partner or spouse. If you have debt that someone else cosigned for, you might consider buying life insurance for at least that amount so they won\u2019t be stuck paying it off if you die.Providing a tax-advantaged supplement to retirement savings. Buying cash value life insurance can provide a tax-deferred way to save for retirement, particularly if you\u2019re already maxing out tax-deferred accounts, like a 401(k) and individual retirement account (IRA).Leave a legacy. Choosing permanent life insurance can allow you to leave a guaranteed inheritance to your loved ones or make a substantial gift to charity.Pay for estate taxes. With the federal estate tax exemption at $12.92 million in 2023, most people don\u2019t need to worry about estate taxes. But some high-net-worth people use life insurance as an estate-planning tool to cover the tax bill.Determining your coverage amountThere\u2019s no one-size-fits all method to determine how much life insurance coverage is sufficient, but there are a few common formulas that can help you gauge your needs. Keep in mind that these are rough estimates. Consider working with a financial professional to determine the amount of life insurance coverage and the best life insurance policy type for your unique situation.Multiple of incomeDetermine how many years you\u2019d want to replace your income for, then multiply your salary by that number. If you earn $50,000 a year and want to replace your income for 20 years, you need a $1 million death benefit.Younger people will usually want to choose a higher multiple than older individuals because they have more potential future earnings. Someone who\u2019s 35 may want to replace 30 years of income, while replacing 10 years of income may suffice for a 60-year-old.10 times your income plus college costsIn this formula, you multiply your income by 10, then add in the costs of higher education for your children. Many experts recommend estimating college costs at $100,000 to $150,000 per child.DIME formulaWith the DIME formula, you add up the following amounts to estimate how much life insurance you need:Debt: Your total non-mortgage debtIncome: The amount of income you want to replaceMortgage: The amount you need to pay off your mortgage in fullEducation: The expected costs of your children\u2019s educationEssentially, you\u2019d use the multiple of income formula, then add in your total debt (including your mortgage payoff amount) and education costs to arrive at a benefit amount.Pro tip: Even if no one relies on your income, you might still need life insurance. For example, stay-at-home parents of young children should consider buying a policy.Life insurance processThe first step in the life insurance process is to decide what type of insurance you want, along with how much coverage you\u2019re seeking. Then, you can obtain a quote online or through a life insurance agent. To get an accurate life insurance quote, you\u2019ll usually need to provide some basic information like your date of birth, gender, height and weight, tobacco usage, and whether you take blood pressure or cholesterol medication.Once you\u2019ve chosen the policy you want, you\u2019ll need to complete the application. The typical underwriting process involves a detailed health questionnaire and a medical exam. The insurer may also ask you to get what\u2019s called an attending physician statement from your doctor if they need more context about any health issues.After your application is approved, you\u2019ll need to review the policy documents and sign the contract. Coverage will begin shortly after you make your first premium. To avoid a lapse in coverage, you\u2019ll need to continue paying the premiums.Pro tip: Some policies, known as guaranteed issue policies, approve nearly all applicants without requiring health information. But these policies have low death benefits, often $25,000 or less.Conclusion: Do you need life insurance?Not everyone needs life insurance. If you don\u2019t have dependents and you have enough savings to pay for final expenses, you may not need coverage. However, if you hope to have a family someday, buying coverage while you\u2019re young can help you lock in an affordable insurance rate.To determine whether you need life insurance, consider whether anyone would be financially burdened if you die. If the answer is yes, life insurance is probably well worth the cost.No one likes to think about dying.

Shopping around for the best premiums, bundling coverage, working to improve your credit and maximizing discounts are a few ways to save money.Insurance companies are competing for your business, and you can use this to your advantage. Below are tips on how to shop for cheap car insurance, along with ways to get lower car insurance rates with your existing insurer. You\u2019ll also learn the factors that impact your insurance premiums and other cost-saving measures.Assessing your coverage needsBefore you start shopping, take a fresh look at how much car insurance you need. From there, you can compare that to your current coverage and see how the two align.Are you paying for more coverage than you need? Or are you underinsured to the point where you might be financially vulnerable in the event of an accident?As a policyholder, it\u2019s important to have a clear understanding of the different types of auto insurance and the amount of each type of coverage you\u2019ll need for your situation. Here are some common insurance options:Liability: Required in nearly every state, liability insurance covers property damage and bodily injury for other drivers and passengers for accidents you cause.Collision: Collision coverage can help you pay to repair or replace your personal vehicle if you\u2019re in an accident.Comprehensive: Comprehensive coverage can help protect you if your vehicle is damaged in ways that don\u2019t involve a collision. Theft, vandalism, and storm damage are examples of potential losses that comprehensive insurance may cover.Personal injury protection, or PIP: PIP may help provide financial coverage for your medical bills (along with your passenger\u2019s medical bills) in the event of an accident.Full coverage: Full coverage is an unofficial term for a car insurance policy that includes liability insurance, collision, comprehensive, and sometimes more.You can also examine your deductible amounts and determine whether adjusting them may be in order. (Later, when you shop around and get quotes from other insurers, these details will empower you to make sure you\u2019re comparing apples to apples rather than getting prices for different products and different levels of coverage.)Adjusting the types and amount of coverage you purchase can lower your car insurance costs overall. But less coverage can also leave you more exposed in the event of an accident. It\u2019s important to find a middle ground as you try to cut costs to ensure you maintain the right level of protection.Tips for finding cheap car insuranceObtaining affordable car insurance isn\u2019t a single step. You\u2019ll probably need to combine several strategies to get the best car insurance rates possible. Here are five tips.1. Shop around and compare quotes from multiple insurers.Each insurer has its own methodology for setting premiums, using factors including your driving history, make, model and age of covered car(s), marks on your driving record such as moving violations and any other motorists who will be covered (hint: teen drivers are more expensive). Shopping around for quotes from multiple providers has the potential to reduce your auto insurance rates in a meaningful way.You might get quotes for comparable policies with annual premiums that are hundreds of dollars apart. In addition to locking in an affordable rate, you want coverage with the best car insurance company for the money, meaning one with a history of doing business in your state and a record of covering claims in a timely and fair way.2. Use online comparison tools and insurance websites.As you\u2019re searching for quotes from different auto insurance companies, online comparison tools can make the shopping process easier. Some insurance websites will also provide you with quotes from competitors alongside their own rates so you can see how the premiums measure up.Online insurance comparison tools can save you time by eliminating the need to input your personal details over and over again. Plus, as you select the coverage options you desire, these tools can make sure you\u2019re comparing quotes for similar policies.3. Consider direct insurers, independent agents and captive agents.There are three main avenues for buying car insurance \u2014 direct insurers, independent agents and captive agents. Here\u2019s what those terms mean:Direct insurers: With direct insurers, you typically buy your insurance straight from the company\u2019s website or app. There\u2019s no intermediary between you and the insurance provider (and no separate agent to offer you personalized advice or answers either). Examples include Geico, Esurance and Progressive.Captive agents: Captive insurance agents only sell the products their company offers and cannot provide you with quotes from competitors. Examples in the auto insurance space include Farmers, Nationwide, State Farm, and Farm Bureau.Independent agents: Independent insurance agents work with numerous providers. As a result, they can sell products from multiple insurance companies and help you shop around for the cheapest rates and hidden discounts. Yet it\u2019s still important to check rates on your own since insurance agents often get paid on commission and may have financial motivation to sell you certain policies over others.4. Explore discounts and incentives offered by insurance carriers.Searching for car insurance discounts that different providers offer can be another great way to save on your premiums. There are many different discount options and incentives available. Below are some of the most common.Bundling discounts, also known as multi-policy discounts. You\u2019re often rewarded with better rates when you purchase multiple policies, such as auto, life, homeowners or renters insurance, from one company.Low mileage discountsDefensive driving course discountsSafe driver discounts for maintaining good driving habitsGood student discounts for young drivers who earn good gradesMilitary discountsLoyalty discounts for staying with a company for several yearsAutopay discountsSecurity discount for installing an anti-theft devicePaid-in-full insurance premium discounts for paying your premium six months or a year at a time instead of monthlyPaperless statement discount5. Beware of potential discount insurance pitfalls.Everyone loves to save money. But certain types of discount insurance can come with pitfalls that you\u2019re better off avoiding.For example, some discounted or cheap insurance policies may not cover permissive drivers (aka someone you gave permission to use your vehicle) or they might provide only reduced coverage. With other policies, your coverage level might drop when you drive outside of your state of residence.It\u2019s important to read the fine print of your auto policy to understand any coverage restrictions. And check out the online reviews and complaints for different insurers you\u2019re considering.Strategies to save money with your current insurerIf you don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of changing auto insurance providers, you might be able to save money on your current policy.Ask for discounts: Watching your premiums increase for the same coverage gets old fast. Call your insurance agent or insurance company and ask if you\u2019re eligible for any of those discounts listed above. If you\u2019re considering changing insurers or you\u2019ve found a lower rate with a competitor, mention that.Increase your deductibles: If you have a solid emergency fund, setting a higher deductible could lower your car insurance premiums. In return, however, you\u2019d have to pay more out of pocket for accident repairs before your coverage kicks in.Adjust coverage amounts: If you have an older vehicle that\u2019s paid in full, you might consider reducing your coverage or even switching to liability only. But you should go this route only if you\u2019re financially able to fix your own vehicle in an accident.Factors that affect car insurance ratesWhile premiums vary among insurers, there are some common factors that affect the car insurance quotes you receive from different providers, including the following.Vehicle make and model: Certain types of cars cost more money than others to insure. As a rule, new cars and more expensive cars have higher repair costs, which will lead to higher insurance rates. If you\u2019re considering buying a new or used vehicle, it\u2019s wise to research the cost of insurance before you make your purchase.Age: Younger drivers typically pay more for auto insurance due to a lack of experience behind the wheel.Coverage selections and limits: The types of insurance you choose and your coverage limits have a significant impact on your car insurance rates.Credit score: Your credit-based insurance score helps predict how likely you are to file an insurance claim. Good credit has the potential to save you money on your premiums, although some states limit or don\u2019t allow insurance providers to use credit when pricing auto insurance policies.Driving record: A clean driving record should save you money on your car insurance. On the other hand, if you have a history of speeding tickets, DUIs, at-fault accidents or other black marks, you should expect to pay higher premiums.Saving money by switching car insurance companiesAccording to J.D. Power, close to one-third (31%) of auto insurance customers in the U.S. have experienced a rate increase in the past year. During that same time period, auto insurance premiums have gone up an average of 15.5% to compensate for the record-high losses that insurers have experienced.Some insurers offer loyalty discounts to discourage customers from changing providers. However, it\u2019s still wise to review offers from competitors at least once every 12 months to confirm you\u2019re getting the best AND cheapest car insurance coverage.","Article Anthor":"Michelle Lambright Black","Article Date":"Mon, Oct 2, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"16":{"Article Title":"Understanding guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers \u2014 and what to know before becoming one","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/guarantor-cosigner-vs-coborrower-172936653.html","Article Content":"Financing a large purchase with a personal loan can be a great way to build wealth without dinging your budget upfront. The catch? Most lenders rely heavily on your credit history to tell them if you\u2019re a trustworthy borrower.In these cases, if your credit score needs some TLC, you might need someone to vouch for you who has good credit so your lender will feel more comfortable doing business with you.Guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers explainedIf you\u2019re contemplating applying for a new personal loan, understanding your credit score and how your lender might view it is key.Your credit score gives your lender a better understanding of your financial habits regarding credit usage and repayment. The major credit bureaus take factors like your payment history, length of credit history, amount owed, credit mix, and new credit into account when calculating your final score.You might need some backup if your credit isn\u2019t up to your lender\u2019s standards.What is a guarantor?A guarantor is someone who guarantees a loan like a mortgage, student loan, or auto loan \u2014 meaning that they agree to repay that loan if the borrower fails to make monthly payments on their loan.Essentially, a guarantor\u2019s job is to reassure your lender that they will be repaid. And if the borrower fails to make a loan payment, they\u2019ll make those payments on the borrower\u2019s behalf. In many cases, a borrower might lean on a guarantor if they have a bad credit score, no credit history, or earn a lower income.Anyone over age 21 can be a guarantor with a healthy credit history. Usually, a guarantor is someone the borrower has a close relationship with like a parent, sibling, or close friend.What is a co-signer?A co-signer is like a guarantor, with the main difference being that a co-signer is liable for a borrower\u2019s debt from day one, while a guarantor is only liable once the borrower fails to make payments.Being a co-signer for a friend or loved one can help increase their chances of loan approval, but it does imply a significant risk if they don\u2019t hold up their end of the bargain. Failure to repay their loan could significantly damage your credit score and hurt your chances of qualifying for a new loan or credit card in the future.What is a co-borrower?A co-borrower is a co-applicant, who shares equal responsibility for the loan along with the borrower or borrowers involved.Having a co-borrower can make a lot of sense if you both stand to benefit from the asset that\u2019s being financed. Say you\u2019re hoping to open a business, you might consider applying for a loan with your business partner who will also profit from the revenue your business earns.The upside of having a co-borrower is having someone to share the debt burden and repayment with. What\u2019s more \u2014 if your co-borrower has a higher credit score or lower debt-to-income ratio (DTI), you may be able to qualify for a larger loan or one with more favorable terms.What to consider before agreeing to be someone\u2019s guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrowerBefore you agree to be someone\u2019s guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower, there are several factors you should carefully consider to determine if it\u2019s the right move for you.The state of your personal financesSharing any portion of someone\u2019s debt or repayment is a huge responsibility. If your personal finances aren\u2019t in tip-top shape, you could risk damaging your credit score and hindering your chances of borrowing in the future.Consider how much debt you currently have, if any, and whether or not you\u2019d be able to fit an additional debt payment into your budget if the borrower fails to make payments.The terms and conditions of the loanBefore you sign on the dotted line, you should be clear on the terms and conditions of your loan. Have a candid conversation with the primary or co-borrower to understand what the loan is for, the total loan amount borrowed, interest rates associated with the loan, and the repayment schedule and timeline.You should also ask clear questions about your legal responsibility and understand in which scenarios you\u2019d be responsible for making payments and when.Your relationship with the borrowerUltimately, taking any level of ownership of someone else\u2019s debt is an act of trust, so you should only do so if you have full and complete trust that they will manage their debt responsibly and make on-time payments.It\u2019s also important to consider how sharing this debt will affect your relationship should they default on their loan.Be sure to discuss a clear loan repayment plan and explore all possible outcomes to determine whether or not you feel comfortable taking on this new responsibility.Your near-term financial goalsServing as someone\u2019s guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrower may impact your ability to hit some of your own financial goals. It\u2019ll increase your DTI and could make qualifying for a new loan more difficult in the future.If your financial plans include buying a home, taking out a student loan to go back to school, financing a vehicle, or other financial milestones that require the help of a lender, it may not be the time to involve yourself in someone else\u2019s debt. This move will be reflected on your credit report and too many new credit applications in a short time could lead to a rejection and a drop in your credit score.It can certainly be rewarding to help a loved one achieve their goals, but understanding the pros and cons can help you make a more informed decision.FAQs about being a guarantor, co-signer, or co-borrowerCan a family member be a co-borrower?Yes. Anyone who meets the eligibility requirements set by your lender can be a co-borrower. This includes parents, siblings, a spouse, a business partner, friends, and more.Is a co-borrower also a co-owner?Not always. A co-borrower shares financial responsibility for an asset, but may not always share ownership of the asset. Depending on your arrangement, the type of loan, and the ownership agreement in place, a co-borrower may also be a co-owner, but this isn\u2019t always the case.What happens if I am a guarantor on someone\u2019s loan and they stop making payments?If the primary borrower fails to make a payment on their loan, their lender will take steps to contact them and remind them about their missed payment. After a series of missed payments, the loan will enter into default, at which time the lender may contact you (the guarantor) to collect missed payments and get the loan back into good standing. If both you and the borrower fail to make payments on the loan, the lender could take legal action as a result and you\u2019ll likely see a decrease in your credit score.Are guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers legally protected if the primary borrower defaults on their loan?In most cases, guarantors and co-signers have limited legal protections if a borrower defaults on their loan. Lenders outline the terms of the loan agreement and guarantors, co-signers, and co-borrowers are legally responsible for the loan amount. Before signing any loan agreement, it may be worth your while to speak with a legal expert who can help you understand the terms of your agreement.Can you remove a guarantor from your loan?Over time, you may be able to remove a guarantor from your loan if you can prove to your lender that you\u2019ll be able to make payments on your loan without their support. You may need to refinance your loan by applying for a new loan on your own and, if approved, using those loan funds to repay your existing loan \u2014 thus, freeing your guarantor from their obligation.You may even be able to secure a lower interest rate on your loan, depending on your credit and income.","Article Anthor":"Ivana Pino","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 29, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"17":{"Article Title":"Here\u2019s how a DUI impacts your car insurance","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/car-insurance-after-dui-163728985.html","Article Content":"nurlankani via Getty ImagesDrivers in nearly every state are required to obtain minimum car insurance coverage, including those with past violations for driving under the influence (DUI), driving while intoxicated (DWI), or operating under the influence (OUI). But with these charges on your record, car insurance companies will generally view you as a higher risk to insure, which can mean unexpected policy cancellations and increased insurance rates.Despite this, you\u2019ll still need coverage to meet your state\u2019s insurance requirements.Here\u2019s what to know about car insurance after a DUI, how your rates will change, and tips for lowering your insurance costs.What happens after a DUI?If you're pulled over and arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, the arresting officer will probably confiscate your driver's license. You may receive a temporary license once you're released from custody, which you can use until you're arraigned in court.Whether you want to hire a lawyer for your court hearing depends on your individual preferences and driving history. For instance, it may be wise to hire a lawyer if you have a past DUI or to help you resolve the case on a reduced charge.If you\u2019re found guilty of driving under the influence, your license will likely be revoked for at least 90 days, though it could be longer depending on your state\u2019s rules and if it\u2019s your first offense. Your DUI conviction will also appear on your driving record, and your auto insurance company might drop your coverage.If not, expect a rate hike.How a DUI impacts your car insurance ratesIf your insurance company allows you to maintain your policy after a DUI or DWI conviction, you can expect a sharp increase in your auto insurance rates. A 2023 study from auto insurance comparison site QwoteWizard estimates that car insurance premiums increase by an average of $1,495 annually, or $124 monthly, after a DUI. The study is based on data from Quadrant Information Services, which collects rate and pricing data from insurance providers nationwide.But the amount your rate increases can vary by state. According to the QwoteWizard study, drivers in Hawaii, California, and North Carolina saw the biggest increases after a DUI. For instance, California drivers paid an average of $157 per month with a clean record and around $433 monthly after a DUI.If you have other infractions besides a DUI, such as an at-fault accident or speeding ticket, these will also result in higher car insurance costs. Depending on your state and driving history, your DUI may remain on your record for three to 10 years, while other infractions typically remain for up to five years or longer in states like Minnesota and Hawaii.While insurance companies often hike rates for a minimum of three years after a driving infraction, the amount of time your rates will remain high varies based on your insurer, driving record, and infraction you\u2019ve committed.SR-22 and FR-44 requirementsCertain states, such as California and Washington, will require that your insurer files an SR-22 form with the state to prove you consistently meet minimum coverage requirements after a DUI. In Virginia and Florida, you\u2019ll need to file an FR-44 instead of an SR-22 if you have a DUI conviction. Some states, like New York, don\u2019t require you to file an SR-22 or FR-44, though you can still expect higher insurance rates for serious driving violations.Typically, an FR-44 or SR-22 filing will need to be in place for at least three years following a DUI conviction, though requirements vary by state. Once you\u2019ve met your state\u2019s requirements, you can request that your insurance company remove the form from your record.How to get coverage after a DUIMaintaining adequate insurance will be fairly simple \u2014 though expensive \u2014 if your insurance provider offers policies for drivers with past DUIs. You can request that your insurer file any required forms with your state. But expect your regular monthly car insurance premiums to increase due to the conviction.Things get a little more complicated if your insurer cancels your policy because of a DUI conviction. You'll need to find a provider willing to issue car insurance policies to high-risk drivers \u2014 and you\u2019ll need to do so quickly to avoid a lapse in coverage, which could result in even higher rates. It can be helpful to contact your state's department or bureau of motor vehicles for guidance on obtaining DUI car insurance.Remember that most states require at least a minimum amount of car insurance coverage, often including two types of liability insurance. Note that insurance requirements can vary by state.Bodily injury liability: Covers medical costs for individuals in other vehicles if you\u2019re at fault in a car accident.Property damage liability: Pays for repairs to damaged property if you're found responsible for an accident.If your car is leased or financed, your lender may require you to obtain more coverage. Here are some other coverage options.Comprehensive coverage: Pays for car repairs if your vehicle is damaged due to a covered event, such as severe weather, a fire, burglary, or another event outside your control.Collision coverage: Pays for car repairs if your vehicle is damaged in an accident with another car.Underinsured\/uninsured motorist: Protects you if you\u2019re in a crash with another driver who doesn\u2019t have adequate car insurance coverage.Personal injury protection: Also called no-fault insurance, personal injury protection (PIP) covers your healthcare expenses if you\u2019re injured in an accident, no matter who\u2019s responsible.Tips for finding cheap car insurance for high-risk driversOnce you have a list of potential insurers that issue policies to high-risk drivers and you understand your insurance requirements and needs, it\u2019s time to find coverage. While your cost of car insurance will be higher with a DUI, rates vary across companies. Here are some tips for finding relatively affordable coverage.1. Use rate comparison toolsOnline insurance calculators and rate comparison tools let you view quotes from multiple insurance companies in one place. These tools can help save you time as you shop for a new policy as a high-risk driver.2. Get multiple quotesIf you prefer to seek out car insurance quotes on your own, you can also go that route. Many major insurers, including Progressive, State Farm, GEICO, Allstate, USAA, The General and Erie all write high-risk policies. You can start an application online or speak with insurance agents to obtain quotes and compare rates.3. Seek out discountsMany insurers offer discounts, which may be accessible despite your DUI. For instance, bundling multiple policies like your homeowners and auto insurance with the same provider could help you save on your premiums. Other common ones include safe vehicle, good grades, low-mileage discounts and good driver discounts. Yahoo Personal FinanceHow to minimize the long-term impact of a DUI on insurance ratesA DUI conviction will generally stay on your driving record for five to 10 years, though the time frame depends on your state. But there are things you can do to reduce the time you must face rate increases.1. Maintain a clean driving recordMaintaining a squeaky-clean driving record is the best thing you can do to help reduce your rates over time.2. Take a defensive driving courseMany insurance companies offer safe driving discounts if you complete a defensive driving course.3. Improve your credit scoreYour credit history is sometimes used as a factor in setting individual insurance rates. The lowest rates are often reserved for individuals with excellent credit or good credit because they\u2019re deemed as less risky to insure. Note that some states prohibit the use of credit as a rating factor.4. Shop around for new coverageIf your DUI is a few years in the past, it\u2019s possible a new insurer may offer you better rates. Shopping around every year is worth it to see if you can get cheaper car insurance.","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 28, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"18":{"Article Title":"What happens if someone else crashes your car?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/what-happens-if-someone-else-crashes-your-car-143402884.html","Article Content":"nurlankani via Getty ImagesThere are many situations when letting someone borrow your car makes sense. Your sister\u2019s car is in the shop. You have too many margaritas at happy hour and ask your sober friend to drive home. Your neighbor asks if he can run a quick errand.But what happens if they get into a wreck in your car? Or you\u2019re borrowing a car and have an accident? Does the driver\u2019s insurance kick in or does the burden fall on the car owner\u2019s coverage? And can you get in trouble for borrowing a car and then getting into an accident?Here\u2019s a look at what happens if you or someone else crashes a borrowed car, and how to ensure you\u2019re always financially protected behind the wheel of someone else\u2019s vehicle.What happens if someone else crashes your car?Letting someone borrow your car can be nerve-wracking. Not only are you letting the driver take your high-value item around town, your car insurance policy comes into play too. Under the concept of \u201cpermissive use,\u201d if you give permission for a valid driver to borrow your vehicle, your policy still covers your car.But there are some key nuances.If someone else drives and wrecks your car, but they are not at fault, the other driver\u2019s liability coverage will cover the property damage and bodily injury. If the at-fault driver doesn\u2019t have enough coverage, your policy\u2019s uninsured\/underinsured motorist protection may be necessary to cover the difference.If you lend your car to someone who is at-fault in an accident, though, your own auto insurance coverage will apply. Any resulting property damage or injuries will be covered by your insurance company, up to your policy\u2019s coverage limits.It\u2019s important to read the fine print of your policy documents, to ensure that you understand your carrier\u2019s permissive use policies and exactly what they cover.Who pays the deductible?If you have collision coverage on your vehicle, in the event a friend or family member wrecks your car, it will pay to repair or replace your vehicle. If you\u2019re the at-fault party, you will still be responsible for paying any applicable deductible for the repairs, though.So, who actually pays the deductible, if you weren\u2019t technically driving your car in the first place? Well, this is where things get a bit gray.In most cases, you and your friend will need to talk to decide who pays. If your friend refuses, or can\u2019t afford the deductible, you may have to foot the bill in order to get your car repaired. Your carrier may choose to go after your friend\u2019s auto insurance policy for costs that exceed your policy limits, but they don\u2019t typically recover your deductible for you.Read more: What you need to know about car insurance deductiblesWhat if you don\u2019t have enough coverage?If your liability from an at-fault accident exceeds your policy limits \u2014 even if a friend was driving \u2014 you may find yourself in a sticky situation.First, the borrower\u2019s own insurance coverage may be tapped to provide secondary coverage, depending on your state and the specifics of the accident. If you have an umbrella policy or other personal liability policy, that coverage may also be utilized to cover the not-at-fault driver\u2019s damages.If your coverage still isn\u2019t enough, you could be personally liable for the expenses beyond your policy limits.Will your insurance cover someone not on your policy?If you let a loved one borrow your car and that person gets into an accident, your carrier will usually cover the loss even if that individual wasn\u2019t on your policy. There are a few exceptions, though:If there wasn\u2019t permissive use: Your carrier may deny insurance claims for a car accident if someone borrowed your vehicle without your explicit permission, i.e., non-permissive use.If the driver wasn\u2019t legally licensed or was impaired: As the owner of the vehicle, it\u2019s your responsibility not to lend it to someone without a valid driver\u2019s license, whose license is suspended, or someone who is obviously impaired. If you do lend your vehicle to a reckless or illegal driver, your carrier may deny a resulting claim. So it may seem obvious, but you should think twice about handing your keys to anyone with a history of speeding tickets, drunk driving, DUIs or other black marks on their driving record.If the driver was listed as a named exclusion \u2014 You can list people on your policy as excluded drivers, meaning you are explicitly excluding them from your coverage. If an excluded driver uses your vehicle and gets in an accident, your carrier will not extend coverage.If someone will be borrowing your vehicle regularly, you may want to add them as an authorized driver to your policy. This will ensure that they are always protected when using your car, and you never have to worry about whether or not coverage is provided.What happens if you wreck a borrowed car?In general, car insurance follows the car, not the driver. So, as long as you borrowed a car that has active and valid insurance coverage, you should be protected if you get in an accident. In most situations, primary coverage would be the policy of the car owner, not the driver.If you\u2019re at fault for wrecking a borrowed car, the vehicle owner\u2019s insurance should provide liability coverage to the not-at-fault driver and also pay to fix the borrowed vehicle if collision insurance was added.If you aren\u2019t at fault for a wreck in a borrowed vehicle, the at-fault driver\u2019s liability coverage should cover your injuries and any damage to the car you were driving.When would your own insurance company have to pay?If you get into an auto accident in a borrowed car, there is a chance that your own auto insurance policy may be required to provide secondary coverage if you\u2019re found at-fault.This typically only occurs if the vehicle owner doesn\u2019t have sufficient coverage. In this case, your own coverage may be called on to cover damages that exceed the owner\u2019s policy limits.If you\u2019re injured in the accident, your policy can also provide you with personal injury protection (PIP) and medical payments (Medpay) coverage in some cases, even if you\u2019re driving a borrowed car. Yahoo Personal FinanceHow often do you borrow others\u2019 cars?Vehicle owners are allowed to lend out their car on occasion without penalty, as long as the driver they\u2019re handing the keys to has a valid license and there\u2019s no reason to believe they will be reckless. But such permissive use coverage is intended for occasional drivers.If you regularly borrow a car from someone \u2014 such as sharing a family vehicle or driving your partner\u2019s car on a daily basis \u2014 you may need to be added to their policy as an authorized driver.Many carriers will require policyholders to add other drivers who live in the home, adult children or acquaintances who frequently drive the vehicle. If you wreck a borrowed vehicle and it\u2019s discovered that you borrow that car all the time but are not added to the policy, the insurance carrier could potentially push back on the claim.Consider your own policyIf you don\u2019t own your own car, you may think you don\u2019t need insurance coverage. However, if you regularly drive other people\u2019s vehicles, you should seriously consider buying a non-owner auto insurance policy.Non-owner car insurance provides you with liability coverage anytime you get behind the wheel of someone else\u2019s car. It doesn\u2019t include comprehensive or collision coverage \u2014 so any vehicle you borrow wouldn\u2019t be covered by this policy \u2014 but is typically more affordable than a standard policy.Depending on the carrier, you may also be able to add PIP, Medpay, and\/or uninsured\/underinsured motorist coverage to protect you if you\u2019re injured in an accident.","Article Anthor":"Stephanie Colestock","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 28, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"19":{"Article Title":"What is a good student loan interest rate?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/student-loan-interest-rates-152429559.html","Article Content":"Student loan interest rates are an annualized representation of the cost of borrowing for your college education. Lenders use your loan's interest rate, balance, and repayment term to determine your monthly payments.Your monthly payment first covers interest accrued since the previous payment, and the remainder pays down your loan balance.Understanding how interest rates on student loans work can give you some insight into your costs and help you determine whether you're paying too much.Factors that influence student loan interest ratesThere are a few different factors that can influence the interest rates on your student loans:Legislation: Prior to 2006, federal student loan interest rates were variable, meaning that they fluctuated with market interest rates. Then, from 2006 to 2012, Congress switched to a fixed rate that remained the same during that period. Starting in 2013, Congress began calculating federal loan rates annually using the 10-year Treasury bill rate. Note that these laws do not affect private student loan interest rates.Loan type: The Department of Education has three different loan programs, each with a different interest rate for each one. With private student loans, interest rates can vary depending on the lender and the type of interest rate you choose.Interest rate type: While federal student loans all have fixed interest rates, private lenders offer both fixed and variable rates. Variable interest rates usually start out lower than fixed rates \u2014 though they can be higher if market rates are currently high \u2014 and they can fluctuate over time based on a benchmark index.Creditworthiness: If you're applying for private student loans, your interest rate will also depend on your credit history, other debt, income, and other factors.The role of loan type and lenderFederal student loans come with standardized interest rates for each program. If you apply for undergraduate loans, for instance, you'll receive the same interest rate as everyone else who applies for undergraduate loans in the same year.Because federal student loan interest rates are fixed, you don't have to worry about your rate \u2014 and, therefore, your monthly payment \u2014 to change. They also tend to be lower than private student loans on average because they're a form of financial aid.In contrast, private student loan companies set their own interest rates and often provide a range based on creditworthiness. For example, the best student loans may come with an annual percentage rate (APR) ranging from 4.5% to 17%. Because private lenders also typically offer both fixed and variable rates, you may have the choice between the two.The impact of credit score and co-signersMost federal student loan programs don't require a credit check when you apply, and you don't need a co-signer to get approved. If you're a graduate or professional student or a parent, you'll typically undergo a credit check, but only to ensure that you don't have any major negative items on your credit reports.But if you qualify, you'll get the same interest rate as everyone else.With private student loans, your credit score is an important factor in determining your interest rate. Lenders typically require a minimum credit score in the mid-600s, though a score in the mid-700s or higher will give you a better chance of securing a low rate.If you can't get approved for a low interest rate, you can improve your odds by applying with a creditworthy co-signer. Because a co-signer agrees to pay back the debt if you can't, the lender will use their credit score, income and other factors during the underwriting process, which can help you save money.Average interest rates for different types of loansInterest rates constantly change, so it's important to check up-to-date information before applying. With that said, here are the federal student loan interest rates for the 2023-24 school year:Direct undergraduate loans: 5.50%Direct graduate and professional loans: 7.05%Direct PLUS loans: 8.05%As of August 2023, the average fixed rate among the top private lenders is 9.62% for undergraduate loans and 9.51% for graduate loans.And remember, while variable interest rates can start out lower than fixed rates, you're taking a risk that rates will increase in the future, making your loans more expensive than a fixed-rate private student loan.Factors behind high interest ratesBecause federal student loan interest rates are standardized, increasing rates on federal loans are generally due to changes in economic conditions that result in a higher 10-year Treasury bill rate. Inflation and monetary policies by the Federal Reserve are among the biggest drivers of high Treasury rates.Private lenders also typically increase their interest rates in response to the Federal Reserve's monetary policies. When the inflation rate is high, the Fed raises its federal funds rate to increase the cost of borrowing \u2014 the goal is to reduce consumer spending, which can help bring down the inflation rate.The federal funds rate directly influences the prime rate, which lenders often use as a benchmark for their own interest rates. Within the range a private lender provides, yours may be high if the lender considers you to be a risky borrower \u2014 for example, a low credit score or income may increase the chances of default.What's a good interest rate?Because interest rates on student loans are constantly changing, it's important to check current rates to get an idea of what you should shoot for. Because federal student loan interest rates are generally low and standardized, so they're a good benchmark.If you're applying for private student loans, rates can range from roughly 4.5% to 17%, depending on the lender. You'll want to try to secure an interest rate on the low end of that spectrum.Comparison to other loan typesStudent loans are a form of unsecured credit, meaning you don't need to put up collateral to get approved. Other loan types, such as mortgage and auto loans, may offer lower interest rates because they're secured by collateral. But depending on economic conditions, federal student loan rates can be lower.But other types of unsecured loans, including personal loans and credit cards, typically charge higher interest rates. Here's a quick comparison of average rates as of September 2023:Understanding the impact of interest rates on loan costYour student loan interest has a direct impact on your overall loan cost. Because student loans can have repayment terms as long as 30 years, even a small change in your rate can make a big difference.For example, let's say you have $30,000 in student loans with a 10-year repayment term and a 5% interest rate. Your monthly payment would be $318.20, and you'd pay roughly $8,183 in interest. If we change the rate to 5.5%, your monthly payment would only increase by roughly $7, which translates to approximately $900 more in interest.As a result, it's crucial that you research and compare all of your options to ensure you get the best student loan interest rate possible.Tips for securing favorable student loan interest ratesWhether you're a college student or a parent, here are some steps you can take to ensure you get the lowest student loan interest rate:Generally, stick to federal loans: If you're a college student, you're more likely to get a low rate through a federal student loan than to try your luck with private lenders. Even if you're a parent, federal student loans can have competitive rates, as well as generous relief options if you struggle with repayment.Shop around: If you've exceeded your allotment of federal student loans, take your time to shop around and compare interest rates from multiple private lenders to get an idea of which one will offer you the best deal.Improve your credit: The higher your credit score, the better your odds of getting approved for a low interest rate on a private student loan.Find a co-signer: If you're struggling to get a low private loan interest rate on your own, consider asking a parent or other loved one with good credit to apply with you as a co-signer.Improving credit score and co-signer strategyIf you're a graduate school student or a parent and considering private student loans, it's important to prepare your credit before you apply. Here are some steps you can take:Always pay your bills on time and get caught up on past-due payments.Check your credit score to gauge your overall credit health.Review your credit reports for specific issues you can address.Pay down credit card balances.Pay off small-balance loans.Ask a family member or friend with good credit to add you as an authorized user on their credit card account.If you need a co-signer, it's best to ask a family member who has good credit. If that doesn't work, consider a close friend or a mentor. Just keep in mind that co-signing a student loan application makes that person responsible for payments if you fail to, so it's important to make sure they understand the implications before agreeing.Addressing high interest ratesIf you have student loans with high interest rates, you may have some options available to you to limit your costs.If you have federal student loans, there's no program offered by the Department of Education that can reduce your interest rate. In fact, the direct loan consolidation program, which you can use to combine multiple loans into one, typically results in a slightly higher weighted-average rate compared to the loans you want to consolidate.However, you may consider some options:Setting up autopay: Whether you have federal or private student loans, you can typically get a 0.25% discount on your interest rate by setting up automatic payments.Getting on an income-driven repayment plan: If you have federal student loans, an income-driven repayment plan won't reduce your interest rate. But it can reduce your monthly payment to make it more manageable, and it can even open up opportunities for forgiveness down the road.Refinancing: Depending on your credit score and income, you may qualify for a lower rate than what you're currently paying with a student loan refinance. You can even add a co-signer to improve your chances.Refinancing may be a no-brainer if you have private student loans and can save money with a refinance loan. But if you have federal loans, keep in mind that you'll lose access to certain benefits, including access to student loan forgiveness programs, income-driven repayment plans and generous forbearance and deferment options.Before you decide to refinance federal student loans with a private lender, think carefully about your job and income stability, as well as your eligibility for forgiveness, to determine if it's the right decision for you.","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 28, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"20":{"Article Title":"Student Loan 101: Are Federal or Private Loans Better?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/are-federal-or-private-loans-better-175200294.html","Article Content":"Aleksei Naumov via Getty ImagesIf you need to borrow money to pay for college, you're not alone. The College Board reported that 54% of bachelor's degree recipients from public and private nonprofit universities graduate with student loan debt.The two main types of student loans are federal loans and private loans. Which type of student loan you use can impact your repayment options and overall cost.Are federal or private loans better? The answer to that question depends on your program, finances, and eligibility for financial aid.What are federal student loans?Federal student loans are a type of student loan where the U.S. Department of Education acts as the lender. They make up the vast majority of outstanding loans. In fact, federal loans make up 92.78% of the $1.76 trillion national student loan debt.Financial experts and organizations like the National Association of Financial Aid Administrators, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and The Institute for College Access & Success all stressed exhausting all federal financial aid \u2014 including federal student loans \u2014 before turning to private loans. Why? They usually have lower rates than private loans, and the government provides more borrower protections and repayment options than private lenders.For students and their parents, there are four different types of student loans available from the federal government:Direct Subsidized: These loans are for undergraduate students only. Students must have significant financial needs. The government waives the interest that accrues while the student is in school, during the loan grace period and any periods of deferment.Direct Unsubsidized: Direct Unsubsidized can be used for undergraduate or graduate programs; loans used for graduate school will have higher rates. The student is responsible for all interest that accrues.Grad PLUS: Graduate and professional students can use Grad PLUS Loans to borrow up to the total cost of attendance of their program.Parent PLUS: Parents can borrow money to pay for their biological or adopted child's undergraduate education.All federal loans have fixed interest rates, and all borrowers \u2014 regardless of credit or income \u2014 qualify for the same rate for that type of loan. The default repayment term for all federal student loans is 10 years.What is a private student loan?Private loans make up a small part \u2014 just 7% \u2014 of the overall student loan market. Whereas the federal government issues federal loans, private student loans can come from banks, credit unions and other financial institutions.Although federal loans have fixed rates, private student loans can have fixed or variable rates. Variable-rate loans typically have lower initial rates than fixed-rate loans, but the rates can change over time. And repayment terms can range from five to 15 years.Students can use private student loans to pay for undergraduate or graduate programs. However, private loans are credit-based, meaning lenders have strict borrower requirements, and not everyone will qualify for a loan.Private loan eligibilityAlthough requirements vary by lender, private lenders generally require borrowers to have good to excellent credit \u2014 meaning a FICO credit score of 670 or better \u2014 and meet certain income requirements.Since college students may not have good credit (or any credit history at all) and are unlikely to have a substantial source of income, most students will need a parent or relative to co-sign the loan with them. By co-signing the loan, the relative shares responsibility for the loan's repayment. If the primary borrower falls behind, the co-signer has to make payments in their place.6 key differences between federal and private loansWhen considering which types of student loans to use, consider these six essential differences:1. Annual and lifetime borrowing limitsAnnual and lifetime borrowing limits are very different between federal and private student loans, with private loans having higher maximums.The federal government established caps on Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized student loans. Depending on your dependency status and the year of college you're entering, the annual maximum ranges from $3,500 to $12,500 for undergraduate students and up to $20,500 for graduate students.An aggregate or lifetime maximum also applies. It ranges from $31,000 to $57,500 for undergraduate students, and $138,500 for graduate students (that number includes all federal student loans you used for undergraduate study too).With private loans, lenders rarely have a fixed maximum; instead, they allow students and parents to borrow up to the total cost of attendance for their program. Because their lending maximums aren't as restrictive as federal loans, they are a useful option for borrowers that have reached the annual or lifetime borrowing limits and need additional cash to pay for school.2. Credit and income criteriaFederal loans are typically easier to qualify for than federal loans. Federal student loans have no minimum income requirements, and Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized don't involve credit checks.Applicants for federal PLUS Loans will undergo a credit check, but the credit inquiry is less intensive. Rather than looking for a specific FICO score or better, the government reviews your credit report to see if you have an adverse credit history, meaning recent major credit issues like foreclosure, vehicle repossession or collections.Requirements for private loans are more strict. Borrowers usually need to have established credit histories and FICO scores of 670 or better and meet income minimums. If they don't meet the lender's requirements, the only way to qualify for a loan is to add a co-signer to their application.3. Interest rates and type of interestFederal loans always have fixed rates, and the rates for undergraduate loans tend to be low. They also have disbursement fees deducted from the loan when it is issued to you. These are the rates and fees for federal loans issued between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024:Private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates, and they rarely have origination or disbursement fees. Rates vary by lender and whether the loan is used for undergraduate or graduate programs. As of July 2023, rates ranged from 4.44% to 18.00% for variable-rate loans, and fixed-rate loans ranged from 4.42% to 18.00%. Out of the 10 lenders we evaluated, none charged disbursement fees.Important: Grad and Parent PLUS Loans have the highest interest rate ever since the Direct Loan program was launched. Borrowers with excellent credit may qualify for private graduate or parent loans with lower rates, but keep in mind that private loans lack some of the benefits and protections of federal loans.4. In-school payment plansFederal student loans tend to be more generous in terms of in-school repayment than private lenders. Students do not have to make payments while they're in school or during their grace periods, a period of six months after they graduate or leave college.With private student loans, you may have to make payments while you're in college. Private lenders typically have several in-school repayment options. Depending on the lender, you may be able to choose from the following plans:Immediate: As soon as the loan is disbursed, you begin making full principal and interest payments each month.Interest-only: After the loan is issued, you make monthly payments to cover the accrued interest while you're in school. Once you graduate, the payments increase, so you also pay toward the principal.Fixed: With a fixed payment plan, you pay a specific amount, such as $25 per month, while in college. Once you graduate, the payments increase to cover the principal and interest.Deferred: If you opt for deferred repayment, you don't have to make any payments until after you graduate. Because interest accrues during your time in school, the deferred payment plan has the highest overall repayment cost.5. Repayment and hardship options after graduationWhere federal student loans stand out is in borrower protection. Depending on your situation, you may qualify for the following options:If you're ill or unemployed: If you become seriously ill or lose your job, you may be eligible for a federal deferment program. With these programs, you can postpone your payments for several months at a time.If you return to school: If you decide to return to school to earn another degree, you can defer your federal student loan payments until after you graduate from the new program or leave school.If your payment is too high: If you cannot afford the monthly payments under a standard 10-year repayment plan, you may be eligible for an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. The payments are based on a percentage of your discretionary income, and some borrowers qualify for payments as low as $0.6. Loan forgiveness eligibilityFederal student loans are often eligible for loan forgiveness programs. For example:Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Borrowers may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and get up to 100% of their outstanding loans forgiven after meeting the program's eligibility requirements. They must work for an eligible non-profit organization or government office full-time for at least 10 years and make 120 qualifying monthly payments.Teacher Loan Forgiveness: Teachers that teach high-need subjects in low-income schools or education service agencies for at least five years can qualify for up to $17,500 of loan forgiveness.Income-Driven Repayment Discharge: If you sign up for an IDR plan and still have outstanding federal loans at the end of your loan term, the government will discharge the remainder.Private student loans aren't eligible for federal loan forgiveness programs like PSLF or Teacher Loan Forgiveness. But they may qualify for state loan repayment programs based on your employment or for employer repayment assistance.Are federal or private loans better?Federal student loans are the better starting point for most borrowers, but private student loans can fulfill a need if you reach the annual or aggregate borrowing limits, or don't qualify for federal student loans. Taking out a private loan could allow you to complete your program and earn the degree you otherwise wouldn't be able to finance.","Article Anthor":"Kat Tretina","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 28, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"21":{"Article Title":"How does uninsured motorist coverage work?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-does-uninsured-motorist-coverage-work-213348857.html","Article Content":"sabelskaya via Getty ImagesLiability auto insurance is a requirement in most states, but approximately 1 in 8 drivers don\u2019t have insurance, according to the Insurance Research Council. If you get into an accident with an uninsured driver, you could be on the hook for paying thousands in medical bills or car repair costs.Having an auto policy that includes uninsured motorist coverage can help you avoid a bunch of out-of-pocket costs if a driver without insurance crashes into you.What is uninsured motorist coverage?Uninsured motorist coverage, or UM coverage, is insurance that protects you, your passengers, and your vehicle if you are the victim in an accident caused by a driver without car insurance.While about 13% of drivers nationwide are uninsured, the proportion in individual states varies. According to the Insurance Research Council\u2019s most recent study, New Jersey has the lowest percentage of uninsured drivers with an estimated 3%. Mississippi, on the other hand, has the highest percentage of uninsured drivers at just over 29%.To offset the risk posed by uninsured motorists, several states have laws requiring drivers to maintain some type of uninsured motorist insurance. These states are:ConnecticutWashington, D.C.IllinoisMaineMarylandMinnesotaNebraskaNew JerseyNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOregonSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaVermontVirginiaWest VirginiaWisconsinTypes of uninsured motorist insuranceThere are two types: uninsured motorist bodily injury (UMBI) coverage and uninsured motorist property damage (UMPD) coverage.Uninsured motorist bodily injury coverageUninsured motorist bodily injury coverage helps cover medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and potentially funeral expenses after you\u2019re in an auto accident with an uninsured motorist.Typically, if you\u2019re in a car accident, the insurance company of the driver who is at fault would cover the expenses that arise (unless you\u2019re in a no-fault state). If the at-fault driver doesn\u2019t have insurance and can\u2019t cover the expenses on their own, you could be facing thousands of dollars worth of medical bills, lost wages, long-term care, and other expenses.In some states, uninsured motorist bodily injury coverage can be used by victims of a hit-and-run accident. This type of coverage can even protect pedestrians who are hit by vehicles driven by uninsured motorists.Although adding uninsured motorist coverage to your policy will increase your premium, it\u2019s usually a fairly nominal amount. You typically won\u2019t have to pay a deductible before this coverage kicks in.It\u2019s recommended that you choose policy limits for uninsured motorist coverage similar to your liability coverage limits. For example, if your liability limits are set at $25,000 per individual and $50,000 per accident, you should opt for $25,000\/$50,000 limits for your UM coverage as well.Some states will allow what\u2019s known as \"stacking\" when you have multiple vehicles on your auto insurance policy. Stacking lets you multiply your coverage limits by the number of cars on your policy. For instance, if your limits were 25\/50 and you had three cars on your policy, you could stack that coverage so that you could get up to $75,000 per person and $150,000 per accident.Uninsured motorist property damage coverageUninsured motorist property damage coverage helps you pay for damage to your vehicle or other property (such as a fence or house) following an accident caused by an uninsured driver.It may also be used for other related expenses, such as covering your collision coverage deductible or the cost of a rental car while your vehicle\u2019s being repaired.By selecting coverage limits that match up with the value of your vehicle, you can avoid taking a financial loss if your vehicle is totaled.Uninsured motorist property damage coverage isn\u2019t available in every state and may require a deductible.What is an underinsured driver?Similar to uninsured motorist coverage, auto coverage known as underinsured motorist (UIM) insurance can be included on your car insurance policy to cover injury or loss stemming from an accident with a driver who doesn\u2019t have enough insurance.A driver could be considered underinsured if they have less coverage than the minimum state requirements or if they cause an accident resulting in more injuries or damage than is covered by their insurance policy.Depending on your state, uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage may be bundled together. Like uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist insurance is divided into the same two components.Underinsured motorists bodily injury coverageUnderinsured motorist bodily injury (UIMBI) coverage pays for medical bills, wage loss, pain and suffering, and funeral expenses following an accident with a driver who is underinsured. It\u2019s similar to UMBI coverage, except in this case, the driver does carry insurance \u2013 just not enough to cover all the injury-related expenses.Consider a scenario in which a driver causes a multi-vehicle pileup, seriously injuring five people. If the driver\u2019s liability insurance pays a maximum of $20,000 per accident, that probably wouldn\u2019t be enough to cover all the doctor bills and medical payments.Having underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage can help cover your expenses after an at-fault driver\u2019s insurance coverage is exhausted.Underinsured motorist property damage coverageUnderinsured motorist property damage (UIMPD) coverage pays for damage to vehicles and property after an accident caused by a driver who has insurance but not enough to cover all the damage they caused.If someone totals your expensive sports car in an accident, for example, their insurance coverage limits may not be enough to replace your vehicle. With underinsured motorist property damage coverage, your insurance can help make up the difference. Yahoo Personal FinanceDo you need uninsured motorist coverage?When deciding whether you should have uninsured motorist coverage, consider your state\u2019s requirements, other insurance coverage you have, your risk tolerance, and your financial ability to cover out-of-pocket expenses.Your state\u2019s requirements and risk factorsAs mentioned, several states require drivers to have uninsured motorist coverage when registering a vehicle. A handful of them also require underinsured motorist coverage. If you live and drive in those states, your decision is made up for you \u2013 you\u2019ll need to get that additional coverage.You can also opt into purchasing uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage on your own. Consider your risk tolerance and how comfortable you\u2019d feel covering car repairs or medical bills if an uninsured driver crashed into you.The prevalence of uninsured drivers in your state is another factor. According to the Insurance Research Council, the 10 states with the highest percentage of insured drivers are:Mississippi \u2013 29.4%Michigan \u2013 25.5%Tennessee \u2013 23.7%New Mexico \u2013 21.8%Washington \u2013 21.7%Florida \u2013 20.4%Alabama \u2013 19.5%Arkansas \u2013 19.3%Washington, D.C. \u2013 19.1%California \u2013 16.6%The 10 states with the lowest percentage of insured drivers are:New Jersey \u2013 3.1%Massachusetts \u2013 3.5%New York \u2013 4.1%Maine \u2013 4.9%Wyoming \u2013 5.8%Pennsylvania \u2013 6.0%New Hampshire \u2013 6.1%Connecticut \u2013 6.3%Utah \u2013 6.5%North Carolina and South Dakota (tied) \u2013 7.4%What happens if you don\u2019t have uninsured motorist coverage?If your state doesn\u2019t require you to have uninsured motorist coverage, you might still be able to purchase it from your insurance company. However, you can choose not to.In the event that you do get into an accident caused by an uninsured driver, you might have to pay for your own medical bills and car repair costs if the responsible driver can\u2019t cover those expenses for you.If you have health insurance, your medical bills following an accident might be covered, but you may have a copay, co-insurance, or a high deductible to meet first. Even if your auto insurance policy includes personal injury protection (PIP), it may not be enough to cover all the expenses related to your car accident injury.Having short- or long-term disability coverage can be useful, but it\u2019ll typically only pay a portion of your wages, so you might still experience income loss if you aren\u2019t able to return to work after being in a car accident.Collision insurance may help pay your car repair bills if an uninsured motorist hits your vehicle, but it may not cover damage to a fence, mailbox, house, or other property.If you choose not to get uninsured motorist coverage, it can be helpful to regularly set aside money in a high-yield savings account to cover expenses in case you get into an accident with an uninsured driver. This could be your emergency fund or an account specifically for car-accident-related expenses. You\u2019d essentially become your own insurance plan of sorts \u2013 hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.","Article Anthor":"Nicole Dow","Article Date":"Wed, Sep 27, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"22":{"Article Title":"Shocked by a spike in car insurance rates?

Car insurance costs vary based on location, demographics, number of car accidents, type of vehicle and other factors, but insurance rates are up steeply for most drivers this year.Here's what experts say is behind inflated car insurance prices and what you can do to save money without sacrificing thorough coverage on your vehicles.How much did car insurance increase in 2023?According to the 2023 US Auto Insurance Study from J.D. Power, 31% of car insurance companies operating in the US enacted a rate increase this past year. Overall, the industry reported an average price increase of 15.5% with some states, like Florida, seeing rates rise as much as 88% over the past year.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) confirms that even as inflation eased in 2023, auto insurance costs rose more than 17% for US drivers. Progressive estimates its average cost of car insurance for a liability-only policy ranges from $81-$146 a month. But you might pay far more than that depending on your coverage, driver demographics, vehicle value, and which state you live in.8 ways to save on auto insurance premiumsWhen it comes to personal finance, the forecast isn\u2019t all doom and gloom.

You can also consult with an independent insurance agent to see which insurer might be the best fit for your family or fleet of vehicles.4. Consider telematicsMost insurance companies now offer discounts through usage-based insurance. Drivers download an app or install a plug-in device that monitors mileage, driving habits, speed, and more.According to TransUnion, the usage of telematics surged 33% in early 2022 as inflation drove drivers to seek out deeper discounts on car insurance.5. Maximize insurance discountsInsurance companies offer a full menu of discounts and it can be difficult to ascertain if you\u2019re taking advantage of everything you\u2019re eligible for.Ask about student discounts, senior discounts, military and veteran discounts, and any discounts for safe driving, taking a defensive driving course, or enrolling in traffic school.6. Bundle with your renters or homeowners insuranceMcCartin, the agent, says drivers struggling with their insurance bill need to realize everyone is in the same situation.\"There are not a lot of options when it comes to auto insurance and reducing rates right now,\" McCartin advises. \"Bundle your coverage with the same company for home and auto for a bigger discount.\"7. Work to raise your credit scoreWhat's your credit score got to do with your car insurance? It turns out quite a lot. Insurance companies use a credit-based insurance score (CBIS) in their underwriting process to determine insurance rates. Making bill payments on time, paying down debt, and using credit cards responsibly will all improve your credit score and deem you less risky to insurers.8. Avoid reducing your coverage.You could try to raise your deductible or drop extra coverage, but carrying the minimum coverage on your vehicle that the state will allow is almost never advisable. Instead, try creative solutions to save money and reduce your insurance premiums, like enrolling in paperless billing, or paying annually.\"Take the highest deductible you can afford that makes sense,\" McCartin warns. \"But be mindful that at some point the savings does not justify the additional increase in a deductible.\" Yahoo Personal FinanceWhat\u2019s causing car insurance rate hikes?Curious why you\u2019re suddenly paying more, even for the same car insurance policy you had last year?Experts say rising car insurance premiums are a result of several factors converging over the past few years to create steep losses for insurance companies and thus a steep increase in insurance rates.Here are just a few of the factors driving auto insurance rate hikes.High repair costsRising repair costs are being attributed to more expensive auto parts, aging vehicles, supply chain concerns, and labor shortages. Similar to auto insurance rate hikes, the CPI reports the cost of vehicle maintenance and repairs rose about 20% for most customers in 2023.McCartin says vehicle repair costs are indeed part of the problem. \u201cParts and labor costs have increased, many shops are short-handed so it takes longer to fix cars which means people are in a rental car for a longer period of time.\u201dClimate changeInsurance company losses have hit historic highs as more frequent natural disasters and severe weather driven by climate change generate more claims for larger payouts. These types of catastrophic claims affect both auto and home insurance rates.State Farm, one of the largest insurers in the US, received permission to institute more than 65 rate hikes across 29 different states in early 2023 due to extraordinary losses.Rise in used car pricesAlongside other factors, the value of a used car can significantly affect the cost of coverage. Edmunds reports that used vehicle prices remain historically high with an average increase in value of 44% since 2018.Increase in severity of insurance claimsNow that most cars have returned to the road post-pandemic, so too have more accidents. According to a State Farm media release in early 2023, the company attributes its unprecedented $13.2 billion underwriting loss in 2022 to the increased severity of auto insurance claims.Worters confirms this has been a significant concern for auto insurers over the past year.\"It really is a convergence of factors, including rising insurer losses due to increasing accident frequency and severity,\" she said. \"There are also more fatalities and injuries on the road, leading to increased attorney involvement in claims.\"","Article Anthor":"Kaz Weida","Article Date":"Wed, Sep 27, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"23":{"Article Title":"How a government shutdown would impact your money: Student loans, Social Security, investments, and more","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/government-shutdown-money-153356710.html","Article Content":"filo via Getty ImagesThe offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money.If we were to manage our finances like the US government, we'd pay our utility bills just hours before service was shut off. Sometimes, only after we're sitting in the dark.A government shutdown is looming on Oct. 1 because Congress hasn't allocated the funds to pay existing bills. It's similar to last June when US leaders agonized over raising the debt ceiling, an imaginary line in the sand on spending.These persistent standoffs don't lower the national debt. They simply delay the payment of salaries, operational expenses, and services \u2014 and are likely to continue because that's how Washington works.Here's how a government shutdown might affect you personally.Student loansA government shutdown can have a major impact on student loan borrowers. The government may temporarily lay off employees \u2014 including a majority of those working for the Department of Education.In 2021, the DOE released a contingency plan in the event of a government shutdown, which said the DOE would \"phase in employees only as necessary to support and prevent significant damage.\" At most, it said, \"not more than 11 percent of the total staff would be called back to work during a longer interruption.\"The operations that would come to a halt largely affect grants \u2013 specifically, review of grant applications and awarding of grant funds.DOE programs with mandatory funding, such as the Pell Grant and Federal Direct Student Loan programs, can still make payments during a shutdown. However, it may only be for a limited time \u2014 as long as funds are still available.What\u2019s different about this potential shutdown? After a three-year student loan moratorium, federal student loan providers are bracing for an overwhelming influx of payments on Oct. 1.Having fewer federal employees on the clock could make it more difficult to ask questions or resolve issues related to your student loans.Federal programs and Social Security, Medicare, and MedicaidSocial Security checks and electronic payments would still be delivered even if the government shuts down. Medicare and Medicaid programs are also protected from federal funding shortfalls.We\u2019ll repeat that for those in the back: Retirees will still get their monthly Social Security checks and healthcare benefits will not be disrupted.SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) and WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) benefits can continue if the funding shutdown is not for an extended time. Operating on a tight budget, WIC may be the most vulnerable.TravelMany federal workers, including airport security and air traffic control, are considered essential and required to continue furloughed work during a government shutdown. But you should still be prepared for potential delays and slower wait times at the airport.During the last shutdown, travelers experienced longer lines at TSA checkpoints, flight delays, and other disruptions to their travel.Other services may differ. If you need to update your passport or obtain a visa before travel, the US State Department says services will be operational as long as fees are available to support them. Still, issuance of passports could be delayed. Additionally, it\u2019s possible national parks and museums could close, or offer only limited services.In short: The longer a potential shutdown drags on, the more disruptive it could be to your travel plans.If you\u2019re concerned about long security lines, consider signing up for TSA PreCheck now. Several credit cards offer a credit toward your application fee, including the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae, Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, and Bank of America\u00ae Premium Rewards\u00ae credit card.You may not qualify for coverage if you miss your flight due to long security lines, but travel insurance could also be useful in the case of a flight delay or cancellation. Some credit cards with travel insurance include the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card and The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express. Always read the fine print to ensure a policy covers what you need, and don\u2019t forget to also check your airline or hotel\u2019s flexible cancellation policies.Read more: Government shutdowns usually cause trouble at airports. This time could be worse.The economy and your investmentsThe impact on the economy, including your investments, will depend on the length of a government shutdown. Since government payments are delayed, not diminished, the effect may be minor if congressional leaders resolve the matter quickly.During the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted a little over two weeks, 40% of Americans cut their consumer spending, according to a Goldman Sachs survey.For the stock and bond markets, investor sentiment may be jarred over the short term. That could mean temporary market volatility. In other words, you might not want to check your 401(k) retirement balance or mutual fund statements quite so often. Remember, your long-term investments will likely weather any week-to-week losses if you don't sell during a shutdown fluster.Interest payments on Treasurys would continue.Learn more about high-yield savings, money market, and CD savings accounts.Government paychecksIn the event of a government shutdown, nonessential federal employees won't be paid until the government reopens. Contractors and private companies serving the government may institute temporary employment cutbacks.\"Troops would go without pay. Military families would be impacted, of course,\" Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said this week. \"For folks that are not getting paychecks, that impacts how and when [they] can buy groceries, child care, all of these things.\"Commissaries would be closed on most US military bases, however, while some regional offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs may be temporarily closed, benefits and VA hospitals are unaffected.Other servicesHere are more federal services and how they\u2019re touched by a potential shutdown:Post office and mail delivery: UnaffectedFederal courts: They will remain open.The IRS and tax collections: The agency will likely reduce staff, so the phones may not be answered \u2014 but payments will be collected.Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

But if you\u2019re on a shoestring budget, saving for your own burial expenses might be a little daunting.In 2021, the National Funeral Directors Association data indicates the median cost of an adult funeral was $7,848 with viewing and burial. Fortunately, burial insurance is an affordable tool that can help cover those funeral costs as well as other end-of-life expenses.What is burial insurance?Burial insurance, sometimes referred to as funeral insurance or final expense life insurance, is a type of whole life insurance designed to cover the costs associated with burial, funeral home services, and other final expenses.There are several kinds of burial insurance policies, and while each offers a death benefit, there are specific differences in coverage and how benefits are structured.In general, funeral insurance isn\u2019t designed to leave a large amount of money to your beneficiaries. Instead, it\u2019s a way for the insured to provide financial support after their death so their families don't have to run up credit card bills trying to carry out end-of-life wishes.How does burial insurance work?Burial insurance works differently depending on whether you\u2019ve opted for a traditional life insurance policy that covers burial expenses or a final expense policy through a funeral home. The following are the three main types of burial policies.Simplified life insuranceA simplified life insurance policy requires the insured to answer basic health-related questions, although a medical exam is not necessary. While these burial life insurance policies are more affordable than guaranteed issue policies, simplified life insurance coverage usually has a graded death benefit. That means your beneficiaries don\u2019t get the full insurance payout if you pass within a few years of taking out the policy.Guaranteed issue life insuranceGuaranteed issue policies are pretty much what they sound like. You\u2019ll have to be 50 or older to qualify, but there are no health questions or medical exams and you can\u2019t be denied coverage. The premiums for this type of whole life insurance can be expensive and return relatively small death benefits.Pre-need insuranceThis type of burial policy isn\u2019t offered through traditional life insurance companies. Instead, a funeral home can offer pre-need funeral insurance that will cover funeral expenses and other costs associated with arrangements. The caveat is that the funeral director needs to be a licensed insurance agent, and the full death amount goes directly to the funeral homes to cover funeral costs.The advantage to contracting with a life insurance company or burial insurance company versus a funeral home is that a whole life policy from an insurance company has cash value. This means once your beneficiaries cover the cost of your funeral expenses, the remaining funds can be used to pay other final expenses such as medical bills.Read more: The total guide to life insuranceWhat does a burial insurance policy cover?Depending on the type of policy, burial insurance can cover specific funeral costs or a wide array of other expenses associated with the end of life. Here are a few of the costs to consider when you\u2019re deciding your coverage amount.Burial plot or cremationEmbalming or preservationGrave and headstoneObituary noticesCasket or urnFlowersTransportationMusicFuneral or memorial service feesIf you\u2019ve chosen a whole life insurance policy, there are a few other expenses the death benefit can be used to pay such as medical bills, legal costs, or even the insured\u2019s outstanding debt such as mortgage loans or personal loans. Consult the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to understand what happens to debts upon death and who\u2019s financially responsible.Burial insurance policy vs. life insurance policyMost burial insurance policies are a type of life insurance policy. In fact, some insurance companies don\u2019t even offer stand-alone burial insurance.Burial insurance is really just a term for whole or universal life insurance that pays a small death benefit to cover the deceased person\u2019s final expenses. Term life insurance pays out a larger death benefit meant to replace the income of the deceased person to support their beneficiaries.If you\u2019re under 50 and have a young family, the generous death benefit of a term life insurance policy is probably more appropriate for your situation. If you\u2019re over 50 and retired, the lower cost of burial insurance may make more sense.Read more: What is term life insurance?How much does burial insurance cost?Burial insurance premiums are fairly affordable, even for older applicants. However, coverage and benefit amounts can vary depending on whether the insured is willing to answer a policy health questionnaire and how much underwriting is involved.eFinancial, an insurance marketplace, says final expense insurance rates start at $53 per month with coverage ranging from $5,000 to $35,000. Choice Mutual has a more specific breakdown where 50-70-year-olds pay premiums anywhere from $12-$193 per month depending on age, gender, health conditions, and the coverage needed.How much burial insurance do I need?Given that the average cost of a funeral is over $7,000 depending on whether cremation or burial is involved, most burial insurance policy coverage starts at a death benefit of $5,000.To decide how much coverage you\u2019ll need, consider the funeral costs outlined on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website or use the New York Life online funeral cost and final expense calculator.Alternatives to traditional burial or funeral insuranceIf you\u2019re trying to decide if burial insurance is worth it or looking to save money, consider the following alternatives.Burial or other trustYou can work with an attorney to create a trust that would set aside money for funeral costs and name a trustee that could withdraw the money upon your death. In this case the trust owns the life insurance policy.Payable on death (POD)Some banks offer an option to create an account that\u2019s payable upon presentation of a certified death certificate to a specific beneficiary. POD accounts avoid having funds tied up in probate and allow you to still access the money while you\u2019re alive.Savings accountYou can also squirrel away funds for a funeral in a joint savings account. However, these types of accounts can get tied up in probate so they\u2019re not always the best solution to address immediate end-of-life needs like funeral expenses.What happens when there\u2019s no money for a funeral?And last but not least, what happens if there isn\u2019t any cash on hand for a funeral? A few of the following programs work to subsidize funeral costs for families.Veterans burial benefitsThe federal government\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs works to defer the funeral costs of both veterans and active-duty military personnel. The amount awarded or reimbursed depends on several factors, including when the death occurred and if it was service-related.FEMA assistanceThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) works with state agencies to cover the costs related to funerals for many natural disasters, including COVID-19-related deaths. See the FEMA website for more information about how to apply for assistance.State government assistanceIf you can\u2019t afford a funeral for a loved one, many states have organizations that work to provide relief and funeral services. You can search a state-by-state directory of burial assistance programs here.Victim compensation fundsIf the deceased was the victim of a crime, the family may be entitled to financial support for funeral-related costs from the state crimes victims compensation fund. You can learn more information on the federal benefits website.","Article Anthor":"Kaz Weida","Article Date":"Tue, Sep 26, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"25":{"Article Title":"How to buy a house in 2023","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-to-buy-a-house-in-2023-144721139.html","Article Content":"lemono via Getty ImagesIf you could have chosen any year to buy a home, what would it have been? 2021, when rates were sub-3%? Or in 1981, when mortgages were over 18%? Yeah, that's an easy one. But maybe you didn't have the down payment in the bank two or three years ago. Or, for any number of reasons, you just weren't ready to buy a house.Now it's 2023, mortgage rates are around 7%, home prices are still elevated, and you're thinking, \"Great. It's the worst possible time to buy a house.\"But is it?Buying a house in 2023: What you need to knowThe elephant in the living room of that dream home you want to buy is the combination of high mortgage rates and home prices. The interest rate you will likely pay today was last seen in 2002. The median home price then was around $170,000. Today, the median house price is over $400,000.Mortgage rates bounced up and down in the 7% range in the 1990s, too. And in the early '70s. They've been much, much higher \u2014 and much lower. That's what mortgage rates do.However, over the decades, despite the cyclical nature of mortgage rates, median home prices have generally risen throughout interest rate cycles.Of course, as you can see by the occasional dips (or cliffs) in home values, including the five-year drop beginning in 2007 and the most recent fall in prices, houses don't always appreciate over the short term. Much like the stock market, a home is a buy-and-hold asset.So, presently, interest rates are no longer historically low, and home prices have been on an increasing trajectory for decades. Choosing to buy a home based on the perfect timing of low mortgage rates and affordable home prices is rarely, if ever, possible. Over the long term, home prices are likely to continue appreciating, and since rates move up and down over time, refinancing opportunities may crop up as the years go on.First-time homebuyers: What's changed in 2023Besides mortgage rates? The most significant change is the share of homebuyers who are first-timers is at its highest level in over a decade. Half of all homebuyers were first-timers in 2022, according to Zillow research.The buying frenzy of bidding wars and red-hot housing markets seen during the years of record-low interest rates is over. Part of the reason is because potential repeat buyers are staying put with their existing low-rate mortgages. With less buying competition, first-time homebuyers may have more of an opening to make a deal.Repeat homebuyers: The 2023 mortgage rate challengeAccording to another Zillow report, current homeowners may stay put for quite some time. The report says that would-be repeat buyers are looking for mortgage rates to dip back down to 4% and 5% before giving up their lower-rate home loan.As a result, buyers are once again seeking out temporary mortgage rate buydowns and adjustable-rate mortgages.Buydowns allow for two to three years of lower-interest payments in exchange for an upfront fee. And ARMs enable buyers to lock in a slightly lower interest rate for a few years before annual or semiannual rate adjustments later. It's essentially a bet that interest rates will head lower in a couple of years, allowing for a fixed-rate refinance.ARMs can also be suitable for buyers expecting to move again before the introductory fixed-rate shifts to variable interest.How much house can I afford?A quick and easy formula for home affordability can be calculating 28% of your monthly before-tax-and-deductions (gross) income. That amount should cover your mortgage payment, insurance, taxes, and other housing costs.Lenders will look for a total debt load of 36% or less of your gross pay. That would include housing costs, plus monthly minimum credit card payments, vehicle loans, personal loans, and any other debt.How much money do I need to buy a house?Now, we're getting to the essential details. Just how much money do you need on hand to buy a house? The down payment will be the biggest chunk of cash that you'll need. That can range from 3% of the purchase price (some lenders even offer 1%-down loans) to the optimum 20%. \"Optimum\" because with 20% or more down, you won\u2019t be charged private mortgage insurance. PMI is a fee that protects the lender in the event that you default on the loan.Other low- and no-down-payment options are available, which we'll cover next.When you make an offer on a house, you'll likely have to put up some earnest money with your written offer. That can be from several hundred to a couple thousand dollars. But don't worry, this isn't a new chunk of cash. It's a small slice from your down payment and will be applied to the total money down later.Then there are closing costs. Figure those will amount to another 3%-4% of the home's selling price.Lenders will also want to see a cash cushion available for maintenance, repairs, furniture, and other related expenses, such as moving costs.Let's do a back-of-an-envelope rough estimate based on a $300,000 home:At the minimum, you might qualify for a conventional loan with a 3% down payment. So that's $9,000. A National Association of Realtors report said that first-time homebuyers typically made a 6% down payment in 2022, while repeat buyers put down 17%. You can adjust your estimate according to your down payment plans.Closing costs could range from $9,000 to $13,000, or 3%-4% of the loan amount. These fees typically include an appraisal, inspection, title insurance and other prepaid and escrow funds required. Your lender will provide details in a Loan Estimate \u2014 and the final figures in a Closing Disclosure three business days before closing.Home maintenance and repairs: It's good practice to have some cash on hand, just in case there are some early expenses to cover. Let's say $1,000 to $2,000.Moving expenses could vary a lot, depending on distance and how much stuff you have. Got friends or relatives with a truck and some strong backs? Maybe $100 for pizza and beer. If not, figure $2,000 to $5,000.That's a ballpark minimum of around $20,000.How to buy a house with no money in 2023Mortgages requiring no down payment are widely available through two primary programs: the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.VA loans are, by far, the most-used method to no-money-down homeownership. As of June 2023, the VA said 3.7 million veterans had active home loans guaranteed by the agency. Loans backed by the VA are issued by mortgage lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and other loan providers. To be eligible, you must be a U.S. veteran, current service member or a qualified surviving spouse.USDA loans are for the funding of a primary residence of low- and moderate-income borrowers \u2014 but aren't just for residences built on property with agricultural purposes. They can be single-family homes in rural and suburban areas, too.If you don't qualify for either of these two government loan programs, there are local and state housing finance agencies that offer aid, grants, and down payment assistance to low- and moderate-income households. There are also programs to assist teachers and first-responders to buy a home.The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has resources to help you learn more about homebuying-assistance programs.The 2023 first-time homebuyer federal tax creditA federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which ended in 2010, has been up for renewal time and time again in Congress, including earlier in 2023. The latest proposed version would allow a $15,000 credit against your federal income tax bill. So far, the measure hasn't been approved.Credit score needed to buy a houseThe lowest interest rates are earned by borrowers with a FICO score of 760 or better, according to credit services provider Experian. More expensive homes are financed with jumbo loans and generally require a credit score of 700 or better.Service members and veterans can tap the benefit of a VA-backed loan, with lenders generally looking for applicants with a 620 FICO score or better. Lenders making conventional loans, which aren't backed by a government agency, also look for credit scores of 620 or higher.Rural and suburban homes might qualify for a USDA loan with a 580 credit score. And you might even be eligible for a mortgage with a credit score as low as 500 with an FHA loan \u2014 but a lender could require 10% cash down.Yahoo Finance tip: Know your credit score and use this calculator to get an idea of the rate you may qualify for.How to buy a house with bad creditAs just noted, FHA offers the lowest credit score hurdle to buying a house, at 500. Having a decent down payment helps make your case with a lender. Of course, working to build your credit score before buying a home is probably the best option. Actions to consider include:Make sure your credit report is accurate. Many people who haven't checked their credit record in a while find long-lingering errors that can be corrected, according to Consumer Reports.Investigate government homebuying-assistance programs as mentioned above.Pay down debt. Every dollar decrease in debt works toward boosting your credit score.Pay every bill on time. And paying early can help polish your credit profile by lowering your credit utilization, a measure of debt used by credit score providers.Finding a co-signer \u2014 perhaps a family member \u2014 with good credit to help guarantee the home loan may also be a path to homeownership until your credit history recovers.Yahoo Finance tip: Getting a mortgage with bad credit means your interest rate will be higher. That can be a long-term penalty for what may be short-term credit issues. Repairing your credit before buying a house might be the best financial decision.How long does it take to buy a house?This question is difficult to answer because it depends on your circumstances. But here are some general parameters.Getting financially prepared can take weeks or months \u2014 or much longer. You\u2019ll also want to get your records in order for the loan underwriting process. That can include tax returns, bank statements, proof of income, and other paperwork.Then there's shopping for a lender and getting a preapproval in hand. That's a week or two, at least.Finding the right house might take a couple of months or more. In 2022, the NAR said it took home shoppers a median of 10 weeks before finding their next address.Making an offer on a house can take a week or two of possible give-and-take bargaining.Then, the mortgage process begins. HUD estimates that lenders will take 3-6 weeks to complete the loan approval process.The three-day countdown to loan signing begins when you receive the Closing Disclosure.Then, an hour or so around the closing table, and you're done.13 steps to buying a home in 2023Breaking down the homebuying process can make it less overwhelming. Here are the landmarks you will want to achieve along the way:1. Know how much house you can affordTo start, you'll want to determine what you can comfortably spend. If you properly gauge your financial capacity, your monthly mortgage payment will feel right from the beginning and get even easier to make over time.Divide your pre-tax monthly salary by four. That's a good start for a target monthly payment. But that's not just principal and interest payments. You will also want to include property taxes and homeowners' insurance in the total. Mortgage lenders often recommend your housing costs total around 28% of your gross pay. That calculation is known as your debt-to-income ratio.2. Be financially preparedYou need to lay a solid financial foundation for homeownership to be comfortable with the ongoing costs of owning a home.Reduce debtPrioritize paying off debt before buying a home. You'll have plenty of new expenses after you move in and will want to have extra spending power available.Check your credit scoreKnowing your credit score is a must. Many financial services providers offer FICO scores for free, and the numbers will vary a bit from each. Knowing generally where you fall on the bad-to-excellent scale will suffice. The higher your score, the better your bargaining power for a lower interest rate and fewer fees.Have a cash cushionLenders want to see that you've got some money left over after making the down payment and covering the closing costs. It doesn't have to be a huge amount, but showing that you have a bit of a cash cushion during the purchase and once in the home is a good thing.3. Bank the down paymentThat lump sum down payment has to be in a savings account or somewhere readily accessible. From the minimum 1% of the purchase price to the preferred 20% down, or anywhere in between, it's got to be money ready to be in motion.4. Shop lenders for the best mortgageIt seems people may have finally learned this lesson. Over the last nearly 10 years, over 60% of homebuyers said they shopped more than one lender, according to Fannie Mae research. Gone are the days when buyers just went with a real estate agent's \"preferred lender,\" no questions asked. Comparison shopping mortgage lenders for the best rate and most favorable fees is a thing. Don't skip it.5. Get preapprovedGetting a written mortgage preapproval in hand is another step rarely taken for granted these days. That's because real estate agents and home sellers want to be sure you're a serious shopper.6. Find a buyer's real estate agentNow you're set to shop for that perfect house. Almost. You need the right real estate agent on your side \u2014 and that's not the seller\u2019s agent shown on the \"for sale\" sign or the \"listing agent\" named in the home\u2019s online profile. Talk to two or three buyer\u2019s agents and find a strong negotiator and advocate.7. Find a house (or two)The fun part: looking at houses. Sure, you skipped down to this house-hunting step a bit early, right? Not to worry, because now that you've completed steps 1 through 6, it's time for a serious search for the perfect home. Attend some open houses and scour the local market for neighborhoods and amenities that best suit you. Find a couple of contenders: one to make an offer on and some backup options if your favorite falls through.8. Make an offerYour buyer's agent will handle the details of making an official offer and negotiating counteroffers.9. Get a home inspection and appraisalThen comes a home inspection and home appraisal. Both protect you from unknown problems and a valuation issue. Inspection issues could include things such as a leaky roof, mold or plumbing and electrical problems. The appraisal assures the lender that the property is worth enough to warrant a loan approval \u2014 and alerts you to the possibility of overpaying for a property that may be worth a lot less than you thought.10. Shop for homeowner's insuranceIt's time to shop again, this round for insurance. Your lender will require it, and of course, you need it. It's another round of comparison shopping between multiple providers. Bundle and save? You've got to put every sales pitch to a numbers test.11. Choose your lender and apply for a mortgageWith an offer in hand, you can get real-deal loan offers. Each lender vying for your business will give you a written offer. If you have each lender provide a zero-discount-points offer, you can compare apples to apples and then decide if you want to buy points to lower your interest rate.12. Do a final walk-throughBefore closing, you'll do one more walk-through with your agent to ensure everything is as promised. Repairs, if any, are completed; things like that.13. Close the loanYou'll face a pile of paperwork, so be patient. Ask questions and understand what you're signing. If there are any last-minute surprises, you can still walk away.

In addition to an assured death benefit, whole life insurance has a built-in savings component called cash value.If you have loved ones who depend on your income, you probably need life insurance. Whole life insurance provides a number of benefits, but it\u2019s also expensive compared to other types of policies. Let\u2019s break down how whole life insurance works and when it makes sense.What is whole life insurance?Whole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance. It\u2019s sometimes referred to as ordinary life insurance.Unlike term life insurance, which only pays a death benefit if you die within a specific number of years, whole life policies and other forms of permanent life insurance will pay a death benefit no matter when you die as long as your policy remains in force. These policies also have a cash value component that grows over time.There are a few important differences between whole life policies and other types of permanent life policies, like universal life insurance and variable life insurance:Whole life insurance has a guaranteed death benefit. As long as you make your premium payments, your loved ones will receive a death benefit when you pass. Universal life and variable life policies offer long-term financial protection, but the death benefits aren\u2019t guaranteed.Cash value grows at a guaranteed rate. With universal life and variable life, cash values fluctuate based on market conditions. The cash value of a whole life insurance policy grows at a rate guaranteed by the insurer.Whole life premiums stay the same throughout the life of the policy. Universal life and variable life offer greater flexibility in that you can adjust your premiums if your needs change.Many whole life policies pay dividends. If you buy participating life insurance, your whole life insurance policy may pay dividends, depending on its financial performance.How much does whole life insurance cost?The cost of a whole life policy depends on several factors, namely your age, health, and the face amount of the policy, i.e. how much the insurer will pay out to beneficiaries when the policyowner dies.Whole life is more expensive than other types of life insurance, including other permanent life options. Premiums on a $500,000 policy, even for a healthy person in their 30s, can cost a few hundred dollars a month. Older people will pay more.Pros and cons of whole life insuranceWhole life insurance offers several benefits for those seeking lifelong coverage, but it isn\u2019t the right choice for everyone.Benefits of whole life insuranceSome of the most important benefits of whole life insurance compared to other types of life insurance include:Guaranteed death benefitWhole life insurance is a good option if you want to leave an inheritance to family members or make a substantial gift to charity when you die. It can be an especially helpful estate-planning tool for parents of special-needs children who want to provide long-term financial security.Permanent coverageWhole life insurance lasts your entire life. The permanent coverage is a key advantage over a term life insurance policy, which only pays a death benefit if you die within the policy\u2019s term, typically between 10 and 30 years.Cash valueYou can borrow against the cash value or make withdrawals from it. Some people use the cash value of whole life insurance to supplement their retirement income. The insurer guarantees the growth rate of the cash value.Fixed premiumsWhole life insurance premiums don\u2019t change during the life of the policy. While you don\u2019t have to worry about the cost increasing, the downside is that there\u2019s little flexibility. Also, premiums cost a lot more in the early years than the cost of insuring your life.Potential for dividendsIf the insurer pays life insurance dividends, your cash value can grow faster than your carrier\u2019s guaranteed rate. You can use the annual dividends to grow your policy\u2019s death benefit or cash value, reduce your premiums, or take them as cash. Bear in mind, though, that dividends aren\u2019t guaranteed.Disadvantages of whole life insuranceWhile the guaranteed death benefits, lifetime coverage and cash value are appealing, there are some drawbacks to whole life insurance that you need to be aware of.High premiumsPerhaps the biggest disadvantage of whole life insurance is the high cost. A whole life policy can be up to 15 times more expensive than a 20- or 30-year term policy with a similar death benefit. Dollar for dollar, term policies allow you to buy a much larger death benefit.Insurers maintain level premiums throughout the life of the policy by charging younger policyholders substantially more than it costs to insure them in the early years. The company uses the high premiums that younger people pay to offset the costs of insuring older people\u2019s lives.Slow cash value accumulationThe cash value accumulation rate that whole life insurance carriers guarantee is relatively low. Universal life insurance and variable life insurance offer higher potential growth, though both require you to assume some market risk. If you don\u2019t need lifetime coverage, skipping permanent coverage altogether and investing the money you\u2019d save on premiums will often yield better returns.Lack of flexibilityA disadvantage of those fixed premiums and guaranteed benefits is that whole life insurance doesn\u2019t allow for much flexibility. Unlike universal and variable life policies, whole life insurance doesn\u2019t give you the option to adjust your premiums and death benefit amounts.High surrender feesCanceling a whole life policy can get complicated. You can surrender your policy in exchange for the cash value, minus fees. The amount you\u2019d receive is known as the cash surrender value. However, these fees can run as high as 10% to 35% of the policy\u2019s cash value. Usually, the fees are especially steep in the early years, then decrease later on.ComplexityBecause it\u2019s both an insurance product and a savings\/investment product, whole life insurance can get confusing. Usually, you\u2019ll need to shop for coverage through a life insurance agent instead of getting quotes online.How whole life insurance worksAs with other life insurance policies, your whole life premiums and death benefits are determined during the underwriting process. Typically, the insurer assesses your risk through a health questionnaire, a life insurance medical exam and third-party information, such as your prescription history and driving record.Whole life premiums are significantly higher compared to other life insurance policies. With any life insurance policy, your premiums go toward the insurer\u2019s overhead expenses, along with the cost of insuring your life. But with whole life coverage, a portion of the premium also goes toward cash value. Because the insurer pays a death benefit as long as you keep the policy active, the cost of insuring your life is high. After all, everyone dies at some point.When you die, your beneficiaries will receive a lump-sum death benefit that\u2019s typically tax-free. However, any remaining cash value that\u2019s left at the time of your passing will go to the life insurance company instead of your beneficiaries.Cash value in whole life insuranceThe cash value of a whole life policy will grow over time, but accumulation is often minimal at the beginning. In fact, some policies won\u2019t build cash value for the first two to five years.The insurer guarantees that cash value will grow at a minimum rate. However, cash value can grow at a faster rate if the insurer pays dividends.A whole life policyholder has several choices for how to use their cash value. Some options come with hefty fees and may reduce the death benefit, though, and so be sure to get details from your insurer first.Borrow from it: You can take a policy loan against the cash value, but if you haven\u2019t repaid the loan plus interest by the time you die, the death benefit is reduced by the loan balance. Loans from a whole life policy don\u2019t require a credit check, nor will they affect your credit score.Withdraw a portion: Depending on the policy, you may be able to withdraw part of the cash value, though doing so may also reduce your death benefit.Use it to pay premiums: You can use your cash value to offset your premiums. This tends to work well for retirees seeking to maintain coverage on a limited budget.Surrender it: With a cash value surrender, you\u2019re essentially giving up your policy in exchange for your equity, i.e., the cash value. Expect significant fees if you surrender your policy early on \u2014 and at that point your policy may not have accumulated much cash value. However, after 10 or 15 years, cash value surrender fees often go away.Whole life insurance vs. term life insuranceUnlike whole life insurance, term insurance isn\u2019t considered an asset. It doesn\u2019t build cash value or pay dividends. If you survive the term, the policy expires worthless. A typical term life policy offers coverage for no more than 30 years. Though you can usually renew the policy at the end of the term, you can expect higher premiums because your odds of dying increase as you get older.The big advantage of term life insurance is that it\u2019s far more affordable than whole life insurance. Many people don\u2019t need permanent coverage. They need financial protection until their children are grown, their mortgages and other debts are paid off, or they\u2019re retired and no longer collecting a paycheck. Term life insurance is often sufficient in these situations.Policy riders and additional featuresIf you buy a whole life policy, you may also choose to add life insurance riders, which are optional features that typically come at an additional cost. Some common life insurance riders include:Accelerated death benefit rider: Allows you to access part of your policy\u2019s death benefit if you become terminally ill. This feature is also known as a living benefit rider.Critical illness rider: Like an accelerated death benefit rider, but it allows you to access part of your death benefit if you\u2019re diagnosed with a critical illness like cancer that could shorten your life expectancy, even if it doesn\u2019t meet the definition of a terminal illness.Accidental death benefit: Increases the policy\u2019s payout if you die due to an accident.Guaranteed insurability rider: Allows you to buy additional insurance without undergoing another medical exam.Long-term care rider: Provides a monthly benefit to assist with the costs of a skilled nursing facility should you require long-term care.Child rider and spousal rider: These riders offer a small death benefit if your child or spouse dies.Waiver of premium rider: Allows you to stop paying premiums while keeping your policy in force if you become disabled.Tax benefits and considerationsYou can\u2019t take a tax deduction on your premiums on whole life insurance or any type of life insurance. However, death benefits are generally income tax-free for beneficiaries.Whole life insurance offers additional tax advantages. The cash value grows on a tax-deferred basis. Basically, if the money stays in the policy, you won\u2019t pay taxes on the earnings. If you withdraw more than the policy\u2019s cost basis, i.e., the amount you paid in premiums, the earnings will be taxable. But you won\u2019t have any tax liability if you withdraw less than you\u2019ve paid in.Choosing the right coverageYour first step in choosing the right life insurance is to determine how much coverage is necessary. There\u2019s no precise formula for calculating your exact need, but many financial planners recommend replacing at least 10 years of your salary. You may want to aim for an even larger death benefit in some situations, like if you want to pay for your children\u2019s education.You\u2019ll be able to afford a much larger death benefit if you choose term life insurance vs. whole life insurance. But remember: A term policy provides only temporary coverage, while whole life insurance covers you in perpetuity.Also consider your financial goals. A whole life insurance policy may make sense if you want the built-in savings component you get through cash value. Whole life cash value has less growth potential than cash value in a universal life or variable life policy because it\u2019s guaranteed. However, if you\u2019re risk-averse, whole life insurance may feel like a safe, good investment compared to the permanent life insurance alternatives.Finding the best whole life policyTo buy whole life insurance, you\u2019ll probably need to work directly with a life insurance agent, who can help you determine the right amount of coverage for your situation. Few carriers offer online quotes for whole life and other permanent life insurance policies. Once you\u2019ve found a suitable policy, you\u2019ll need to do your homework to find the best life insurance company. Here are some things you\u2019ll want to know before signing an insurance contract:Number of complaints. The National Association of Insurance Commissioner\u2019s complaint index shows you whether a company generates an above-average or below-average number of complaints relative to its size. A company that receives an average number of complaints will receive a score of 1.0, so look for a company that scores below 1.0.The company\u2019s financial strength. Five independent agencies rate the financial health of insurers: A.M. Best, Fitch, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Moody\u2019s, and Standard & Poor\u2019s. Because each has different standards, check the ratings of a whole life insurance company with at least two different agencies.Your budget. Even if you\u2019d prefer the lifetime coverage that whole life insurance offers, the premiums may be prohibitively expensive. Make sure you feel confident that you can afford the payments in the long term.Whole life insurance can get confusing since it\u2019s both an insurance policy and a savings vehicle. Don\u2019t sign a contract unless you\u2019re confident you understand all the details.Most permanent life policies offer something called a life insurance illustration. This document shows you how your policy\u2019s cash value and death benefit will grow over time based on the guaranteed values, as well as the insurer\u2019s projections. Comparing illustrations from several life insurance companies can help you choose the best whole life policy.Conclusion: Is whole life insurance right for you?Whole life insurance coverage may be worth it if you want to leave a guaranteed death benefit to your heirs or a favorite charity. It can also be a good choice if you\u2019re already maxing out your retirement accounts and want another tax-advantaged way to save. But be sure it fits into your long-term financial plans and budget to avoid a policy lapse.","Article Anthor":"Robin Hartill, CFP\u00ae","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 25, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"27":{"Article Title":"Will I be taxed on student loan forgiveness?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/tax-on-student-loan-forgiveness-182343895.html","Article Content":"Since March 13, 2020, federal student loan borrowers haven't had to think much about their student loan payments. The U.S. Department of Education suspended payments, interest was set at 0% and millions of borrowers hoped President Biden's debt relief plan would come to fruition.But payments will resume soon \u2014 and the Biden administration\u2019s student loan debt forgiveness plan is no longer an option thanks to the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling \u2014 so borrowers are taking another look at their debt.As you research available options, one factor is often overlooked: some forms of loan forgiveness are taxable. If you aren't prepared, the taxes on student loan forgiveness can be significant.Do I have to pay income taxes on student loan forgiveness?According to the most recent Federal Student Aid Data Center data, 43.6 million people have outstanding federal student loans. For those struggling to manage their payments, loan forgiveness can seem like a dream come true. But student loan forgiveness tax consequences could lead to surprise bills \u2014 sometimes called the student loan tax bomb \u2014 when borrowers submit their tax returns.The IRS considers canceled debt, including most forms of student loan debt forgiveness or student loan discharge, to be taxable income.However, borrowers working toward loan forgiveness have been exempt from taxes thanks to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. This measure made forgiven student loans exempt from federal income taxes, but it only applies to loans that are discharged between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 20225.The American Rescue Plan applies to all student loan forgiveness programs but only affects federal income taxes. Although some states adopted similar measures for state income taxes, not all followed suit.As of 2023, Indiana, North Carolina, and Mississippi have stated that the balance of forgiven student loans will be taxed as income. Taxpayers in Arkansas, California, and Wisconsin could face the same fate \u2014 the states are currently reviewing their tax laws and have yet to make a determination (as of June 2023).[A previous version of this article stated Minnesota was one of the states to declare that forgiven student loan balances would be taxed as income. In the most recent Minnesota legislative session, lawmakers voted to amend Minn. Stat. \u00a7 290.0132, subd. 24, and \"permanently adopt the American Rescue Plan Act exclusion for discharged student loans...Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022.\"] Student loan forgiveness tax consequences after 2025The American Rescue Act's provisions regarding student loan forgiveness taxes will end on December 31, 2025. From January 1, 2026 onward, how student loan forgiveness and discharge programs are taxed depends on the program.Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)Federal loan borrowers who work for non-profit organizations, government agencies or public service groups may qualify for PSLF if they work for a qualifying employer full-time for 10 years and make 120 qualifying monthly payments. After reaching those milestones, borrowers can apply for debt cancellation. Once approved, the government forgives the remainder of the federal loan balance.PSLF is one of the few programs that is excluded from federal income taxes; none of the forgiven loan amount is taxable as income.Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) DischargeIDR plans are for federal loan borrowers who have trouble affording their payments under the standard 10-year repayment plan. IDR plans extend the loan terms and base the borrower's monthly payments on a percentage of their discretionary income. The four IDR plans are:Income-Based RepaymentIncome-Contingent RepaymentPay As You EarnRevised Pay As You EarnThe government will discharge the remainder if the borrower still has a balance at the end of their loan term. However, the forgiven loans are taxable as income at the federal and state levels.Important: President Biden announced the launch of the new SAVE IDR plan in June 2023. Under the SAVE plan, many borrowers could qualify for lower payments, and qualify for loan forgiveness in as little as 10 years. However, the new plan is being introduced in a phased approach, and all of its benefits won't go into effect until 2024.Borrower Defense to Repayment DischargeBorrower Defense to Repayment Discharge is a program that eliminates federal student loans belonging to borrowers who their college misled, or if their schools engaged in misconduct and violated state laws.The IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have issued notices that clarify that loans discharged through Borrower Defense to Repayment are not taxable as income.Total and Permanent Disability Discharge (TPDD)TPDD applies to borrowers who become totally and permanently disabled. The government will discharge the remaining loan balance for eligible federal loan borrowers.How taxes are handled depends on when you qualify for discharge.If you received discharge before January 1, 2018, the discharged loan amount is subject to federal income taxes. Loans discharged between January 1, 2028, and December 31, 2025, are exempt from federal income taxes. How TPDD will be taxed in 2026 and beyond is not clear at this time.Tax on student loan forgiveness for private student loansPrivate student loans aren't eligible for federal loan programs like PSLF or TPDD. But borrowers with private student loans may qualify for other loan forgiveness or discharge programs. For example, some private lenders will discharge the loans of borrowers who become totally and permanently disabled.The American Rescue Plan specifies that forgiven private student loans are also exempt from federal income taxes through the end of 2025. However, they may be subject to state income taxes.Frequently asked questionsCan I pay down my balance to lower my tax bill?Technically, you can pay down your loan balance to decrease your tax bill if you expect a loan discharge after 2025. But because those taxable programs are based on your income, you may have enough cash to pay down the debt; if you do, there's a chance your payments will go up in the future, decreasing the effectiveness of the forgiveness program.How can I estimate how much I will owe in taxes due to student loan forgiveness?How much you will have to pay in taxes depends on the amount of loan forgiveness you receive and your tax bracket. You can use the American Institute of CPAs marginal tax rate calculator to see how loan forgiveness will impact your tax bill.The tool can give you a ballpark figure of how much you'll owe so you can plan ahead. If you expect a large tax bill, setting aside a little cash every month in a high-yield savings account or CD can help you prepare.If Congress extends the Rescue Plan past 2025, how will that affect borrowers?If Congress extends the American Rescue Plan past 2025, borrowers seeking loan forgiveness through IDR discharge, TPDD, and private loan forgiveness programs would be exempt from federal income taxes. PSLF is never taxed as income, so any extensions wouldn't impact borrowers working toward loan forgiveness through that program.","Article Anthor":"Kat Tretina","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 21, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"28":{"Article Title":"What is the NCUA, and how does it work?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/what-is-ncua-how-does-it-work-101756101.html","Article Content":"The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is a federal agency that oversees credit unions and insures the money people deposit in credit union accounts. In that way, it plays a very similar role to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the agency that insures bank deposits.Like the FDIC, the NCUA insures up to $250,000 per person, per bank, and per ownership category. The term ownership category is a way of describing who owns the account.What is the National Credit Union Administration?The NCUA regulates and insures 98% of credit unions in the United States. That includes all of the federally-chartered credit unions and the vast majority of state-chartered credit unions as well.Congress created the NCUA in 1970 to regulate federal credit unions. A three-member board oversees the agency. Board members are appointed by the president, approved by the Senate, and serve staggered six-year terms. The NCUA, however, isn\u2019t funded by the government but entirely by premiums paid by the credit unions it insures and regulates.To see if the NCUA insures your credit union, look for the NCUA logo on credit union materials or use the NCUA\u2019s search tool.What does the NCUA do?The NCUA provides multiple services for federally chartered credit unions, including:Insuring deposits made at the credit unionProviding licenses, called charters, for credit unions to operateMonitoring credit unions to ensure they follow applicable laws and good practicesThe NCUA is also responsible for managing the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, funded by participating credit unions. Money in this fund repays credit union members\u2019 deposits if a credit union fails.What does NCUA insurance cover?The NCUA insures each credit union account up to $250,000 per person. The NCUA insures the following types of accounts:Savings accountsShare draft (checking) accountsCDsMoney market accountsIndividual retirement accountsFind the best HYSA ratesAlong with the types of accounts that the NCUA insures, there are also different ownership categories:Single accountsJoint accountsSome retirement accountsRevocable trust accountsIrrevocable trust accountsEmployee benefit accountsGenerally, all accounts in the same ownership category at the same credit union count toward the $250,000 insurance limit. Let\u2019s say you have an individual savings account with a $10,000 balance and an individual money market account with a $10,000 balance. In that case, all your money would be insured because the total between the two is less than $250,000. Any money above the $250,000 amount would not be insured and likely would be lost if the credit union failed.You can insure more than $250,000 worth of deposits by spreading your money across credit unions and ownership categories. For example, money in a joint account is not combined with money from an individual account. Each joint account holder is also eligible for $250,000 in insurance. You can use the NCUA\u2019s Share Insurance Estimator tool to determine if your money is insured.Some accounts are not covered by the NCUA, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, municipal securities, life insurance policies, and safety deposit boxes.What happens when a credit union fails?When a credit union fails and is closed, it enters liquidation, and the NCUA takes over its management. During liquidation, another credit union can buy the failed credit union, taking over its members, assets, and loans. In that case, your insured deposits would move to the new credit union. If a failed credit union isn\u2019t bought, you would typically receive your deposit money within five days of the credit union closing.If your money is held in an NCUA-insured credit union, it\u2019s safe as long as you don\u2019t have more than $250,000 in accounts that fall under the same ownership category. If you have more than $250,000 on deposit at a credit union, be sure to read up on NCUA insurance specifics and consider seeking guidance from an employee of the credit union.","Article Anthor":"Kate Rockwood","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 22, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"29":{"Article Title":"How car insurance rates vary by age","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/car-insurance-rates-by-age-193712279.html","Article Content":"Your age is more than just a number when it comes to getting car insurance.To insurers, your age is an indicator of how risky it is to insure you \u2013 essentially, how likely you are to file costly claims. The riskier you\u2019re perceived to be, the more the insurance company will charge you for coverage.In this article, we\u2019ll explain how age impacts car insurance and explore car insurance rates by age.How age affects car insurance ratesWhen you seek out quotes for coverage, auto insurance companies will often ask you for your age or date of birth. This is because most companies use age to determine auto insurance rates.Age group classificationInsurance companies typically categorize drivers into age groups. It may not matter much to your insurance company if you\u2019re 33 vs. 34, but the difference between being 23 vs. 43 will matter because that places you in a different age group.Typical car insurance age brackets are:Teens\/young adults (ages 16-24)Experienced drivers (ages 25-39)Middle-aged drivers (ages 40-64)Senior drivers (ages 65+)Your insurance rates can still vary among others in your same age bracket. Age is far from the only component auto insurers consider when setting rates. However, you\u2019re more likely to see a difference in your car insurance costs as you enter into different age brackets. Insurance companies associate each age bracket with a particular degree of risk.Statistical risk assessmentWith age comes experience and maturity, and that\u2019s often reflected in a person\u2019s driving abilities. Research shows teen drivers are more likely to get into car accidents than more experienced drivers. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death for teens 16 to 19, according to AAA.In addition, elderly drivers have a greater chance of having physical limitations (such as vision loss or cognitive decline) that can negatively impact their driving skills compared to their middle-aged counterparts.Insurance companies consider statistical data regarding age and the likelihood of filing insurance claims when setting car insurance rates, charging higher rates to drivers who are more likely to get into accidents to offset the potential financial loss. Conversely, drivers seen as less risky are generally rewarded with lower auto insurance premiums.Driving record and claims historyAge tends to have a significant influence on your driving record, another key rating factor.When you\u2019re young and don\u2019t have much experience on the road, an insurance company can\u2019t rely on years of past driving history as evidence of whether you\u2019re a bad or good driver.With several years of driving experience under your belt, you get the chance to sharpen your driving skills. You can successfully manage driving on congested highways or in inclement weather. You may qualify for car insurance discounts for being a safe driver and having a record free from any accidents, tickets or insurance claims.If you were involved in car accidents in the past, it\u2019ll take a few years for those incidents to clear from your driving history. After that time has passed, you may qualify for lower insurance premiums, which is another reason some older drivers end up with better insurance rates.Car insurance age bracketsDrivers in the following age brackets often share similar characteristics, including their auto insurance risk factors.Young drivers (16-24)If you\u2019ve noticed that news reports of car accidents often seem to involve young drivers, it\u2019s not a coincidence. Drivers between the ages of 16 and 24 tend to be less experienced on the road and have higher accident rates. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that teen drivers are four times more likely to get into a car crash than drivers 20 and older.As a result, car insurance companies view young drivers as the most risky to insure. Drivers ages 16 to 24 tend to face the highest premiums compared to other age groups.However, young drivers who live with their parents can offset some of their high insurance costs by being added onto their parents\u2019 policy rather than getting insurance on their own \u2013 provided their parents have a good driving history. In addition, teens and young adults in school may be able to qualify for good-student discounts to lower the cost of their insurance premiums.Experienced drivers (25-39)After age 25, auto insurance rates tend to go down as experienced drivers are seen to be more responsible on the road and less likely to cause car accidents or file claims. Experienced drivers who can point to a solid driving history will typically be eligible for lower premiums.Car insurance rates start to stabilize at this point in life. Drivers in this age bracket can enjoy rather consistent auto insurance rates provided there isn\u2019t much change in other factors such as location, credit score or marital status.Middle-aged drivers (40-64)Middle-aged drivers tend to enjoy the lowest car insurance rates. These drivers have had more time improving their driving skills, and likely more time has elapsed since incurring dings on their driving records in their youth.Drivers in this age range also may be more likely to benefit from insurance discounts if they own a home, are married, have good credit or drive safer vehicles.If you\u2019re in this age group, it\u2019s important to note that you could see a spike in your insurance rates if you have a teenage driver or elderly parent living with you. Some insurance companies require all eligible drivers in a household to be listed under your policy, since there\u2019s a chance your teen or elderly parent could wind up getting the keys to your vehicle.Senior drivers (65+)While senior drivers \u2013 ages 65 and up \u2013 aren\u2019t as risky to insure as, say, a 17-year-old, they generally face higher average rates than younger drivers in their 30s, 40s, or 50s.As drivers enter into older age, they have a greater potential of experiencing health conditions \u2013 such as impaired vision or hearing, slower response times and cognitive decline \u2013 that may negatively impact their driving abilities. Certain medications taken by senior drivers can impair driving, and seniors have a greater chance of suffering more severe bodily injury in an accident.According to the Centers for Disease Control, drivers 70 and older have higher automobile fatalities than middle-aged drivers.If you\u2019re a senior driver, you can offset policy increases if you\u2019re retired and no longer drive as much. Without a daily commute to work, you can maintain a low annual mileage on your vehicle, which is seen favorably by insurers.Senior drivers may also be eligible for insurance discounts, such as Nationwide\u2019s defensive driving discount for older drivers.Age milestones and rate changesWhile you might not see much change in your insurance rates with each passing year, you\u2019ll likely notice rate changes as you hit particular age milestones.Young drivers, from ages 16 to 24, often face the highest average costs. Once you\u2019re 25, however, you can typically expect your costs to go down. Progressive, for example, states that rates drop about 9% on average for its customers once they turn 25.Drivers in their 30s, 40s, and 50s typically find themselves enjoying the least expensive car insurance prices of their lifetime \u2013 unless, of course, they have a teenage motorist included on their policy.After age 65, when senior citizens benefit from discounts on other expenses like movie theater tickets and hotel lodging, car insurance rates tend to go up again, but not as high as teen drivers tend to see.Car insurance rates by ageThere is no standard formula to calculate car insurance rates based on age. Rates are individualized, and age is only one of many factors.On top of that, each insurance company evaluates criteria \u2013 such as age, location, driving record, claims history and more \u2013 in its own way to set rates.To give one company\u2019s example, consider this data from Progressive on the average monthly rates of its customers who purchased policies from September 2020 to August 2021.Other criteria impacting car insurance ratesAge is not the only factor that can result in you scoring cheap car insurance \u2014 or paying through the nose.Type of coverage and deductiblesThe amount of coverage you get for your vehicle will affect how much you pay. Carrying only liability insurance could save you money each month, but you\u2019d be on the hook for replacing or fixing your vehicle if you cause an accident, a tree branch breaks your windshield or your car is stolen.Comprehensive insurance and collision insurance that are part of a full coverage policy give you more protection, but you\u2019ll pay more in premiums.If you want to lower your insurance premium, you could elect to pay a higher deductible. Just be prepared to pay that higher amount out of pocket in the event that you\u2019re in an accident.Type of car and vehicle usageThe type of vehicle you drive and how you use it play a major role in determining your car insurance rate. If your vehicle is more expensive to repair or the specific model is often a target for theft, you can expect to pay more for insurance. If your car has top safety and anti-theft features, you might pay less.Also, your car insurance premiums can go up if you put a lot of mileage on the car each year or if you\u2019re using your car for business purposes.LocationWhere you live will have a major influence on your car insurance rates. Florida, for example, has some of the highest rates in the nation, while North Carolina is at the low end.Not only do individual states have their own minimum coverage requirements, but also your specific ZIP code comes with its own level of risk. If you live in a densely populated area with more road congestion and higher crime rates, you\u2019ll likely pay more for car insurance than if you lived in a more rural, safer town.Credit scoreInsurance companies use credit scores to determine car insurance rates due to research that shows a correlation between a person\u2019s credit score and their likelihood to file car insurance claims. Drivers with excellent credit tend to file less claims while those with poor credit tend to file more claims.Gender and marital statusYour gender and your marital status are other factors insurance companies use to determine auto insurance rates. Male drivers \u2013 especially younger ones \u2013 usually pay more for car insurance than female drivers, based on data showing that men are more frequently involved in serious car accidents. Insurance companies typically view married drivers as less risky to insure compared to single drivers and tend to offer them lower rates.Insurance providersEach insurance provider has its own underwriting process and methodology for evaluating your level of risk. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get auto insurance quotes from multiple companies. Even if you are already insured with one company, you might want to check rates from competitors once a year to make sure you\u2019re getting the best car insurance for the best rate.Frequently asked questionsAge is one of the many factors that has significance when it comes to car insurance rates. Here are the answers to some common questions surrounding age and car insurance rates.Why is age a factor for car insurance rates?Studies have shown that certain age groups are more prone to being involved in car accidents and filing auto insurance claims. To mitigate potential financial losses, most car insurance companies charge higher premiums for those high-risk age groups.What age group has the most expensive car insurance?Young drivers ages 16 to 24 tend to have the most expensive car insurance. Drivers in this age group are often inexperienced and are more likely to get into car accidents and file insurance claims. As a result, car insurance companies often charge higher premiums to young drivers.Why does car insurance go down after 25?Drivers 25 and older are typically viewed as having better driving skills due to more experience on the road. Speeding tickets, DUIs, or car accidents from earlier years disappear from driving records with time, so drivers over 25 with clean driving records should see an improvement in their average cost of car insurance.What age group has the cheapest car insurance?Experienced and middle-aged drivers in their 30s, 40s, and 50s often have the cheapest car insurance of all age groups. These drivers have more experience on the road and tend to be better drivers. They\u2019re less likely to cause accidents and file insurance claims, so they\u2019re viewed as less risky to insure. However, if drivers in this age range have teenage children or an elderly parent living in their household, their car insurance rates could go up.Is it cheaper for teens to get their own insurance or be on their parents\u2019 policy?While having a teenage driver on a parent\u2019s car insurance policy will cause that policy to be more expensive, it\u2019s still usually less expensive than if that teen were to get insurance on their own. With a combined policy, the family can ideally benefit from the parent\u2019s good driving history, credit score and being in a less risky age group.","Article Anthor":"Nicole Dow","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 22, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"30":{"Article Title":"Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could help","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/when-do-student-loans-resume-203115948.html","Article Content":"luplupme via Getty ImagesBorrowers with federal student loans haven't had to make payments or worry about accrued interest since March 2020. On top of that, millions of Americans thought their student loans would be eliminated through President Joe Biden's one-time student loan forgiveness program.However, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's plan, ending the hopes of student loan debt relief for many. Congress also passed a law preventing any federal loan payment freeze extensions, so the payment pause will end in October.The Biden administration acted quickly and announced new measures that could help borrowers struggling with their payments. Taking advantage of these programs could help you reduce your payments, get your loans in good standing, and avoid student loan default.News for borrowers with federal student loansWhen do student loans resume? It's a common question, and the answer has changed several times. Initially, the loan payment freeze on federal student loans was planned to last for only a few months. But then-President Trump \u2014 and later, President Biden \u2014 repeatedly extended the freeze. As a result, many borrowers haven't made payments toward their federal loans in over three years.Now, payments are set to resume. According to the US Department of Education, interest will start to accrue on Sept. 1, 2023, and payments will begin in October 2023.To make student loan repayment more manageable, the Biden administration launched three key initiatives:12-month on-ramp to repayment for federal student loansTypically, borrowers who fail to make on-time payments face steep consequences, including:The negative activity is reported to the credit bureaus and noted on your credit history.The account can be sent to collections.If the loan enters default, the government can garnish your wages.However, the government created a temporary \"on-ramp\" period. It gives borrowers 12 months to come up with a plan for managing their loans without worrying about missed or partial payments being reported to the credit bureaus or sent to collections agencies or the loans entering default.Student loan interest will continue to accrue during this time, so paying the minimum required \u2014 or as much as you can afford \u2014 will help you avoid added interest charges. But the on-ramp period gives you time to adjust to student loan payments resuming without the severe consequences that usually come with late or missed payments.Fresh Start program for borrowers in defaultThe Fresh Start program is a new initiative from the Biden administration for borrowers with student loan debt who were in default before the March 13, 2020, payment freeze. Under this program, the government is eliminating the negative impact of student loan default for those borrowers, allowing them to enter repayment like other borrowers so they can start their repayment with a fresh slate.The Fresh Start program will last for one year after the end of the federal payment freeze, and it provides borrowers with the following benefits:Restores access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plansReestablishes eligibility to federal student aid programs like Pell GrantsProtects borrowers from collections activity and negative credit reportingGives borrowers the option of qualifying for student loan rehabilitation if they default later onThe program is not automatic; to take advantage of the Fresh Start initiative, borrowers must take the following steps:Reach out to the loan holder: Borrowers must contact their loan holder and state that they want to take advantage of the program. You can start by\u00a0visiting myeddebt.ed.gov or calling 1-800-621-3115.The government removes your default status: After making arrangements, your loans will be transferred to a non-default loan servicer, and the US Department of Education will remove the default status from the borrower\u2019s credit reports.Sign up for a new payment plan: Once you're out of default, you can sign up for another payment plan. The majority of borrowers sign up for one of the income-driven repayment plans that base their payments on a percentage of their discretionary income and an extended repayment term.Not all borrowers are eligible for the Fresh Start program. Only federal student loan borrowers with the following defaulted loan types will qualify:Direct loans, including Federal Stafford loans, Direct Consolidation loans, and PLUS loans offered via the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program (TEACH Grants converted to Direct Unsubsidized Loans are also eligible).Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL) loans, including Federal Stafford loans, Federal Consolidation loans, and Federal PLUS loans.Federal Perkins loans held by the US Department of Education.Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Academic Competitiveness Grants, National SMART Grants, and TEACH Grants. (Note: you may have to repay part of a federal grant awarded to you.)Other loans, including private student loans and privately held FFEL or Perkins loans, are ineligible. You can use the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) if you\u2019ve defaulted on your student loan and are unsure of your loan type. If the loan or grant is not one of the program types listed above and is not assigned to the US Department of Education, the information on the NSLDS site does not apply to you.The Fresh Start initiative is a one-time program; you cannot take advantage of it again. And if you default later, the government will report the date of your initial delinquency to the credit bureaus.SAVE repayment planIn 2023, the Biden administration announced the launch of a new IDR plan, the SAVE repayment plan. For low- to middle-income borrowers, the SAVE plan could significantly reduce their payments. It provides several benefits. Some won't go into effect until 2024, but these three perks will begin this summer:It increases the amount of sheltered incomeWith all IDR plans, including the new SAVE plan, your payments are based on a percentage of your discretionary income. Currently, the other IDR plans define discretionary income as the difference between your actual income and 150% of the federal poverty guideline for your family size. But the SAVE plan adjusts the definition of discretionary income to the difference between your income and 225% of the federal poverty guideline.For example, let's say you live in New York, are single, and earn $30,000 per year. The federal poverty guideline for a household of one is $14,580. The current IDR plans use 150% of the poverty guideline to determine your payments, so you would subtract $21,870 from your salary of $30,000 to find your discretionary income. In this scenario, your discretionary income is $8,130. Under the current IDR plans, payments cannot exceed 10% of your discretionary income, so your payments would total $813 per year or $67.75 per month.Under the SAVE plan, discretionary income is defined as the difference between your salary and 225% of the federal poverty guideline. In this scenario, 225% of the federal poverty guideline for your family size is $32,805. Because your income is less than that, you have no discretionary income and would have $0 monthly payments. That means you won't have to pay anything toward your loans, but you won't enter default. And if you still have a balance at the end of your loan term, the remainder is forgiven.The SAVE plan eliminates 100% of unpaid interest on subsidized and unsubsidized loansAs long as you make your payments on time, the government waives unpaid interest, so your loan balance won't grow over time. For example, if your loan accrues $50 per month in interest but your monthly payment is just $30, the government will waive the remaining $20.Spousal income may be excludedWith some IDR plans, your spouse's income is included in the payment calculations, even if you file separate returns. But with SAVE, your spouse's income is excluded if you're married and file separately.What to do to prepare for when student loan repayments resumePayments are set to resume in October. To prepare, follow these steps:Create a budgetIf you haven't made payments toward your loans in years, your finances have likely changed quite a bit. Sit down and create a budget, outlining how much money you have coming in and going out every month. If your budget is too tight, look for areas where you can cut back or consider other repayment options for your student loans.Find your student loan servicerYour loans have likely changed loan servicers since 2020. And if the previous loan servicer didn't have your current address, you may not have received a notification. To find out where your loans are held \u2014 and to set up your payments to avoid late fees \u2014 you can sign in with the Federal Student Aid account dashboard or you can call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-433-3243.Once you know who your servicer is, you can create an online account or contact customer support to change repayment plans or set up your monthly payments.Enroll in the Fresh Start programIf you plan on taking advantage of the Fresh Start program, contact your loan holder at myeddebt.ed.gov or call 1-800-621-3115.Enroll in a new repayment planOn your loan servicer\u2019s account dashboard, you can see what your minimum payment will be when payments resume in October 2023. If your payment under the current repayment plan is too high, you may be able to enroll in a new repayment plan, such as the new SAVE plan, to reduce your payments.You can use the loan simulator tool to determine which plan gives you the lowest payments.Apply for deferment or forbearanceIf you are unable to make payments due to illness or unemployment, you may be able to postpone your payments under a federal forbearance or deferment program. Contact your loan servicer and explain your circumstances to find out what options are available.Sign up for autopaySigning up for automatic payments ensures you never miss a payment, but there is an added benefit: Federal loan servicers will also reduce your interest rate by 0.25%. Over time, that rate reduction can help you save money.Make additional payments (if you can)Not everyone will qualify for low monthly payments under an IDR plan. If you have to make payments under a standard 10-year repayment plan and want to get rid of your debt as quickly as possible, making extra payments is key.For example, let's say you have $15,000 in student loans at 5% interest. With a 10-year repayment term, your monthly payment is $159 per month. If you increased your payments to $179 per month \u2014 adding an extra $20 to your monthly payments \u2014 you would pay off your loans 16 months early and save over $600.Here is how much additional payments would affect your overall loan cost:FAQsWill student loan payments resume?Federal student loans will start accruing interest on Sept. 1, 2023, and your payments will resume in October 2023.Are private student loans eligible for the new repayment plans or the Fresh Start program?No, private student loans aren't eligible for the Fresh Start initiative, SAVE repayment plan, or other federal benefits. If you have trouble affording the payments on a private student loan, contact your lender to see if an alternative payment plan is available.Will I be able to have my student loans forgiven?Although the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's debt relief plan, federal loan borrowers may be eligible for other forms of loan forgiveness. For example, those who work for nonprofit organizations may qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and some teachers may qualify for Teacher Loan Forgiveness. You can view all loan forgiveness and discharge programs on studentaid.gov.How do I apply for the new SAVE repayment plan?The Save Plan doesn't have a separate application yet. However, borrowers can still take advantage of it. If you are currently on the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan, you will automatically be enrolled in SAVE. If you are on a different plan, you can sign up for REPAYE online, and you will be enrolled in SAVE.","Article Anthor":"Kat Tretina","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 21, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"31":{"Article Title":"What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/what-the-fed-rate-hike-pause-means-for-bank-accounts-cds-loans-and-credit-cards-183027625.html","Article Content":"The Federal Reserve's decision on Sept. 20, 2023, to pause rate hikes will give savers and borrowers a break from rising interest rates \u2014 but lower rates are not on the Fed's radar anytime soon.After 11 rate hikes in 16 months, the central bank appears willing to let interest rates simmer for a while but not rule out further increases in the month ahead.The Fed controls one interest rate: the federal funds rate, which is the short-term rate banks use to borrow from each other. Fed interest rate decisions filter through the financial world, impacting virtually every facet of borrowing costs and saving rates.Interest rate management is monetary medicine the Fed uses to:Slow the economy by raising interest rates in an effort to tame rising costs (high inflation) as measured by the Consumer Price Index.Help mount a recovery when we're at the opposite end of an economic cycle by lowering interest rates as an injection of liquidity into the financial system.Allow past moves to take root while the Fed considers future actions by holding rates steady.What the Fed says is ahead for interest ratesIn a statement issued following the announcement of a pause in rate hikes, the Fed said, \"Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed in recent months but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low.\"That sounds like good news, but in a monetary policy world, it's not. A strong economy can fuel higher consumer prices and the Fed says \"inflation remains elevated.\"Holding interest rates at a high level is an effort to tamp down inflation.\"Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,\" the Fed added.Here\u2019s how the Fed\u2019s actions could trickle down to your loans and accounts.How a rate-hike pause affects checking and savings accountsYour short-term liquidity depends on money in the bank. For years, that has meant Americans treading water as cash earned next to nothing. As interest rates have risen, so have deposit account rates. The pause in interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve will likely keep deposit account rates near their current level.Checking accountsChecking accounts that pay interest offer the most meager returns. But you need quick access to the money, and if you manage your cash flow, the bank won't have most of that money in its hands for long.Interest-earning checking accounts paid a national average of 0.04% monthly in September 2022. A year later, that rate had risen to 0.07%. On a scale of \"not much interest\" measured in basis points, that's from a smidge to a tad.Let's move up the interest-paid-for-cash scale.Savings accountsShort to mid-term money is best parked in a savings account. It's part of your easy-in, easy-out cash strategy. Last year, in September, the monthly average interest rate on a traditional savings account at a brick-and-mortar bank was 0.17%. In September 2023 it\u2019s 0.45%.High-yield savings accounts pay more \u2014 Yahoo Finance is seeing high-yield savings account APYs of 5% or more. (APY is the result of compounding your interest rate. Compounding periods can vary by bank.) Rates are pushing ever closer to 6% \u2014 a great reason to open an account.Money market accountsA money market account often boosts your return from a common checking account, but you'll likely need to deposit anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 to earn the raise.Last September's national average monthly interest rate was 0.18%. One year later, it's 0.65%. In a decimal world, that's a pretty big jump. And remember, that's an average. Consider putting your second layer of cash in an above-average money market account. It's the money you want close at hand, but not checking-account close.To do that, look for a high-yield money market account. As the Federal Reserve holds interest rates where they are, high-yield money market accounts will remain elevated. Again, Yahoo Finance is seeing high-yield interest rates at and slightly over 5%.What to do now: Shop rates at banks, both brick-and-mortar and online. Keep your near-term cash nimble and earning the best rate it can. Any future Fed rate hike should be a reminder to keep your eye out for improving deposit rates.What Fed policy does for CDsThis year has brought good news for CDs. As the Fed pushed rates up, certificates of deposit earned more.A 12-month CD was earning 0.60% monthly interest in September 2022. A bucket of rate hikes later, the same term CD was paying 1.76%. The best CDs are already topping 5% APY. Your minimum deposit and term will determine your rate.Consider a CD ladder to surf the rising wave of interest rates.What to do now: Use CDs to earn interest on your mid-term money. Staggering maturities, with the ladder strategy mentioned above, will allow you the flexibility to benefit from higher interest rates and access your money without locking it all up for years.What the latest Federal Reserve move will mean for loans and mortgagesNow to the other side of the asset\/liability ledger. Higher interest rates influenced by the Federal Reserve's tightening of the money supply mean you pay lenders more to borrow.Personal loansInterest rates on personal loans have risen from 9.39% at the beginning of the Fed rate hikes in March of 2022 to 11.48% in May 2023. That higher trend is expected to continue until monetary policy officials believe the fight against inflation is won.Student loansWith forbearance ending and payments becoming due again, student loans are rising top-of-mind again for those who still owe. Most federal loans have fixed interest rates, so Fed policy doesn't impact them. Private student loans may have a variable rate, and Fed rate hikes can be a factor.To learn the interest rate on an existing loan, contact your lender or loan servicer.The latest plan from the Biden administration, SAVE IDR, could allow lower payments to those who qualify as the program rolls out. Over 800,000 borrowers are being notified of loan forgiveness related to income-driven repayment plans.Meanwhile, interest rates on new student loans are rising.Home mortgage loansIf you've been looking to buy a home in the past two years, you know this story. Home loan rates have soared. When the Fed hikes began, lenders were pricing 30-year fixed-rate mortgages around 4%, according to Freddie Mac. After peaking at 7% last October, home loan interest rates eased slightly but have bubbled back up.The Fed doesn't directly influence current mortgage rates, they're a function of lenders tracking financial markets. However, if high inflation continues to ease, it's likely that home loan rates will soon follow. It won't be a diamond run descent. It took nearly 20 years for mortgage loan rates to fall from 7% in 2001 to an annual percentage rate under 3% in 2020. And homebuyers may not see lenders price home loan rates that low again anytime soon. The 50-year average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is well over 7%.What to do now: Carefully consider taking on any additional debt as interest rates remain elevated. If you do initiate a new loan, budget your monthly payment for rates to remain mostly stable. Then if interest rates do head lower and you get a refinancing opportunity, it will be a welcome budget surprise.How Fed rate hikes impact credit cardsWhile the Fed's fight against inflation may be easing the rise in consumer prices, the central bank's past rate increases have impacted your credit card debt, too \u2013 and not in a good way.Credit card interest rates have moved from an average of 16.65% to well over 22% during the Federal Reserve's latest rate-raising cycle. No doubt, those variable APR interest rate charges on credit cards will remain high as long as the monetary policy holds firm.That means minimum payments due won't ease and stiff interest charges on credit card balances will remain unless you pay off your cards each billing cycle.What to do now: Prioritize paying off the credit cards you can \u2014 especially those with the highest interest charges \u2014 and consider balance transfers to lower interest rate and zero-interest credit card offers as your credit score allows. With good credit, a personal loan for credit card debt consolidation may be another option to consider.","Article Anthor":"Hal Bundrick","Article Date":"Wed, Sep 20, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"32":{"Article Title":"Do I need emergency roadside assistance coverage?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/emergency-roadside-assistance-174215567.html","Article Content":"Whether it\u2019s a flat tire or an empty gas tank, being stranded on the side of the road is stressful. And when you\u2019re in an unfamiliar location, having help on speed dial can be a serious relief.When you pay for roadside assistance, you get a dedicated service provider who will ride to the rescue whether a dead battery needs a jump start or a disabled vehicle requires a tow. Let\u2019s take a closer look at what emergency roadside service plans offer drivers and whether this coverage is the right fit for you and your vehicle.What is emergency roadside assistance?Emergency road service is a popular coverage option that helps stranded motorists who are having mechanical issues. Most roadside assistance services offer 24\/7 coverage from a network of local service providers at a reduced cost.A roadside assistance plan can include towing services, help with flat tires, fuel delivery, battery replacement and even locksmith services. Note that what\u2019s covered can vary depending on the location, provider, and several other factors.Emergency road service is designed to minimize the costs of common sources of car malfunction and provide support even in a remote or rural breakdown location.What does emergency roadside assistance cover?Roadside services are designed to save you money in the event your vehicle breaks down, but the benefits included in roadside assistance programs can vary significantly. Here are a few (but not all) of the things you\u2019ll find roadside assistance covers.Towing servicesWhen your car breaks, doing mechanical labor in the breakdown lane isn\u2019t always an option. A roadside assistance program includes towing to the nearest repair facility for free or at a reduced cost. This can also include emergency services and a winch when your vehicle is stuck.Battery servicesGot a dead battery or need a jump start? Roadside assistance services ride to the rescue and replace the battery if needed at a competitive price. Some roadside assistance plans will also test your battery, starter and alternator as well as haul away your old one for free.Tire change servicesIf your road trip has suddenly ground to a halt, roadside assistance plans provide assistance changing a flat tire. Just keep in mind there are some common sense limits to this service such as having your own spare tire on hand.Fuel deliveryYou really thought you\u2019d make it to the gas station, but your fuel tank had other plans. Fuel delivery is often part of roadside assistance coverage but beware that they\u2019ll only top you off enough to make it to the nearest station.Locksmith servicesIf you\u2019re the owner of older vehicles, chances are you\u2019ve locked your keys in the car at least once. Locksmith service can be the key to getting your car rolling again and if they can\u2019t break into your vehicle, they\u2019ll often call you a tow truck.Minor repair and labor coverageIf the problem sidelining you in the breakdown lane is a quick fix like loose wires or low fluids, some roadside services step up to solve the issue. More complicated repairs might not be within your coverage limits.Some roadside programs also cover a few different kinds of vehicles, from motorcycles to boats and RVs. And you can opt for add-on coverage like trip interruption benefits, which would reimburse for the cost of food or lodging if you\u2019re stranded far from home while waiting on a repair shop.Who needs roadside assistance services?Many drivers rack up plenty of mileage (and DIY repairs) without the assistance of an emergency roadside service. But according to I Drive Safely, a defensive driving program, there are some situations where having emergency support is a smart idea.If you own an old car.Did you know according to Car and Driver that the average age of vehicles on the road is 11 years old? A study from AAA indicates any car old enough to sport double digits is twice as likely to end up sidelined on the highway during the next family road trip.If you have a long commute.More mileage equals more chances for things to go wrong with your car. The US Census Bureau indicates the average one-way commute increased to 27.6 minutes in 2019. That puts just over 7,000 miles on your vehicle annually.If you\u2019re worried about your ability to change a tire or make minor repairs.Imagine yourself on the side of a busy highway or on a remote country road after dark. How confident are you in your ability to change a flat tire quickly and safely? Not so confident? Roadside assistance might give you peace of mind.If you\u2019re taking a long road trip.Hitting the highway for an epic road trip gets a lot less fun when you\u2019re stranded or out of gas. Consider roadside assistance coverage for longer trips, especially those to rural or remote areas where finding an auto repair provider in an emergency might be a serious (and expensive) hassle.How much does roadside assistance cost?One of the important considerations before plunking down your money for a roadside assistance plan is the cost. Is roadside service worth it?Let\u2019s take a closer look at what you might pay for common issues with your vehicle if you have roadside coverage versus without it.Keep in mind that additional costs of fuel, tires, and batteries are not included in either estimate. And that in the case of towing without roadside assistance, you\u2019ll pay additional costs per mile on top of the towing fee. Costs can vary for roadside programs as well based on your coverage limits and location.As you can see from the cost comparison, even if you only experience one of these common car problems per year, you\u2019ll save money with emergency road service coverage.5 benefits of having emergency roadside serviceYou\u2019ve heard the cliche: membership has its benefits. Here are a few reasons to lean into the extra costs associated with roadside coverage.1. 24\/7 supportThere\u2019s a certain peace of mind that comes with knowing you\u2019re not alone when you\u2019re stranded at 2 a.m. Roadside assistance programs have folks manning the helm round the clock so that when you call for help, they\u2019ll answer.2. Real-time trackingIn the same way you can track your pizza from the moment it gets popped into the oven until the delivery driver arrives, many roadside assistance mobile apps offer real-time tracking of providers like tow truck drivers.3. Quick and reliable assistanceMany emergency roadside service providers promise help will arrive within a certain time frame (like 30 minutes or less) depending on location. This can be a relief if you\u2019re sitting in your car with the whole family and feeling anxious about getting to your destination.4. Widespread coverageWhile there\u2019s no guarantee your roadside program covers every corner of the map, many of them have contracted providers just a few miles away on major routes and highways.5. Peace of mindWhen you get behind the wheel, you never plan to have a breakdown. But accidents happen and if you\u2019re not equipped to handle minor repairs, it can be a relief to let the professionals handle it.Choosing an emergency road service providerWhen you think of emergency roadside assistance, you likely associate it with being a AAA member. While AAA service is one of the most popular options, there are other ways to request roadside assistance coverage.Below are just a few options to consider, but keep in mind you may already have some limited coverage through your car insurance, credit card or even cell phone provider.American Automobile Association (AAA) MembershipThe long-standing auto club offers three tiers of annual plans: Classic, PlusRV, and Premier.

Credit card balances and the interest rates they carry are no exception.With another federal interest rate decision due, it can be helpful to understand just how the central bank\u2019s movements affect your high-interest card balances. Here\u2019s what to know.How the Fed affects credit card interest ratesThe Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. It sets monetary policy partially by adjusting the federal funds target rate range. Since March 2022, the Fed has increased this range several times, aiming to bring down high inflation rates.But what does this have to do with your credit cards? The target range set by the Fed doesn\u2019t directly change your credit card APR or annual percentage rate. But it does play a role alongside a third interest rate called the prime rate.Here\u2019s a breakdown of how the process works:Federal funds rate: This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans. The Fed sets a target range for this rate at FOMC meetings.Prime rate: A benchmark rate for lending products offered by banks. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set the prime rate, but it is based on (and tends to move alongside) the federal funds rate.Credit card interest rates: Lenders determine a variable rate range for credit cards using the prime rate plus and added margin. Your interest rate will fall within this range based on various factors (like credit score) as determined by your credit card issuer.The Fed sets a target federal funds rate range, which banks use to determine their prime rate. Issuers then add percentage points on top of the prime rate to determine your credit card\u2019s rate range.How high your APR ultimately moves within this range is based on several other factors, like your credit score, individual credit history, and other details in your application.Why credit card interest rates are risingAs the Fed rate increases, the prime rate goes up, which means the interest rates on your existing and new credit cards likely will, too. There is an exception: If you lock in an introductory 0% APR on a new card, that offer will remain even if the regular, ongoing APR rises.Credit cards carry variable APRs that change with the prime rate, which is a big reason why Fed interest rate hikes can affect interest even on cards you already have.The central bank has increased its federal funds target rate range by several hundred basis points since March 2022, to more than 5%. In that time, the APRs set by credit card issuers have also increased.These rates were relatively stable between 14%-16% for the past few years, according to Fed data. But since 2022, averages have skyrocketed to more than 20% APR. For accounts that revolve debt balances, the average is even higher: around 22%.How higher interest rates make credit card debt more expensiveInterest rates are higher for all types of lending products \u2014 mortgages, car loans, personal loans, business loans, and so on. On top of that, stubborn inflation means prices for groceries and other essentials are still high. Housing costs are also high, and millions of student loan borrowers will soon add another monthly payment for millions of borrowers.At the same time, Americans are increasing the amount of high-interest credit they owe.In August, credit card debt balances exceeded $1 trillion, according to the Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit from the New York Fed, the highest level the survey has recorded. At the same time, credit card delinquencies are also rising, with more than 5% of card accounts in \u201cserious delinquency\u201d of 90 days or more.What happens to credit card debt when interest rates go up?A higher credit card APR can result in you paying more \u2014 and longer \u2014 toward your debt.Record-high balances coupled with record-high interest rates mean many Americans are already paying more toward their credit cards today. Over time, interest charges can compound quickly as rates rise, leaving cardholders in debt for longer.3 ways you can prepare for Fed rate hikesEven if there is a slowdown of interest rate hikes ahead, it'll be a long while before we\u2019ll see any cuts.\u201cAlthough inflation has moved down from its peak \u2014 a welcome development \u2014 it remains too high,\u201d Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in an August speech. \u201cWe are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.\u201dNo matter what the future brings for interest rate changes, there are ways you can reduce the effects of higher APRs on your personal finances.1. Pay more than your minimum paymentMaking more than the minimum payment required each billing cycle can help you pay down balances faster. Pay off your balances in full and on time whenever possible to avoid debt altogether and maintain good credit.2. Consider a balance transfer credit cardIf you already have credit card debt, a 0% APR offer on balance transfers could help you reduce your debt. When you make a balance transfer, you can pay down your existing balances without interest over a period typically lasting around 12-21 months (after paying a balance transfer fee). Your remaining balance will accrue interest at the ongoing variable APR when the offer ends.3. Research 0% APR credit cardsSome credit cards carry intro APRs on both new purchases and balance transfers. If you\u2019re considering opening a new credit card, securing a lower interest rate for several months could help you avoid rising APRs for a while or pay off a larger purchase interest-free over the period.If you\u2019re thinking about applying for a new card with a 0% APR offer, make sure you compare your options before applying. The \u201cbest credit card\u201d for you depends on your individual situation, so it\u2019s important to consider all the details and how the card may fit your longer-term financial goals.Remember: The best way to avoid interest is to pay your balances in full. No matter which card you choose, charging only what you can afford to pay off is the best way to keep rising rates from affecting your wallet.Editorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at how much full windshield replacement costs, whether your insurance covers glass damage, and how to make an insurance claim for a cracked windshield.How much does it cost to replace a damaged windshield?If you don\u2019t have comprehensive or collision coverage, you might pay a pretty penny to replace your vehicle\u2019s glass. That\u2019s because advances in motor vehicle technology mean your windshield replacement could require recalibration of expensive safety features.According to the Insurance Journal, the average windshield replacement claim is about $400. However, Kelley Blue Book indicates that on vehicles equipped with wiper sensors or advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as automatic braking, replacing a windshield can cost $1,000 or more.Does car insurance cover windshield damage or replacement?There are several scenarios where auto insurance companies will cover the cost to repair or replace your windshield.Yes, if you have comprehensive and collision coverage.Whether your windshield breaks in an at-fault accident or the glass damage happens as a result of some other kind of accident or vandalism, your car insurance policy\u2019s comprehensive or collision coverage covers windshield replacement.The comprehensive portion of your policy covers glass claims that are the result of things like a broken tree branch or road debris. Broken glass repair costs from car accidents would be covered by collision insurance.Read more: How comprehensive car insurance works and what it coversYes, if someone else damaged your windshield in an at-fault accident.If your windshield was damaged in an accident where the other driver was at fault, their liability insurance should pay for a windshield claim. And if you have underinsured motorist liability coverage, windshield claims should also be covered even if the person at fault doesn\u2019t have proper coverage.Homeowners or renters insurance may also cover windshield claims if the car\u2019s windshield was broken on someone else\u2019s property as result of negligence or an accident such as a batter earning a strike when they send that baseball soaring through your car\u2019s glass.Yes, if you have full glass coverage.Even if you don\u2019t have an auto insurance policy with comprehensive and collision coverage, you can get full auto glass insurance as an add-on insurance product.Getting glass coverage that covers windshield replacement in full may be a good idea if you live in a state that has severe weather or a lot of road debris, drive a vehicle off-road frequently, or your original windshield is 8-10 years old.Windshield repair vs. windshield replacementRepairing a windshield is much less expensive and time-consuming than replacing one. While you\u2019ll pay hundreds to completely replace your vehicle\u2019s windshield, most glass shops offer repair services starting at as little as $20 depending on the extent of the repair and the make and model of your vehicle.How do you know if your cracked or chipped windshield can be repaired versus replaced? The following are a few guidelines used to determine whether that rock chip that turned into a crack is a good candidate for a cheap fix.Each state is a little different, but in general most state laws mandate that your windshield can\u2019t pose a safety risk. For example, in South Carolina windshield cracks are not explicitly mentioned but the law states vehicles cannot be operated if the driver's view is obstructed in any way.Auto glass specialists also emphasize that it's crucial to get cracks and chips fixed as soon as possible to avoid further damage to the windshield. Fortunately, the glass repair process usually only takes about 30 minutes and while you might still see a small blemish on the glass, the structural integrity of the windshield should remain intact.How does a glass deductible for car insurance work?One significant caveat to whether or not you\u2019ll have to pay out of pocket for new vehicle glass is if the windshield claim is subject to a collision or comprehensive deductible. Most insurance companies require you to meet the deductible before they pay out for comprehensive claims for physical damage or a collision claim. Windshield claims are no exception.Read more: What you need to know about car insurance deductiblesWhat does this mean for your wallet? Let\u2019s say you have a $250 insurance deductible and replacing your windshield will cost $450. That means you\u2019d have to pay the first $250 and then your insurance would pay the rest through a comprehensive claim process. However, if your deductible is $500, you\u2019d end up paying the entire cost out of pocket unless you have optional coverage for full glass replacement.There are some states, such as Florida, Kentucky, and South Carolina, where you can get your deductible waived or where having to meet windshield deductibles before coverage kicks in is prohibited. In other states like New York, Connecticut, and Minnesota, you can add windshield insurance coverage that\u2019s not subject to a deductible.If the windshield only needs repair, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners says to contact your insurance agent to see if your coverage waives the comprehensive or collision deductible for glass repairs.How is full auto glass insurance coverage different from comprehensive coverage?Full glass coverage is optional coverage you can add, usually for just a few dollars per month on your insurance premium. Because it\u2019s designed to cover the cost of a windshield replacement or repair, it\u2019s sometimes referred to as windshield insurance or windshield repair insurance.Comprehensive and collision coverage automatically include glass coverage, but you\u2019ll have to meet your deductible before any claims will be paid. The Insurance Information Institute advises that states that don\u2019t automatically include glass coverage in comprehensive insurance coverage will often offer the coverage as an add-on option.Your 6-step guide to filing a claim for windshield replacementGot a crack in your windshield that\u2019s spidering into a web? Explore your options for windshield replacement or repair before the damage gets ahead of you.1. Understand what your insurance coverage includes.Before you rush to file a claim online, understanding what your insurance covers is a good first step. Whether your car insurance will cover a windshield repair or replacement depends on several factors such as if the damage occurred as a result of an accident, your state\u2019s laws and the amount of your deductible.2. Determine \u2014 promptly \u2014 if your vehicle needs windshield replacement or repair.Many of the minor dings and dents windshields pick up as a result of daily driving are simple and inexpensive repairs. But larger cracks and punctures are a different story. And bear in mind that waiting too long to address a problem can end up compromising the structural integrity of the glass or causing a complete collapse of the windshield.3. Make sure your glass claim isn't covered under someone else\u2019s insurance.If the windshield damage occurred as a result of an accident that was determined to be the other driver\u2019s fault, their car insurance should cover repairs such as glass replacement. Glass damage from falling debris or objects that occurred in a driveway might also be covered under a homeowner\u2019s or renter\u2019s insurance policy.4. Call your insurance company to confirm your comprehensive insurance deductible.Once you\u2019ve assessed the extent of the damage and whether or not it\u2019s covered by insurance, you\u2019ll need to determine if filing a claim is actually worth it. Call your insurance company to get a clear idea of what your comprehensive or collision deductible is and how it will be applied toward your windshield repair or replacement.5. Get quotes from auto glass repair shops that work with your auto insurance company.It pays to shop around for quotes for most consumers, and glass repair is no exception. Make sure you know which glass repair shops work directly with your insurance and ask if they offer any discounts for working directly with your insurer on glass claims.6. File a claim or get reimbursed through the glass claim processIf you do plan to use your insurance to cover the cost of a windshield repair or replacement, you\u2019ll have to file a claim or work with a glass shop that will file one for you. Be clear about expectations for out-of-pocket costs and if you choose an out of network provider, contact your insurance company to clarify how you\u2019ll be reimbursed.","Article Anthor":"Kaz Weida","Article Date":"Tue, Sep 19, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"35":{"Article Title":"Mortgage rates at 20-year high: Is 2023 a good time to buy a house?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/is-it-a-good-time-to-buy-a-house-202100449.html","Article Content":"Malte Mueller via Getty ImagesWhen the housing market was searing hot, buyers faced intense competition \u2014 bidding wars, cash investors, and buy\/sell decisions made on rapid deadlines. Now that real estate has cooled, there are fewer homes for sale, two-decade-high interest rates, and stubbornly elevated house values.It's rarely easy to buy a home. And if you can find a house you love, the question becomes: Is now a good time to buy?The 2023 housing marketLooking for the perfect time to buy? Fewer than one in five consumers surveyed by Fannie Mae in July 2023 thought that it was a good time to buy a home. Yet, timing the housing market is more complicated than timing the stock market. Which is impossible. There are few \"just right\" Goldilocks real estate markets.But you're not buying the market. You're buying a house in a city, neighborhood, and block where you want to live. Hopefully, for quite a while.Mortgage ratesWe all know this story. Interest rates have risen \u2014 and mortgage rates are no exception. The Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates for well over a year in an effort to shrink inflation \u2014 the rise in consumer prices. Not only do the Fed's rate increases immediately lift short-term mortgage rates such as variable-rate loans, but they also tend to influence long-term mortgage rates upwards as well eventually.And though we don't live in a 2%-3% world these days, mortgage rates are near their 52-year historical average.Since April 1971, the 30-year mortgage rate has averaged 7.74%, based on data collected by Freddie Mac.Of course, that's little comfort to homebuyers today who remember when rates were under 3% for much of 2021. Conversely, the highest rate on record was a whopping 18.63% in October 1981.According to Zillow research, the trend of mortgage rates \u2014 whether interest rates are generally rising or falling \u2014 may influence whether existing homeowners would consider selling their existing house to move into another. With so many existing homeowners paying a much lower mortgage rate, the study found it would take rates to fall somewhere to between 4% and 5% before they would sell the home they're in and buy another.This rate gridlock is contributing to the lack of existing homes for sale.Take action: Consider the interest rate strategies below until (and if) mortgage rates fall significantly lower for an opportunity to refinance.Home valuesThere is a little good news, though. Higher mortgage rates have softened the real estate market, and the increase in home prices is moderating.The rise in existing home values is slowing. Home values are lower year-over-year in almost half (23) of the 50 largest metro areas, according to a Zillow analysis.Take action: Look for homes with price reductions where you want to live. Then negotiate even harder.But listings for existing homes are far fewer. For more than 12 months, new listings have been down year-over-year. The number of new listings of homes for sale is down more than 20% from pre-pandemic levels, according to Realtor.com.Take action: Consider expanding your search to more affordable areas close to your favorite neighborhood if it's too pricey.New home inventory is rising. Construction of new homes is showing promise of growth, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. However, builders are still wary of oversupplying the market, concerned that consumer demand could sag as potential buyers shy away from rising mortgage rates.Take action: If you want to buy a house now, consider new construction. You may be able to choose some finishes or make an even better deal on a spec home that's been on the market for a while.When is a good time to buy a house?Buying a home is more than considering macroeconomic factors. It's an important life decision based on your personal and financial situation.Where do you want to be in 5 years?When you rent, the decision to move is broken down into six months, or a year or two at a time, as your lease renews. But every dollar-related detail makes a home purchase a medium- to long-term investment. Buying a house includes various costs: the down payment, closing costs, and financing fees, moving expenses, property taxes, and perhaps selling your existing place.Homeownership requires a years-long timeline. How you make a living, your friends, family, and even community amenities all come into play.Your incomeA primary consideration: your job. Will it require a location change anytime soon, or can you live where you please? Is your income steady and all but assured?Your credit scoreOne of the significant factors that will qualify you for a home loan is your credit score. It's important to know it before applying for a mortgage.For the most common loan, a conventional mortgage not backed by a government agency, you generally need a FICO score of 620 or better.FHA loans can allow a credit score as low as 580 with 3.5% down. VA loans issued to qualified military service members and veterans don't officially have a minimum credit score, though some lenders will require a FICO score of 620.As a benchmark to where you stand, the median credit score on a new mortgage in the second quarter of 2023 was 769, according to the New York Federal Reserve.Of course, minimum scores are the entry-level to qualifying; the higher your score, the better the loan terms you'll be offered. Most importantly, that can mean you'll pay a lower annual percentage rate over the life of the loan. You may also have more room to negotiate on fees.Your current debt loadA primary financial metric lenders will use to determine your creditworthiness is your debt-to-income ratio.Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored entity that provides liquidity to the home loan market, looks for a maximum total DTI ratio of 36% of \"the borrower\u2019s stable monthly income.\" Exceptions can allow for total DTIs up to 50%, but it's usually best to avoid working on the edges of qualification if you can.You can calculate your DTI by dividing your total recurring monthly debt by your gross (before taxes and other deductions) monthly income.Include debt such as monthly mortgage payments (or rent), real estate taxes, and homeowner's insurance. Also, add any car payments, student loans, and the monthly minimum due on credit cards. Remember any personal loan payments and child support or alimony.Do not include debt such as monthly utilities \u2014 like electricity, water, garbage, or gas bills \u2014 or car insurance, television streaming subscriptions, or cell phone bills. You can also exclude health insurance costs and miscellaneous expenses such as groceries or entertainment.Your savingsHaving a cash cushion in the form of emergency savings shows lenders that you are prepared for the unexpected. Of course, that savings account should also include \u2026Your down paymentA large chunk of your savings account should be dedicated to the down payment. A minimum of 3% down is required in order to qualify for a conventional loan targeted to first-time homebuyers \u2014 or ideally, 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance. Yes, zero-down options exist if you are eligible for a VA- or USDA-backed loan.According to Realtor.com, the average down payment in the first quarter of 2023 was 13%.4 rate-relief strategies to considerBuying a house when interest rates are high can require some financial finesse to enhance affordability.1. Buying discount pointsPrepaying interest in order to lower your ongoing mortgage rate is called buying discount points. One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount. However, lenders sometimes add a point or two to a mortgage proposal to make their loan offer appear more enticing. But you're actually paying for the discount with an upfront fee.When shopping for a loan, compare loan offers with zero points. Then, you can decide whether to buy points to lower your interest rate. It is important to note that buying one point (paying 1% of the loan amount upfront) will generally reduce your interest rate by only one-quarter of a percentage point.2. An interest rate buydownBorrowers can lower their mortgage interest rate for the first few years at the beginning of the loan term with a buydown. Home builders, sellers, and some lenders sometimes offer an interest rate buydown to boost sales.While you get a short-term break on the interest rate, your payments and total interest may actually be higher. It's a strategy that requires running the numbers on the long-term benefits.If you're paying for the buydown, compare a mortgage both with and without a buydown. By the way, lenders will qualify you based on the permanent interest rate, not the temporary buydown rate.3. An adjustable-rate mortgageA mortgage product that increases in popularity whenever rates begin to rise is back: the adjustable-rate mortgage.ARMs have a fixed interest rate for an introductory period, often five to 10 years, and then the rate changes regularly, usually once or twice a year. Tips when shopping for an ARM:Look for an introductory rate that is lower than a fixed-rate mortgage.Choose a term you feel comfortable with, perhaps in line with how long you plan to stay in the home.Make sure you budget for possible increases in your monthly payment if the interest rate moves higher after the end of the introductory rate period.4. A shorter-term mortgageAre you more comfortable with an interest rate that never changes, even if your monthly payment is slightly higher than you'd like? Consider a shorter-term loan. Mortgages with 20- or 15-year fixed terms, as opposed to the traditional 30-year term, typically come with lower interest rates. The lower rate and shorter term combination means you'll gain equity in your home faster, too.Your next moveBuy smart and shop a lot. Relentlessly shop mortgage rates and lenders for the best loan offers and justified fees. Get a written preapproval from your lender, then shop for a house you can love and can afford. Your home buying competition is.According to Zillow, when it comes to first-time buyers versus repeat buyers, first-timers are more likely to reach out to at least three lenders and three real estate agents.","Article Anthor":"Hal Bundrick","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 28, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"36":{"Article Title":"Are electric cars more expensive to insure?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/ev-insurance-153443980.html","Article Content":"Whether you\u2019re considering an electric car for the cutting-edge technology, the fuel cost savings or the environmental benefits, it\u2019s important to understand the specifics about EV insurance.Despite their higher cost, there are more electric vehicles on the road than ever. Insurance companies, in turn, have responded with customized offerings.Here\u2019s what you need to know about how an EV auto insurance policy differs from traditional car insurance coverage \u2013 and what cost differences you should expect.Insurance for electric vehicles: special considerationsYou won\u2019t be required to purchase a special electric vehicle auto insurance policy just because you drive an EV. Car insurance coverage is the same whether you have a gas-powered car or electric car, and there isn't any special policy you are mandated to buy outside of your state\u2019s minimum required auto insurance coverage.Depending on the coverage options you choose and even where you live, EV auto policies will include some combination of:Liability coverage, including property damage liability and bodily injury liability coverage, that pays out for others harmed in an accident you cause.Collision coverage, to repair or replace your vehicle if you\u2019re involved in an accident where someone else isn\u2019t the at-fault driver.Comprehensive coverage for other-than-collision damage, such as vandalism, theft or weather-related events.Uninsured motorist\/underinsured motorist, in case you\u2019re hit by another driver who doesn\u2019t have auto insurance or whose limits aren\u2019t enough to cover your losses.Personal injury protection (PIP), to cover your medical bills and other expenses from an accident like lost wages or home health care.Medical payments (Medpay) coverage, to help with things like co-pays, medical deductibles, prescriptions, and procedures following an accident.Select EV drivers have the option of specialized EV auto insurance policies. This is especially true for drivers of certain Tesla models in select states, who can purchase coverage directly through the manufacturer. This Tesla auto insurance offers many of the same coverage options mentioned above in addition to gap insurance\/auto loan protection in some areas.In the future, carriers may begin offering EV auto insurance policies that also protect the vehicle\u2019s high voltage battery, at-home charging stations, and other charging equipment and parts that aren\u2019t covered by typical policies.Electric car insurance costs (Hint: They\u2019re higher)While not always the case, you can usually count on EV insurance premiums being higher than those for conventional, gas-powered vehicles. The actual cost of your coverage will depend on your driving record, age, gender, location, credit history, coverage options, and the vehicle you drive.There are also some special considerations and features of EVs that can impact your car insurance rates. Here are a few to keep in mind:Electric vehicles tend to have newer and more updated technology, which can be costly to replace and difficult to source.While the purchase cost of EVs has been gradually declining, these vehicles are still more expensive on average than comparable gas-powered vehicles. Because of the higher cost of replacement, carriers may charge more for full coverage, including comprehensive and collision coverage.If your EV is involved in an accident, the high-voltage battery, which powers the electric motor, could be damaged and need replacing. Depending on your vehicle, battery-pack replacement can cost tens of thousands of dollars.Parts for certain EVs may be limited due to small manufacturing processes. This can make the repair process notably more expensive and result in long delays.Not all repair shops are equipped to work on EVs, so your vehicle may need to go to a special shop following an accident. This can be more costly for your insurance company.What about hybrid vehicles?If you own a hybrid vehicle, you\u2019ll encounter some of the same issues with auto insurance rates as EV owners. Hybrid cars have a high-voltage battery that maintains the charge on the vehicles\u2019 electric motors. Repair and replacement can be expensive, and that cost is reflected in the policyholders\u2019 premiums.On the other hand, hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius are self-charging, so you won\u2019t need to worry about installing a charger at your home.Tips for insuring your electric vehicleWhen shopping around for a car insurance policy for your electric vehicle, keep these things in mind to get the right coverage and snag the right price:Research and compare car insurance companies that specialize in EV coverage; these carriers may have the best network of appraisers, parts suppliers, and body shops if and when you need repair. Some offer EV-related discounts that will save you money. For example, Farmers offers a discount to customers in California who drive electric or hybrid vehicles.When comparing carriers, ask whether the policy covers battery replacement, home charging stations or loss of use coverage, and if other additional coverages are available. While this isn\u2019t common yet, you may find a carrier that covers accessories and auxiliary costs involved with your electric vehicle.Be sure to take advantage of rebates, tax credits, discounts, and incentives offered to EV drivers. These might include extra savings for vehicles with autonomous\/self-driving or special security features.Request car insurance quotes from multiple carriers \u2014 including your renters or homeowners insurance provider. Bundling policies with one carrier is a tried-and-true way to get the cheapest rates.Lastly, read your policy terms and conditions carefully so you understand what is and is not covered.

But with more banks offering high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs), money market accounts may not be as advantageous as they were before.When it comes to money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts, there are key differences in terms of yields, minimum deposits, and fees.What is a Money Market Account?Money market accounts, a type of deposit account you can use to grow your savings, are commonly offered by banks and credit unions. They are an account you can use to save for an emergency, a dream vacation, or a down payment on a home.Money market accounts can be appealing because they typically provide higher annual percentage yields (APYs) than savings accounts. As of this writing, the average rate for a traditional savings account was just 0.39%. For a money market account, the average rate was 0.57%.Money market accounts also are more accessible than a traditional savings account; you can withdraw money by writing a check or you can use a debit card to withdraw money at an ATM. However, money market accounts often restrict the number of withdrawals or transfers you can do each month. Depending on your financial institution's policies, you may incur excessive use or withdrawal limit fees if you exceed six in a month.These accounts are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), so your deposits are protected up to a maximum of $250,000. When you\u2019re worried about safety, knowing that your money market account is secure can give you peace of mind.What is an HYSA?A high-yield savings account is a type of savings account that offers significantly higher APYs than the national average. They\u2019re usually available from online banks; because they don\u2019t have brick-and-mortar locations, they have less overhead costs and can provide higher rates to attract customers.Depending on the bank or credit union, APYs on HYSAs can be as high as 5% or more \u2014 significantly higher than the national average for traditional savings accounts.Like money market accounts, HYSAs are usually backed by FDIC or NCUA insurance. And HYSA customers may also have to abide by the six-per-month withdrawal limit. Exceeding that limit could cause your account to be transferred to a checking account, or you may have to pay excessive use or withdrawal fees.Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Key differencesMoney market accounts and HYSAs are tools you can use to grow your savings. They\u2019re secure accounts backed by the FDIC or NCUA and they both provide higher APYs than traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts do differ in several significant ways:APYs: It\u2019s possible to find HYSAs with higher APYs than money market accounts offer.Minimum deposits: You often need hundreds or even thousands of dollars to open an account with a money market account. But with an HYSA, you can typically open an account with a $0 minimum deposit requirement.Balance requirement: Although some money market accounts have low minimum deposit requirements, you usually must maintain a much higher balance to earn the highest-possible APY. For example, you may need to maintain a balance of $25,000 or more to earn the best rate. By contrast, HYSAs don\u2019t usually have tiered rates \u2013 the same high rate applies to everyone, regardless of their balance.Monthly fees: A HYSA usually has low fees or the bank or credit union may charge no fees at all. But money market accounts usually involve monthly account maintenance fees, which can cost as much as $25 per month.Accessibility: When it comes to accessibility, money market accounts tend to have an edge over HYSAs. Money market accounts allow you to withdraw money with a check or debit card, while HYSAs are more limited. Unless the bank behind the HYSA operates branches and teller services, you can only make electronic funds transfers.Pros and cons of money market accounts vs. HYSAsWhich account is better for you: a money market account or an HYSA? Each account has its advantages and drawbacks:Pros of money market accountsThey have higher APYs than traditional savings accounts: Money market account APYs are typically higher than the APY you\u2019d get with a traditional savings account opened at a local bank or credit union.Money market accounts provide easy access to cash: Money market accounts give you check-writing privileges and access to a debit card, making it easy to withdraw money.Money market accounts are liquid: Unlike some other options, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts are liquid, meaning you can access your money \u2014 without penalty \u2014 whenever you want.Cons of money market accountsThey usually have higher minimum deposit requirements than savings accounts: Although the minimum deposit requirements vary by bank or credit union, money market accounts often require you to have hundreds or even thousands to open an account. The minimum deposit requirement can be a significant hurdle for those just starting out or those that are new to saving money.You\u2019re limited in how many withdrawals you can make: Although it\u2019s easier to access your money with a money market account, you are limited in how many withdrawals or transfers you can make per month. If you exceed that limit, the bank can charge you hefty fees per every excess transaction.They often have higher fees: Money market accounts usually charge monthly account fees, and the fees can range from $5 to $25 per month.Pros of HYSAsHYSAs provide higher-than-average APYs: HYSAs provide APYs that are much higher than the national average for traditional savings or money market accounts.They have low minimum deposit requirements: HYSAs usually have low deposit requirements, so you can open an account with as little as $0.Usually, HYSAs have no monthly fees: Because HYSAs are often provided by online banks with low operating costs, they don\u2019t usually have monthly fees.Cons of HYSAsThe APY can change: With some financial products, such as CDs, you can lock in the APY for a specific period, such as 12 to 48 months. But with an HYSA, the rate can change along with market conditions, so the rate could decline.They\u2019re harder to access: With an HYSA, the only way to access your money is to transfer it to another account. You can\u2019t make withdrawals with a check or debit card.You can\u2019t visit a branch: HYSAs are usually offered by online banks, so there aren\u2019t local branches you can visit. When you need in-person help, that can be a frustrating problem.Money market accounts vs. HYSAs: Which account is right for you?High-yield savings account vs. money market: Which is better? There\u2019s no right answer that applies to everyone. Which account type makes the most sense depends on your financial goals, how much money you have available to open a new account, and how much cash you intend to leave in the account.For those that don\u2019t have a lot of money on hand or those that don\u2019t want to worry about monthly fees, an HYSA is likely the better choice. HYSAs provide higher-than-average APYs, and they usually have no minimum deposit requirements, nor do they charge monthly fees.For those that have substantial amounts of money available, a money market account may be a wiser choice than a savings account. If you deposit a large amount \u2014 such as $25,000 or more \u2014 and maintain that balance, you can earn a much higher APY. Plus, you can easily access that money with a check or debit card when you need to tap into your savings.Regardless of which account you choose, do some research before opening an account. APYs, minimum deposits, and fees vary between financial institutions, so compare several options to find the best APY at the lowest cost.Find the best Money Market Account rates!","Article Anthor":"Kat Tretina","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 15, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"38":{"Article Title":"Student loan issues?

Perhaps your payment plan information is incorrect, your payment history isn\u2019t accurately reflected, or your payments aren\u2019t being reported to the major credit reporting agencies.Whatever the issue, there are ways to make a complaint about your student loan servicer if their practices make servicer if their practices are making repayment more difficult or confusing, including filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education.Student loan payments are back \u2014 and things have changedAfter more than three years, federal student loan borrowers are set to resume payments this October. Loans resumed accruing interest on September 1, 2023, and borrowers are expected to make their first payments on October 1, 2023.Many borrowers may notice changes in their balances, payment plans, and even their student loan servicer as they prepare for repayment. In fact, more than four-in-ten borrowers will return to repayment with a new student loan servicer, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board.Throughout the course of the moratorium, three major student loan providers \u2014 Navient, Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), and Granite State Management and Resources transferred their debts to other service providers and are no longer serving borrowers.This change impacted millions of borrowers and could make repayment more confusing for borrowers who aren\u2019t sure who to contact regarding their student loans and may even spot inaccuracies or incorrect information due to these mass transfers.Common student loan errors and how to fix themThere are several common errors student loan borrowers may encounter throughout repayment. As you enter into repayment, you should be sure to keep a close eye out for any errors that are inaccurate and could set back your repayment timeline or ding your credit score.Common errors include:Discrepancies in your loan balances or interest ratesMissing payments in your payment historyIncorrect payment status reported to the credit bureausChanges in your payment due datesThe good news is that there are ways to dispute these errors. Here\u2019s what to do:Contact your student loan servicerIf you notice any errors in the amount owed or your loan interest rates, contact your student loan servicer immediately. You can typically find their contact information on your monthly statement or via the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) website.Before you contact your servicer, take some time to review your loan documents to ensure that there is actually an error.You\u2019ll also want to have your loan documents on hand when contacting your loan servicer. They may ask you for additional information and submit supporting documents, such as a copy of your loan statements or promissory note.Send a dispute letter to your servicerYou should follow up any phone calls to your servicer with a written email or letter to your servicer to help you keep track of your communication with them. This is also an opportunity for you to provide them with supporting documents to support your case.Request assistance from the Federal Studen Aid Ombudsman GroupThe Federal Student Aid (FSA) Ombudsman Group is a neutral, informal, and confidential resource under the U.S. Department of Education. The FSA Ombudsman Group helps resolve complaints for student loan borrowers who received federal student aid and is your last line of defense in helping resolve complaints related to the federal student aid programs, including:Direct LoansFederal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loansPerkins LoansGrant programsIf your loan servicer fails to address your concerns, you can contact the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman Group through one of these methods:MailU.S. Department of EducationFSA Ombudsman GroupP.O.

Generally, federal loans have lower interest rates and added borrower protections than other financing options. But federal PLUS Loans are very different from other federal student loans.As of the end of 2023, 5.4 million borrowers have outstanding PLUS Loans, owing a combined $212.5 billion. Although PLUS Loans are common, they have higher rates and fees than other federal student loans. Before applying for a federal PLUS Loan, learn about their rates, terms, and repayment options.What are PLUS Loans?A federal Direct PLUS Loan is one of the four types of federal student loans that the Department of Education issues:Direct Subsidized: For undergraduate students onlyDirect Unsubsidized: For undergraduate and graduate studentsDirect PLUS: For graduate and professional students and for parents borrowing on behalf of a childDirect Consolidation: For borrowers with existing federal student loansHowever, PLUS Loans are split into two categories, serving different groups: Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS.Grad PLUSGrad PLUS Loans are specifically for graduate or professional students, such as those pursuing a master of business administration (MBA) or attending medical school. Students must be enrolled at least half-time at an eligible school, and their program must lead to a graduate or professional degree or certificate.Parent PLUSWhile Grad PLUS Loans are only for graduate-level students, Parent PLUS Loans are for parents of undergraduate students. The parent will take out a loan in their own name to pay for their child's education, and the parent is the only person legally obligated for the loan's repayment; the child has no obligation to repay the loan.Parent PLUS Loans are limited to biological or adoptive parents. Other relatives, including legal guardians, are not eligible.Federal Direct Loans vs. federal PLUS Loans: What's the difference?In the past, several forms of federal loans were available, including Federal Family Education Loans and Perkins Loans. However, those programs ended. Currently, the Department of Education only issues loans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program.PLUS Loans are part of the federal Direct Loan program, but they function quite differently from the other Direct loans. There are five key differences:1. Rates and feesFederal student loans tend to have lower rates than other forms of education loans. As of the 2023-2024 academic year, Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans for undergraduate students are at 5.50%, and they have a disbursement fee of 1.057% of the loan amount.PLUS Loans tend to be significantly more expensive; Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS have the highest rates of any federal loan. The current rate is 8.05%, and the disbursement fee is 4.228% of the loan amount.2. Grace periodsMost federal loans have a built-in six-month grace period; the student has six months after they graduate or leave school before payments are due. In the case of Direct Subsidized loans, the government covers the interest that accrues while you're in school and during the grace period.That's not the case with PLUS Loans. With Grad PLUS Loans, the loan is automatically deferred while the student is in school, but interest accrues and is capitalized when the student enters repayment.Parent PLUS Loans don't have a grace period. Parents can opt to defer repayment until after the child graduates. However, interest will accrue while the student is in college and will be capitalized when the loan enters repayment.3. Borrowing limitsFederal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans have strict annual and aggregate borrowing caps. Depending on the student's dependency status, year, and loan type, the annual limit ranges from $3,500 to $20,500, and the aggregate limit ranges from $23,000 to $138,500.By contrast, PLUS Loans have no annual or aggregate maximums. Parents and students can borrow up to the total cost of attendance.4. EligibilityUnlike other types of loans, federal student loans have no minimum income or credit score requirements. And in the case of Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, there is no credit check at all.PLUS Loans are the only federal loans that do require a credit check. However, a low credit score or a few missed payments aren't enough to cause you to be rejected for a loan. The Department of Education looks for an adverse credit history, which means your credit report shows one of the following issues:One or more accounts with a combined outstanding balance of $2,085 that are 90 or days delinquent, placed in collections or charged off within the past two yearsDuring the past five years, you have been subject to one of the following:Default determinationDischarge of debt in bankruptcyForeclosureRepossessionTax lienWage garnishmentWrite-off of federal student aidIf you have an adverse credit history, you may qualify for a PLUS Loan by adding an endorser \u2014 a friend or relative with good credit \u2014 that guarantees the loan.5. Repayment optionsWith federal Direct Loans, the standard repayment plan for all loans is 10 years. However, Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans are eligible for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can significantly reduce the borrower's payments. Borrowers can also opt for a graduated or extended repayment plan, allowing them to extend their payments for up to 25 years.Grad PLUS Loans are eligible for all federal repayment plans, including all of the income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. However, Parent PLUS Loans are more restrictive.In their existing state, Parent PLUS Loans aren't eligible for IDR plans, nor can borrowers qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). However, there is a workaround. Borrowers with Parent PLUS Loans can consolidate with a Direct Consolidation Loan. Once the loan is consolidated, they are eligible for one of the IDR plans \u2014 income-contingent repayment \u2014 and can work toward PSLF.How to apply for PLUS LoansThe application process for PLUS Loans works differently than for other federal loans. With federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, the borrower completes the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and they are automatically considered for federal loans. With PLUS Loans, the borrower needs to specifically request them.Borrowers intending to apply for PLUS Loans have to complete the FAFSA, but they also must submit a separate PLUS Loan application. The FAFSA must be submitted before you can apply for a PLUS Loan.You can usually apply for a PLUS Loan online, but check with the selected college's financial aid office first; some schools have different procedures for PLUS Loans.Alternatives to PLUS LoansAlthough PLUS Loans can be useful tools for financing education expenses, they are the most expensive form of federal loans, with the highest rates and fees. And because they have no caps on how much you can borrow, you can easily end up taking on more debt than you can afford. It's important to consider how PLUS Loans will fit into your budget and borrow the least amount possible.Additionally, Parent PLUS Loans are limited to biological and adoptive parents; other relatives or carers are ineligible, so if you need financing \u2014 or want to save money \u2014 consider these other options.Grants and scholarshipsThere are billions of dollars available to college and graduate students in the form of grants and scholarships. And unlike student loans, they don't have to be repaid. These awards can come from colleges, nonprofit organizations, private companies, and even generous individuals. Use the BigFuture Scholarship Search tool to find available opportunities.Work-study programsFederal work-study programs are frequently overlooked, but they can help cover some of your added expenses, including textbooks or supplies. With a work-study program, you work part-time \u2014 either on-campus or off for a local employer \u2014 and earn money to put toward your education. On average, students earn about $1,800 per year from work-study programs.Private student loansPrivate student loans are available to both graduate students and parents.If you are not the adoptive or biological parent and want to help the child pay for school, private student loans can be useful alternatives. They also can be a good option if you have excellent credit; depending on your creditworthiness, you may qualify for a loan with a lower rate than you'd get with a PLUS Loan.Private loans can have fixed or variable interest rates, and lenders typically don't charge disbursement fees. However, they don't have the repayment benefits or perks of federal student loans, so you won't qualify for IDR plans or loan forgiveness, so private loans tend to be best used as a last resort after exhausting other aid.","Article Anthor":"Kat Tretina","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 15, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"40":{"Article Title":"What is rental car reimbursement and what does it cover?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/rental-car-reimbursement-175331598.html","Article Content":"Managing the aftermath of a car accident can be a stressful process. It doesn\u2019t end when you drop your damaged car at the repair shop. While minor repairs from a fender bender can take one to three days, vehicle damage from a major collision can take three weeks or longer to repair.Whether your ride is in the shop for a few days or a few weeks, you\u2019ll still need a vehicle to get around. That's when rental reimbursement as part of a car insurance policy has you covered.What is rental reimbursement coverage?Rental reimbursement coverage is optional coverage you can add to your auto insurance policy that reimburses or pays upfront for the cost of a rental car if your vehicle is damaged in a covered claim. It\u2019s relatively affordable, usually less than $200 a year. In order to add rental reimbursement to your auto policy, the car insurance company typically requires the vehicle to carry full comprehensive and collision coverage.Rental car coverage is subject to specific policy limits like a set dollar amount and time frame when rental reimbursement costs would be covered. For instance, Allstate rental reimbursement pays rental expenses up to $30 per day for 30 days or until your car is back on the road. Any additional rental car costs over the daily limit would be your responsibility.It\u2019s important to note that rental reimbursement coverage isn\u2019t just to defer the cost of a rental vehicle. Often, rental reimbursement includes other transportation expense coverage such as public transportation fares, Uber or Lyft service, or even taxi rides.Rental reimbursement coverage vs. rental insuranceWhile the two terms sound similar, rental reimbursement coverage and rental car insurance are not the same.Rental reimbursement is not included in standard collision or comprehensive coverage but can be added onto auto insurance policies for a low cost. This coverage means insurance will pay the costs of securing a rental in the event of necessary car repairs after a covered accident.Rental car insurance is what rental car companies ask you to add as extra coverage in case your rental car breaks or is involved in an accident. Typically, your insurance covers you while driving a rental car, but you may want more coverage if you don\u2019t carry full comprehensive and collision coverage.How does rental reimbursement insurance work?If you have rental reimbursement as part of your collision coverage and have an at-fault accident, your insurance will cover some costs of a rental or alternative transportation for a covered event.In some cases your auto insurance company directly pays the rental car company, especially if it\u2019s a trusted or in-network partner. In other cases, you\u2019d have to pay the daily rate on the rental and then be reimbursed through the claims process.Read more: How to file a car insurance claimHowever, you may be able to take advantage of rental reimbursement even if you don\u2019t carry full coverage. In a situation where the other driver has been determined to be at fault, their insurance would reimburse costs associated with a covered loss, including the cost of your rental car.In both scenarios, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay a deductible, but there may be a per claim limit to this coverage. That\u2019s why you should always consult with an auto insurance agent or your policy prior to renting for an extended period.It\u2019s also worth mentioning that rental reimbursement won\u2019t usually cover a rental for routine maintenance or other repairs not associated with an accident.What rental costs does the car insurance company cover?Rental reimbursement coverage has its limits. Most states allow you to rent a similar car to the one covered under the policy, but the limits for reimbursement are fixed.What does that mean in practical terms? Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been in a covered accident and you have rental reimbursement. Your insurance company limits coverage to $40 per day or $1,200 per claim.Your SUV is going to be in the shop for at least a month, so you rent a similar one for $50 per day. Your insurance pays the rental company $40 per day and you\u2019re billed for the remainder of the balance. Once the rental bill rolls hits $1,200 claim limit, any additional rental costs are your responsibility.Are there rental car costs insurance won\u2019t cover under rental reimbursement?Keep in mind that even if you have rental reimbursement or travel expense reimbursement for a covered accident or theft, the following usually aren\u2019t part of your coverage:cost of gasmileagesecurity depositadditional rental car insuranceYou\u2019ll also need to make sure the accident or the repairs needed are due to a covered event. For instance, if your car has engine failure, that\u2019s usually covered under a warranty from the car\u2019s manufacturer or the dealership and wouldn\u2019t be eligible for any policy benefits from collision or comprehensive coverage.How much does rental car reimbursement cost?Part of determining how much coverage you need and if it\u2019s worth it involves assessing the financial trade-off. How much does adding rental reimbursement coverage to your auto insurance cost versus the cost of renting a car?The average cost of renting a car varies depending on the vehicle, rental company, and location. You\u2019ll pay around $81 per day according to a 2022 analysis of rental car costs across the country, although that figure goes up substantially in some urban areas.Meanwhile adding rental reimbursement coverage averages around $100-$200 a year depending on the daily limits and coverage you choose. Using back-of-the-napkin math, you\u2019ll pay roughly the equivalent of two days\u2019 car rental fee for a year\u2019s worth of rental reimbursement coverage.Can I add rental car reimbursement coverage after an accident?Unfortunately, adding rental reimbursement after an accident won\u2019t help you with your current rental car costs. But it could help avoid financial fallout if you have a covered event in the future.If the other driver was at fault, their property damage liability coverage should cover your rental car until your damaged car can be repaired, replaced or you are reimbursed for its value. If fault has not been determined, you\u2019ll have to rely on your own rental reimbursement coverage or pay out of pocket and get reimbursed later.Read more: What is liability car insurance and how much do you need?5 reasons rental reimbursement might be worth itRental reimbursement is optional, but there are several reasons experts advise adding this coverage to auto insurance policies for most drivers.1. Rental reimbursement is relatively inexpensive.In terms of value, rental reimbursement offers quite a lot of coverage for a relatively low cost. An Enterprise Rental Reimbursement Study with Qualtrics concluded that even though 59% of eligible policyholders don\u2019t have rental reimbursement coverage, half of those policyholders still rented a car after filing a claim.2. Rental car coverage provides consistency during a difficult time.Enterprise Rent-A-Car data indicates the average rental period after an accident is about two weeks. In the wake of an accident, the last thing you need is worry about how you\u2019ll get back to your daily routine. Rental car reimbursement steps into the breach to reduce stress and minimize disruption during the claims process. Plus having your own vehicle is a huge help if you have to begin shopping for a new (or used) car.3. You can adjust coverage to meet your needs.Rental reimbursement isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all coverage option. Most insurance companies provide options to increase daily limits, so you can adjust your out-of-pocket expenses depending on the rental car market you live in, the size of vehicle you\u2019ll need and more.4. Rental reimbursement covers other transportation costs.Renting a car isn\u2019t your only option with rental reimbursement coverage. Rental reimbursement coverage typically pays $30 or $40 a day. That can go a long way toward covering public transportation or rideshare costs until you get your wheels back.5. Multiple risk factors increase your likelihood of being in a car accident.While the average driver doesn\u2019t get in an accident every year, the National Safety Council says certain risk factors like driving during rush hour can affect your likelihood of being involved in an incident. Living in certain states like South Carolina or Massachusetts also increases your risk, where as many as 12% of drivers have an at-fault accident on their record.If you\u2019ve been considering rental reimbursement, talk to your auto insurance agent to find out what kind of insurance coverage is available. Even if you only have an accident once every few years, rental reimbursement can go a long way toward making a stressful situation a little easier.","Article Anthor":"Kaz Weida","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 14, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"41":{"Article Title":"Car insurance costs for married vs. single drivers","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/car-insurance-married-vs-single-164635100.html","Article Content":"Your financial life can change significantly when you get married. You might save money by splitting household expenses and filing taxes jointly. What\u2019s more, your marital status can influence how much you pay for car insurance.When auto insurance underwriters calculate your car insurance premiums, they don\u2019t solely look at your driving history, car model, and where you live. You might also be asked about your marital status \u2014 you can even save money on your car insurance by being married vs. single.Car insurance rates for married and unmarried driversAccording to a research report from the Consumer Federation of America, married car insurance policyholders tend to have lower insurance premiums than their single counterparts. While differences in premium costs varied among insurers, some single policyholders were found to be paying up to 34% more than married drivers.One reason for the rate differences may be that married people are perceived as more responsible drivers \u2013 although the study also alludes to income differences between married couples and single individuals as playing a role.The Insurance Information Institute states that insurers have long used factors outside of a motorist\u2019s driving record \u2013 such as age, credit history, and marital status \u2013 as determinants in setting car insurance rates because such rating factors have been proven to predict the likelihood of the policyholder filing auto insurance claims.Because an insurance company\u2019s business relies on collecting more money in premiums than it pays out for claims, your insurer will probably charge you higher rates if it perceives you as more likely to file costly claims. Likewise, you can score a lower rate if your insurance company views you as less likely to file claims.It\u2019s important to know that if you live in a state that has banned insurance companies from using marital status in setting insurance rates \u2013 such as Massachusetts and Michigan \u2013 your car insurance cost will not be specifically impacted by whether you\u2019re married or single. But there are other ways in which your marital status can indirectly affect your insurance premiums.Benefits of being married when purchasing auto insuranceThe fact that married couples are viewed as less risky to insure is not the only reason they tend to benefit from lower premiums compared to their single counterparts. Married couples often benefit from other car insurance discounts that don\u2019t apply as often for single people.Many major car insurance companies \u2013 such as Allstate, Geico, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide, State Farm, and USAA \u2013 offer multi-car or multi-policy discounts. Essentially, they reward customers for having more than one vehicle under their coverage or for purchasing homeowners\u2019 insurance, life insurance, or another insurance policy in addition to their auto insurance.Statistically, married couples have a higher probability of owning more than one car, being homeowners, and having life insurance compared to single individuals.Married people also tend to have higher credit scores than single people. Auto insurance companies often analyze credit status when determining car insurance rates, because studies have shown that people with excellent credit tend to file fewer claims than those with poor credit.So while there may not be a specific \u201cmarriage discount\u201d for car insurance, married couples tend to benefit from lower rates in indirect ways.Disadvantages for married couples on the same policyWhile there are clear benefits to being married vs. single when it comes to auto insurance rates, there can be some disadvantages for couples who plan to be on the same policy.If your partner has a poor driving record with a history of claims, it could increase the cost of your auto insurance even if you have a good driving record. Also, if your spouse has poor credit, insurance providers may deem you as more risky to insure and saddle you with higher insurance premiums.If your partner\u2019s driving history or credit is likely to increase your premium, you might consider maintaining separate policies \u2013 either with the same insurance company or different companies. Get car insurance quotes from multiple providers to compare the costs of keeping your policies together or separate.Your insurance company may require that you list your spouse on your policy \u2013 assuming you share a household and are both licensed drivers. However, you can request a named-driver exclusion if you don\u2019t want your spouse included on your policy. Just know that if your spouse drives your vehicle and gets in an accident after being excluded from your policy, your insurance company won\u2019t cover any claims.How do car insurance benefits apply to unmarried couples?If you\u2019re not married but living with your significant other, you might be able to take advantage of some of the benefits that married couples enjoy.Unmarried, cohabitating couples who share a car (or multiple vehicles) can get a joint insurance policy and pursue multi-vehicle discounts or discounts from bundling their car insurance with other policies.If you live together but each have your own car and separate auto insurance policies, you\u2019ll likely need to list your significant other as an occasional driver on your policy. Listed drivers won\u2019t have a positive or negative effect on your insurance rate \u2013 similar to if you and a platonic roommate lived together but owned separate vehicles.If you name your partner as an excluded driver on your car insurance policy, they would not be able to legally drive your car.Insurance considerations for single driversEven though married couples tend to pay less for car insurance, you\u2019re not going to get hitched just for the car insurance savings. There are other ways single people can lower their car insurance costs.1. Evaluate your coverage needs.Although your state may require you to carry a certain amount of liability insurance, other types of coverage \u2013 such as collision insurance, comprehensive insurance, and full coverage \u2013 are optional. You may decide you don\u2019t need as much insurance coverage on your vehicle, especially if it\u2019s a paid-off, older vehicle and you have savings to cover repairs out-of-pocket.2. Adjust your deductible.Most car insurance companies will allow you to opt for a higher deductible \u2013 the amount of money you\u2019ll pay out-of-pocket after a car accident before insurance kicks in \u2013 in exchange for lower premiums. While this can help you save money overall, you must be prepared to pay that increased amount if you get into an accident.3. Improve your credit.Car insurance companies use a credit-based insurance score to help determine auto insurance rates (unless you live in a state that has outlawed the use of credit in underwriting). While this credit-based insurance score is not the same as your typical credit score, taking action to pay bills on time, settle delinquent accounts and lower your overall debt, can improve your standing in insurers\u2019 eyes.4. Maintain an excellent driving record.The more time that passes where you don\u2019t get into any car accidents, receive speeding tickets or file car insurance claims, the better your driving history will be.5. Ask for discounts.In addition to discounts for being an excellent driver, most major car insurers offer discounts for things such as bundling policies, serving in the military, getting good grades (if you\u2019re a student driver), paying your premium annually instead of monthly, enrolling in auto pay and even opting for paperless billing. Check with your insurance company to see what discounts apply to you.6. Shop around for cheaper insurance.It doesn\u2019t always benefit you to stay loyal to your insurance company \u2013 especially when there could be other companies out there offering lower rates. Shop around or contact an insurance agent to help you find the best car insurance for your situation.","Article Anthor":"Nicole Dow","Article Date":"Wed, Sep 13, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"42":{"Article Title":"Pros and cons of CDs","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/pros-and-cons-of-cds-120038549.html","Article Content":"Opening a new certificate of deposit is a big commitment. You\u2019re essentially putting away a good chunk of your cash for a set period of time to earn interest on your savings, usually at a higher rate than a traditional savings account. You can withdraw it early, but a CD usually has high penalty fees if you do this.It\u2019s a good idea to consider your full range of investment options before you choose a savings vehicle. A CD could be the perfect tool to help you reach your goals faster, or it could set you back on your journey.So are certificates of deposit worth it? We\u2019ll explain the pros and cons of CDs and other financial alternatives to help you make an informed decision about where to park your money.Click to compare CDsPros and cons of CDsA CD is a good choice if you\u2019re saving for a specific purchase that\u2019s a long way off because you can pick a term length that ends near when you\u2019ll need the money. Many retirees also use CDs to save money they won\u2019t immediately need and avoid riskier investments in case of a financial downturn.CD prosHigher interest rates: CDs are usually the highest-earning account type at most banks. And your CD rate will remain a fixed rate, even if market rates fluctuate in response to rate changes by the Federal Reserve.Deposits are insured: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures accounts held at banks and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insures accounts held at credit unions up to $250,000 per account, per depositor.Helps you resist the temptation to spend: Having a lock on the CD can help you ensure you don\u2019t withdraw your money before the CD matures to avoid an early withdrawal penalty.Go deeper: How to find the best CD ratesCD consHigh minimum deposit requirements: Most financial institutions require a sizable minimum deposit for CDs. Although, there are several types of CDs with various term lengths. You should ask your financial institution what their minimum deposit requirements are.Early withdrawal fees: Some banks only require you to forfeit your interest, but others charge high early withdrawal fees that can eat into your deposit. When considering a CD for your savings needs, you should think about your time horizon so that you can avoid dipping into your funds before your CD\u2019s maturity date.May earn less if rates increase: Although a fixed CD rate feels like a low-risk way to grow your savings, you could hurt your long-term saving potential. If rates go up after you open the account, you\u2019ll be stuck earning a lower rate until the end of your CD term, which could make your timeline for hitting your savings goals a lot longer.CDs vs. savings accountsSavings accounts are one of the most basic accounts you can find at any bank or credit union. Since fewer withdrawal restrictions exist, they\u2019re a good way to store your liquid cash reserves. They make great choices for emergency funds and general-purpose savings.High-yield savings accounts are another safe way to grow your savings and they offer you the ability to withdraw money penalty free. They also have lower minimum balance requirements, if any.However, in many cases, they offer lower annual percentage yields than CDs.Go deeper: What is a high-yield savings account?CDs vs. money market accountsIf you\u2019re looking for a higher rate of return on your savings, one account option that may be more comparable to a CD than a savings account is a money market account. These can also be great choices to park your liquid cash reserves, especially if you want quicker access to the money.Money market accounts are insured by the FDIC, tend to offer higher APYs than savings accounts and you can write checks or use ATMs. They often have considerably higher minimum deposit requirements.Go deeper: CD vs money market account, what's the difference?CDs vs. investingFor most people, investing in stocks, bonds, or other higher-risk assets is recommended to save for your far-away financial goals, such as retiring or paying for your child\u2019s college. That ensures you earn the highest return possible but still have time to recover when significant market downturns inevitably happen.Investing prosHighest potential for long-term gain: The stock market typically generates higher returns than a CD \u2014 about 7% per year.Easier access to your money: You\u2019ll need to sell your investments to use the cash, but this usually doesn\u2019t come with early penalties like CDs do.Security investments insured by Securities Investor Protection Corp: This protects you if your brokerage firm goes under. It does not protect you if your investment value declines or if you invest in something that\u2019s not covered by SIPC insurance.Investing consTaxes can be confusing: The IRS treats some investment returns differently than the interest you earn from a CD or other deposit account. For example, you may pay short-term or long-term capital gains tax depending on when you buy and sell stocks.Highest potential to lose money: One of the downsides of investing is that with greater potential rewards come greater risks. For example, the stock market declined by 56% from 2007 to 2009.Steep learning curve: It takes time to educate yourself so you can pick good investments.If you're interested in opening a CD, consider the offers from the federally insured issuers below:","Article Anthor":"Lindsay VanSomeren","Article Date":"Tue, Sep 12, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"43":{"Article Title":"What is an excluded driver?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/excluded-driver-160555890.html","Article Content":"An excluded driver is a member of your household named in your auto insurance policy whom you explicitly omit from being covered. They might be a roommate with a suspended license or your adult child who has racked up too many speeding tickets.Once someone has been named as an excluded driver, your auto insurance will not cover them if they drive any of the vehicles listed on your policy.Here\u2019s what else you should know about excluded drivers, how to add them and how they impact your car insurance coverage.What licensed drivers can be listed on your policy?You are generally able to lend your vehicle to family members, household members and friends, and your auto insurance will cover them under the concept of permissive use.Even if a friend borrows your car and causes an accident, as long as they had your permission to use the car, your liability insurance should cover the damage.As a policyholder, you can also list others on your policy as named drivers who have permission to drive your insured vehicles and share full coverage. These additional drivers could include teen drivers, adult children living in your home or unmarried partners.You can also add people as non-rated drivers, meaning their driving history and other rating factors are not included in your rate calculations. You might add someone as a non-rated driver who only occasionally uses your car, such as a college student or deployed military family member. Named drivers, also known as listed drivers, should not drive your insured car regularly. Your insurance company will likely only allow listed drivers who have their own vehicle and\/or valid insurance coverage.Excluded drivers are also specifically listed in your policy \u2014 but for the express purpose of excluding them from coverage.Reasons for excluding a driverThere are many reasons why you might decide to exclude a driver from your car insurance policy, not the least of which is to save money on your premiums. Other reasons to exclude certain drivers are:You don\u2019t want them driving your vehicle. You may live with people you simply don\u2019t want using your car, such as a roommate or adult sibling. While many policies will automatically extend coverage to occasional drivers \u2014 or even require you to add other adults living in the same home \u2014 naming an excluded driver means that person cannot legally drive your vehicle.They\u2019re young or inexperienced. A new or inexperienced driver, such as a teenager, can wreak havoc on your premiums, especially if they later get in an accident or get traffic citations. Instead of adding them to your existing coverage, you can name them as an excluded driver and then purchase an individual policy in just their name, customizing the coverage limits to their vehicle.They have a poor driving record. When there are other adults in your home, your carrier will typically want you to add them to the policy as a named insured or rated driver. If they have a history of traffic violations, car accidents, DUIs, or have had their driver\u2019s license suspended in the past, that poor driving record can come back to bite you in the form of higher premiums. Consider excluding this high-risk driver from your coverage and having them buy their own policy for their own car.They have a history of too many claims. You may choose to exclude a driver from your coverage if they\u2019ve filed too many insurance claims in the past, even if those claims were on another policy or with another carrier. Insurance providers look at claims history when rating drivers and calculating premiums, so excluding them from your policy can save money.How excluded drivers affect your claims and premiumsIf there is a problem driver in your home, one of the best things you can do for your insurance rates is add them as an excluded driver.If this bad driver isn\u2019t excluded from your policy, your carrier may require you to include them as an authorized or rated driver, especially if they live with you. If they are an inexperienced driver, have a history of at-fault accidents or multiple claims, or have a driving record riddled with violations, you may find that your premiums are affected. This is often the case even if you don\u2019t actually give that individual permission to drive your vehicle.By adding them as an excluded driver, both you and your carrier reduce your overall level of risk. Your insurance company is no longer responsible if they drive one of your listed vehicles and get in an accident. Your insurance premiums no longer take their driving history into account, saving you money.Risks of excluded driversOne of the biggest things to remember is that once you\u2019ve excluded a driver from your policy, you cannot allow them to drive your vehicle under any circumstances. Doing so opens you (and them) up to personal liability, were they to be involved in an accident.Except in certain states, your car insurance company will not extend any coverage to a named excluded driver. This means that any property damage, bodily injury, or personal injury protection coverage is null when the excluded driver is behind the wheel, and you could be on the hook for any and all losses.What if an excluded driver has their own insurance?Just because a driver is excluded from one policy doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot have their own insurance. In fact, if that individual plans to drive and\/or has their own vehicle, they will need to purchase auto insurance.If that individual is involved in an accident while driving another vehicle (other than one covered by the policy on which they are excluded), their own coverage should kick in to cover any losses.What happens if you let an excluded driver use your car?If an excluded driver takes your vehicle and gets in an accident, it really comes down to the state and even the individual policy.If they\u2019re at fault, they (and possibly you) may be liable for losses the other driver incurred.If the other driver is deemed at fault for the accident, there\u2019s a good chance that their liability policy will cover any losses incurred, even if the excluded driver wasn\u2019t supposed to be behind the wheel. This will be determined by the insurance adjusters following the accident.With that said: if you name someone as an excluded driver and then allow them to drive your vehicle, there will be repercussions. At the very least, as the policyholder you may be required to add that individual to your own auto insurance as an authorized driver. You can also expect your premiums to rise.How to exclude a driver from coverageEvery car insurance company has its own process for naming excluded drivers on a policy. In most cases, you\u2019ll be asked to sign and submit a driver exclusion form as part of the process.It\u2019s important to note that not all states allow for excluded drivers. Some states may offer limited coverage to excluded drivers, even after they are named on a policy. And in other cases, excluded drivers may only be added once you have shown that they have their own valid auto insurance coverage.You will want to look up the specific rules in your state and also speak with your carrier to see what options you have before moving forward.Can you remove an excluded driver?You\u2019ll need to contact your insurance company if you want to remove an excluded driver. You may want to add them as a covered driver if they improved their bad driving record, for example. Or to take them off your policy altogether, perhaps because they moved out of your home.In any case, bear in mind that your car insurance rates could be affected.","Article Anthor":"Stephanie Colestock","Article Date":"Tue, Sep 12, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"44":{"Article Title":"What is a named insured driver?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/named-insured-192452658.html","Article Content":"Woman at the wheel of a carAs you might guess, the named insured on an auto insurance policy is the individual who purchases coverage and has their name listed on the policy declarations page.The named insured is responsible for paying premiums on the policy as well as filing claims with the insurance provider. They are the only ones authorized to make changes to the policy, such as adjusting coverage, adding authorized drivers or canceling the policy. In some cases, the named insured might be more than one person, such as spouses or joint owners of a vehicle.More responsibilities of the named insuredAs the owner of the auto insurance policy, the named insured is presumed to be the primary driver. This means that their driving record, credit history and more are taken into account when the carrier calculates premiums. The named insured also decides whom the policy covers, which affects premiums.The named insured may also be referred to as the policyholder or primary insured.Other people covered (or not covered) on a policyBeyond the named insured, other drivers may be covered or listed on an auto policy. Because the terms used to identify those drivers can sound similar \u2014 like named driver, non-rated driver and excluded driver \u2014 it\u2019s important to understand the differences.What is a named driver?Additional drivers \u2014 also known as named drivers \u2014 are individuals who aren\u2019t primary policyholders and can\u2019t manage the coverage, but are added to the policy with permission to drive the covered vehicles. These additional drivers could include teenagers or adult children living in the home, unmarried partners, or even spouses who have their own auto insurance policy elsewhere (but have access to your vehicle). You can add named drivers who don\u2019t live in your home but regularly drive your vehicle, such as a good friend or the nanny.An authorized or named driver on an auto policy is considered a rated driver, which means that their actions can affect your premium for coverage. Just adding another driver is likely to raise your rates. But if they get into an accident, get a speeding ticket or have their license suspended for moving violations, you may see an additional increase in your cost of coverage.Some insurance policies offer cheaper premiums by limiting coverage only to drivers named on a policy. These have been banned in some states.What is a non-rated driver?A non-rated driver is an individual who lives in your home or may occasionally drive your vehicle, but won\u2019t affect your policy\u2019s premiums. Also known as a listed or list-only driver, these individuals may have regular access to your vehicle but either don\u2019t drive it or have their own insurance coverage.This may be the case with unmarried partners, roommates, deployed military family members, or even your adult child who is living with you temporarily. When someone is added as a non-rated, listed driver, they may be allowed to borrow your vehicle in a pinch, but aren\u2019t expected to drive your car regularly. Your insurance company will likely only allow listed drivers who have their own vehicle and\/or valid insurance coverage.Since these drivers have their own valid coverage, they won\u2019t be taken into consideration when calculating the premiums for your policy.What is a permissive driver?Most traditional auto insurance policies extend coverage to permissive drivers, the occasional drivers who you might lend your vehicle to, like your best friend. These are non-rated drivers; that is, their driving history and other rating factors are not included in your rate calculations. But if your friend borrows your car and gets into an accident, as long as they had your permission to use the car your insurance should cover the damage.In some states, insurers can offer cheaper premiums by reducing coverage for permissive drivers through provisions known as step-down clauses. The coverage limits enjoyed by named drivers don\u2019t apply; instead, coverage is limited to the state minimum.What is an excluded driver?In some cases, you may want to explicitly name someone on your policy who should not be covered. Once named as an excluded driver, this person\u2019s rating factors (such as their driving history) won\u2019t be factored into your rate. This may be beneficial if you have roommates who aren\u2019t allowed to use your car, for example, or live with a sibling who has a poor driving record.The caveat here is that once a driver is excluded from coverage, they are expected not to have access to your vehicle. If they drive your vehicle and get into an accident, your insurance coverage will not apply. You could also be held liable for any damages or injuries that occur.How named drivers, non-rated drivers and excluded drivers affect your claims and premiumsIf you\u2019re not the only person who ever drives your car, though, or if other adults have access to your vehicle, you may need to add other individuals to your policy in some capacity.Not all added drivers fall into the same category, though. Some drivers are added because they share full coverage and control of the policy. Others have permission to drive your vehicle on occasion and will affect your premiums, depending on factors like their personal coverage limits, but can\u2019t make changes to your policy. And other drivers are excluded from your coverage.Rated drivers are those who actively drive vehicles on the policy, and whose driving records and personal factors can affect your rates.Non-rated drivers are those who have their own separate coverage and even their own vehicle, but may have access to or occasionally drive vehicles you own. Their driving history and personal factors won\u2019t affect your premiums, but they\u2019ll be covered if they get behind the wheel of your car.Excluded drivers are those who may live in your home but aren\u2019t given permission to drive your vehicles. Their factors won\u2019t affect your premiums, but they also won\u2019t be covered if they drive your car and get in an accident.Determining which drivers should be named, added to, or excluded from your auto insurance policy will depend on how your vehicles are used, who lives with you, and what you can afford to spend on your premiums.","Article Anthor":"Stephanie Colestock","Article Date":"Tue, Sep 12, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"45":{"Article Title":"What does collision insurance cover?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/collision-insurance-191301984.html","Article Content":"Collision coverage is auto insurance that helps protect the value of your car in the event of an accident.If you hit another car or back into a telephone pole, for instance, collision insurance will pay to either repair the damage or buy a vehicle of similar current value. In both cases, you pay a deductible, which can be anywhere from $0 to $2,500 or more but typically is about $500.Collision insurance can also help pay for car repairs if another driver hits you but does not have liability insurance \u2014 or enough liability insurance \u2014 to cover your expenses.If you don\u2019t own your vehicle outright, your lender will probably require that you buy collision insurance. It is otherwise optional coverage, but it\u2019s a good idea to have collision coverage if you have a car that you cannot afford to fix yourself.What does collision insurance cover \u2014 and not cover?Collision insurance covers damage to your car when you hit another car or object like a guardrail. It also covers damage from a single-vehicle accident or rollover. Collision insurance can also cover damage from a pothole. Some collision policies include emergency roadside assistance.Collision insurance does not cover damage to other people\u2019s cars; your liability coverage does that. Collision does not cover the cost of medical bills resulting from any injuries, either your own or others\u2019.Collision insurance also does not cover theft, vandalism or damage from hitting an animal, or damage from natural disasters, such as falling tree branches, hail, or flooding. Those events are covered by comprehensive car insurance.How much will my collision coverage pay?Collision insurance will pay for the cost of repairs from a car accident. If your car is a total loss, your collision coverage will reimburse you for the actual cash value of your vehicle at the time of the accident. In both cases, you pay a deductible.If you owe more than the car\u2019s estimated value at the time of the accident, you are responsible for the balance. You can buy gap insurance to cover this unpaid loan balance.How much does collision coverage cost?The average cost of collision insurance nationally was $371 per year in 2020, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. That\u2019s about a third of the average full-coverage car insurance premium of $1,176.Costs vary greatly from state to state \u2014 from an average of $245 a year in Wisconsin to $528 a year in the District of Columbia \u2014 but also from car to car. In general, the more it costs to repair your particular car, the more you will pay for collision insurance.Your premiums will also go up as your risk of having an accident goes up. So if you have prior accidents or are an inexperienced driver, expect to pay higher premiums. Collision car insurance for teens, for example, is significantly higher than it is for middle-aged drivers without recent accidents.In all cases, you can lower the cost of your collision coverage by choosing a higher deductible.Is collision coverage required?No, collision coverage is an optional add-on to your car insurance policy. No state requires collision coverage. However, if you are leasing or financing your car, your lender will likely require that you have full coverage, which includes collision and comprehensive car insurance as well as the liability car insurance required under your state laws.If you fail to buy collision and comprehensive coverages, your lender will buy policies \u2014 very expensive policies \u2014 to protect the value of its collateral, then add them to your loan balance.If you own your car outright, a good rule of thumb is if you could not comfortably afford to pay to replace your car, then you should buy collision coverage.How to save on collision coverageInsurance companies offer various add-on options that may help you save money in the event of an accident. Ask your insurer if they offer any of these programs:Collision deductible waiver. A collision deductible waiver lowers your out-of-pocket costs if you are in an accident caused by an uninsured driver. If you have added this option to your collision coverage, the insurance will waive your deductible in this case. Insurance companies will typically not cover hit-and-runs, except in Massachusetts and California when the driver is identified. Collision deductible waivers are inexpensive, a few dollars a month. It can be a good idea to add the waiver if you have a very high deductible or drive where there are a lot of uninsured drivers.Accident forgiveness. With accident forgiveness, your insurer agrees not to raise your premium after your first accident. Not all accidents qualify for forgiveness. For instance, insurers may exclude accidents with injuries or costly damages. In addition, you usually must be an experienced driver with a recent accident-free record to qualify. Adding accident forgiveness to your auto coverage can spare you the driving points and hefty premium hikes that often follow a collision claim.Disappearing deductibles. Also called vanishing deductibles, some insurance companies offer this to reward drivers who don\u2019t file claims. For every year that you do not file a claim, your deductible is reduced, typically by $50 or $100 per year.Frequently asked questions about your car insurance policyHere are some common situations drivers encounter and wonder how their collision coverage apply.Can I get collision insurance without comprehensive car insurance?Yes, you can choose to buy collision insurance and not comprehensive insurance. Collision and comprehensive are two different types of insurance. While collision insurance covers damage to your car if you hit an object, comprehensive car insurance covers theft or damage from animal strikes, hail, falling tree branches, or other non-driving related events.My car is getting old. Should I drop my collision coverage?When to drop collision coverage is a common dilemma as the odometer on your car rises and the Blue Book value plummets. The general advice is that if the annual cost of the coverage plus your deductible is more than 10% of the cost to replace your vehicle, then it may be worth dropping collision coverage. But don\u2019t drop your coverage if you need a car and cannot afford to buy another if yours is totaled.Do I need collision insurance if I\u2019m an excellent driver?It\u2019s true that if another driver causes an accident, their liability insurance is supposed to pay to repair your car. However, think about how much that could cost. A new car costs nearly $50,000, on average. At the same time, many drivers only carry the minimum amount of liability car insurance, between $5,000 and $25,000 depending on the state. Once that amount is exhausted, you\u2019ll be left to foot the bill or sue. If you have collision insurance, your insurer will take care of both. And if you have uninsured motorist coverage that includes property damage, you may not need to tap into your collision insurance.Is my car covered if I wasn\u2019t the one driving?Probably. Insurance typically travels with the car, not the driver. If someone else crashes your car \u2014 as long as the person had your permission to drive the car and was not an excluded driver on the insurance policy \u2014 your car will be covered under your collision insurance. An excluded driver is someone in your household who has been removed from your policy. This might be a teenage driver or a driver with an accident history that would raise your insurance cost.What if my car is totaled?If your car is totaled, your collision coverage will reimburse you for the value of your vehicle at the time of the accident, minus your deductible. This amount is negotiable to some degree and can include taxes and licensing costs you have already paid out.Are there other things that collision insurance will not cover?Neither comprehensive nor collision insurance pays for damage due to normal wear and tear or mechanical issues. Other common exclusions are damage incurred if you were engaged in illegal activity at the time of the accident, the cost to repair modifications that your insurer didn\u2019t agree to cover, damage to your personal possessions, or damage incurred when an excluded driver was at the wheel.","Article Anthor":"Karen Aho","Article Date":"Tue, Sep 12, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"46":{"Article Title":"What is a money market account?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/what-is-money-market-account-132821980.html","Article Content":"Money market accounts are deposit accounts that share features of savings and checking accounts. They\u2019re interest-bearing like a savings account \u2014 your balance earns interest \u2014 but they also frequently offer check-writing capabilities and debit card access like a checking account.Besides having components of savings and checking accounts, money market accounts also have distinct features that set them apart. Here\u2019s what to know if you\u2019re interested in opening one.What is a money market account?As mentioned, money market accounts are similar to both savings and checking accounts. And like other deposit accounts, money market accounts are often insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Both national institutions provide up to $250,000 in deposit insurance on consumer bank account balances. This insurance protects your account balance if your bank or credit union defaults.A common misconception is that money market accounts are the same as money market funds. While their names sound similar, the two work very differently. Unlike money market accounts, which carry deposit insurance, money market funds are not deposit accounts or insured by the FDIC or NCUA.Instead, money market funds are a type of mutual fund you can invest in through a brokerage. These funds can gain or lose money regularly based on stock market performance. Your money market account balance isn\u2019t tied to market performance.How do money market accounts work?While money market accounts have characteristics of savings and checking accounts, they often come with relatively high minimum balance requirements. For instance, you may need to maintain a $3,000 minimum balance with a money market account to avoid monthly fees. This generally isn\u2019t the case with checking or savings accounts.In addition to minimum balance requirements, money market accounts may have tiered annual percentage yield (APY) structures that set them apart from other deposit accounts. Higher APYs may be reserved for account holders with larger balances, while smaller balances may earn less interest. For instance, a bank might offer a 0.10% APY on balances up to $5,000, a 0.50% APY on $5,001 to $10,000, and so on. Rates on money market accounts are typically variable, meaning they\u2019ll likely change over time.As with other accounts, money market accounts may be subject to fees and limitations. Watch out for minimum balance fees, monthly maintenance fees, and more. And pay attention to withdrawal limits. While the Federal Reserve eased withdrawal limits in 2020, some banks still impose them. It\u2019s common for banks to charge fees for exceeding six withdrawals in a month.Pros of money market accountsRelatively high APYsFlexibilityFDIC insuranceCons of money market accountsMay have high minimum balance requirementsMay have a tiered APY structureFees and withdrawal limits may applyMoney market accounts vs. other savings optionsSavings accountsTraditional savings accounts are widely available at banks and credit unions, and these accounts tend to offer nominal APYs and flexible access to your money. Your rate with a traditional savings account may be slightly lower than that of a money market account.While your balance will be easily accessible with both account types, money market accounts typically offer debit card access and check-writing capabilities, similar to what you\u2019d get with a checking account. These features aren\u2019t always available with savings accounts.Certificates of deposit (CDs)When you deposit your money into a CD, you essentially promise your bank you\u2019ll deposit it for a fixed term, such as one or three years. In exchange, you\u2019ll benefit from a high APY, which varies by bank. CD rates may be higher than money market account rates depending on your financial institution.Because CDs come with set terms, you\u2019ll typically have to pay penalties if you withdraw your money early \u2013 often a few months\u2019 interest on the withdrawn amount. With a money market account, you typically won\u2019t be required to leave your money deposited for a set time. Instead, you can withdraw it as you please up to your bank's limits.High-yield savings accountsWith a high-yield savings account, your APY may be higher than what a money market account offers. For instance, you might get a 3.00% APY no matter your balance in a high-yield savings account and a 0.10% APY for money market account balances below $5,000. Both types of accounts typically offer easy access to your balance, allowing you to deposit and withdraw funds as you please.While check-writing and debit cards are common with money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts might not offer these features. But depending on the bank, some high-yield savings accounts may come with debit cards.Money market fundsWhile a money market account is an insured deposit account, a money market fund or money market mutual fund is an investment that the FDIC or NCUA doesn't insure. Unlike money market accounts, where your balance won\u2019t decrease due to market conditions, money market funds can gain or lose money depending on the market.In general, though, money market funds are considered fairly low-risk investments. That\u2019s because the underlying fund invests in low-risk, short-term debt securities. Because money market funds are relatively low-risk, their historical returns aren\u2019t as high as other higher-risk investments.Choosing a money market accountAs with any account, it\u2019s essential to compare options if you\u2019re interested in a new money market account. Researching the following factors can help you find an account that best meets your needs:APY: In general, a high APY can mean you earn more interest on your account balance. Compare rates as you shop around for a new money market account.Minimum balance: Certain accounts may have minimum balance requirements. Pay attention to any initial deposit or minimum balance requirements to ensure a new account is right for your financial situation.Account features: While many money market accounts offer check-writing privileges and debit card access, comparing different account features is still important. Look at potential restrictions on withdrawals. For instance, does the bank limit how much you can withdraw or how often you can take money out in a month?Fees: Some banks may charge you fees if your money market account balance drops below a specific amount. Other fees may apply as well. Keep in mind that if a money market account offers a high APY and high fees, it may not be the best choice. Calculate how fees may impact your balance in addition to interest before opening a new account.Managing a money market accountAs with other types of savings accounts, you\u2019ll likely be able to track money market account transactions and review your balance online. Some banks may also offer a mobile app that allows you to access your account at any time. Others may have physical branches you can visit.Overall, a money market account may be a smart option for short- or medium-term savings goals. For instance, if you want to build an emergency fund or save for a car down payment, opening a money market account could work in your favor. These accounts aren't great for long-term savings goals, such as setting aside cash for retirement, as investment accounts may offer better returns.Find the best Money Market Account rates!","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"47":{"Article Title":"How to open a money market account","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-to-open-money-market-account-165204823.html","Article Content":"This image was created by Yahoo Finance using the Picsart AI image generator.Maybe you love the accessibility your checking account provides but hate that it doesn\u2019t earn interest. If this is the case, a money market account may be worth considering. Money market accounts offer the flexibility of checking accounts, but they\u2019re also interest-bearing like savings accounts, meaning you earn money on your deposits.While money market accounts have perks, they also have some drawbacks to consider. Here\u2019s what you need to know about money market accounts, their pros and cons, and how to open one.What is a money market account?A money market account is a unique type of deposit account with checking and savings account features. These accounts generally come with debit cards and checkbooks, similar to what you\u2019d get with a checking account.But unlike checking accounts which typically don\u2019t earn interest, money market accounts often have variable interest rates comparable to high-yield savings account rates. Tiered rate structures may apply with money market accounts, with the best rates reserved for the highest balances. Depending on the credit union or bank, you may also need to meet a minimum balance requirement.But a money market account could be a good choice if you can easily meet the minimum balance requirement. These accounts offer the accessibility you\u2019d get with a checking account, coupled with the decent interest earnings you\u2019d get with a savings account.Preparing to open a money market accountDoing your due diligence before opening a new money market account is key. Many banks and credit unions offer these accounts, and you can compare new account options online at your existing institution or at another local branch. Here\u2019s what to look at as you prepare to open a new account:Interest rates: Different banks and credit unions offer different interest rates, and in general, a higher rate is more favorable because it\u2019ll help you earn more interest on your money. Tiered rates are common with money market accounts. For instance, you might get a 1.15% rate with a $1,000 balance and a 4.05% rate with a $10,000 balance.Fees: You\u2019ll want to consider account fees and how they could impact your overall earnings, too. Common fees for money market accounts include monthly maintenance and low balance fees.Minimum balance requirements: Certain money market accounts may require higher initial deposits or minimum balances than traditional savings accounts. For instance, you might need to maintain a balance of $2,000. Minimum balance requirements vary by institution.Lender reputation: Research lender reputation before you sign up for a new account, especially if you\u2019re considering a bank or credit union you\u2019re unfamiliar with. Ensure the institution is FDIC- or NCUA-insured and look at feedback on consumer review sites like Trustpilot and Consumer Affairs.ATM access: If free ATM access is important to you, learn more about prospective accounts\u2019 ATM networks and whether you can easily access your money for free locally.Steps to open a money market account1. Choose a financial institutionAfter thoroughly researching your options, choose your bank or credit union and money market account. Consider preparing a short list of potential options and narrowing it down to one as you move forward.2. Gather necessary documentsYou\u2019ll need to provide certain documents and information to open your new account. The bank or credit union will probably ask for your Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), a valid government-issued ID like your driver\u2019s license, and proof of address. Gathering this information before you open an account can simplify the process.3. Review account terms and conditionsBefore opening an account, ensure that you review the account\u2019s terms and conditions. These documents outline potential fees, minimum balance requirements, and more. You may want to review them for each account on your shortlist before choosing the best option.4. Sign up for an accountOnce you\u2019ve taken these steps, it\u2019s time to open your account. Many institutions let you sign up for a new account online, which can be convenient. Others let you sign up in person or over the phone. Choose the option that\u2019s most comfortable for you.Funding a money market accountAs mentioned, money market accounts often have an initial deposit or minimum balance requirement, which may be higher than you\u2019d see with checking or savings accounts. Minimum balances can vary depending on where you choose to open an account.If your new account requires you to make an initial deposit, you can generally do so by transferring money from an existing account or depositing a check. To ensure that your balance continues to grow, consider setting up automatic transfers from your savings account to your money market account. You can generally do this by logging into your online account, clicking \u2018transfer\u2019 or \u2018transfer or pay,\u2019 and creating a new monthly transfer.Managing a money market accountIn general, money market accounts are fairly easy to manage. The main things you\u2019ll want to do are tracking interest earnings and avoiding fees. Since rates can change over time, tracking how much interest your money earns can help you ensure your account stays aligned with your financial goals. And doing things like meeting or exceeding any minimum balance requirements can help you avoid fees.Make it a point to log into your money market account online regularly. Doing so will offer insight into how your savings are performing.Things to consider when opening an MMAWhile money market accounts have many perks, they also have a few drawbacks. Variable interest rates are a potential downside, as it\u2019s possible your interest rate will decrease as the market changes. For example, your rate may be above 4.00% when you open your money market account, but it could drop to 3.00% if your bank adjusts its rates.Fees are also a key consideration, as these charges could hurt your balance over time. Take care to avoid fees as much as you can.There\u2019s also the unlikely possibility that your financial institution could fail. But assuming you\u2019ve opened an account at an FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution, your balance will be protected up to $250,000 if this happens.Find the best Money Market Account rates!","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"48":{"Article Title":"How much is a money market account minimum balance?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/money-market-account-minimum-balance-223241169.html","Article Content":"This image was created by Yahoo Finance using the Picsart AI image generator.If you\u2019re shopping for a new deposit account, you may have come across money market accounts (MMAs) while comparing options. Certain banks and credit unions offer these accounts in addition to savings and checking accounts. Money market accounts share some features of checking and savings accounts, such as check-writing capabilities and decent interest rates.But they have some distinct features too. For instance, you might see relatively high figures listed for money market account minimum balance requirements. Your minimum balance is the amount your bank requires to establish your account, earn interest, or avoid fees. Here\u2019s what to know about money market account minimum balances if you\u2019re considering opening one.Find the best Money Market Account rates!Money market account minimum balance requirementsWhen it comes to money market account minimum balance requirements, there\u2019s not one set amount. Instead, minimum balance requirements vary by bank or credit union, and sometimes by individual account. So while one bank may require you to maintain a $2,000 minimum balance in your money market account to avoid fees, another might not have a minimum balance requirement.In addition to minimum balance requirements, certain institutions may also have initial deposit requirements for money market accounts. This is the amount your bank or credit union requires you to add to your account after opening it. As with minimum balance requirements, initial deposit requirements also vary by institution. For instance, you might see a $500 initial deposit requirement at one credit union and a $0 initial deposit at another.Factors that influence money market account minimum balancesWith money market accounts, it\u2019s fairly common to see a tiered rate structure, meaning your interest rate differs depending on your account balance. Accounts with large balances, such as $10,000 or more, may get the highest rates, while smaller balances may only be eligible for lower rates.While not all MMAs have them, fees might apply if you don\u2019t maintain the minimum balance your bank or credit union requires. Before opening a new money market account, it\u2019s essential to review its terms and conditions, which cover any minimum balance requirements, account rates, and potential fees.Advantages of meeting minimum balance requirementsIf your money market account has a minimum balance requirement, it\u2019s advantageous for you to meet it \u2014 banks and credit unions may charge monthly fees for falling below the minimum balance requirement, and doing so may also result in a lower interest rate, depending on whether there\u2019s a tiered rate structure in place.If it\u2019s doable, it can be beneficial to maintain a large enough balance to get the best possible interest rate for your money market account. For example, say your bank offers a 4.50% rate for balances $10,000 or more, but a 1.50% rate for balances $1,000 or less; the difference between interest earnings can be substantial:This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Strategies to help you meet money market account minimum balance requirementsIf you\u2019re concerned you\u2019ll struggle to meet your money market account\u2019s minimum balance requirements, here are a couple of approaches you can take:Set up automatic transfers: Using automatic transfers from an existing savings account could help you maintain your MMA\u2019s minimum balance. These are typically easy to set up through your bank account\u2019s online dashboard.Consolidate accounts: If you have a traditional low-rate savings account, you might also consider consolidating that balance with your money market account balance. This could result in a higher interest rate and more money earned on your balance.Reallocate your budget: Revisiting and reallocating your budget could also help you meet your MMA\u2019s minimum balance requirement. For instance, you might reduce your spending in certain categories and move any money saved into your MMA.While meeting your MMA\u2019s minimum balance requirement is an admirable goal, it\u2019s important to consider your overall financial goals as well. If meeting that requirement means stretching yourself too thin financially, it may not be worth it. Alternatively, a different MMA or high-yield savings account with a low or no minimum balance requirement may be a better choice.Things to consider before opening a money market accountBefore opening an MMA, consider whether you can comfortably meet any minimum balance requirements. Also, be aware that your interest rate could change as your bank or credit union adjusts its deposit account rates. While you won\u2019t lose money with an MMA, you could earn less interest due to future rate decreases.As you compare accounts, research applicable fees, requirements, and rates. If available, read the terms and conditions of each account you\u2019re considering. Doing so will allow you to make an informed decision about which MMA is best for you.","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"49":{"Article Title":"How does a money market account work?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-does-money-market-account-work-154432244.html","Article Content":"Money market accounts are a type of deposit account that offers flexible access to your funds, coupled with a higher interest rate than what you might get with a traditional checking or savings account.A money market account can help you work toward and achieve your short-term savings goals, but how does a money market account work? Before you open one, it's crucial to understand how they work and their limitations.Features of a money market accountMoney market accounts are hybrid bank accounts, offering features that you can get from both checking and savings accounts. Here's a quick summary of the features of money market accounts and how they compare to other types of savings accounts:Types of money market accountsAs with savings accounts, there are two types of money market accounts: traditional and high-yield accounts. Traditional money market accounts offer relatively low interest rates, albeit better than most traditional savings accounts on average.In contrast, high-yield money market accounts offer interest rates that are much higher than traditional money market accounts. That said, they may or may not offer higher rates compared to some high-yield savings accounts.Find the best Money Market Account rates!How money market accounts workAs you compare your savings options, here's a breakdown of how money market savings accounts work:Access to funds: Like a checking account, you can typically access your money using a debit card, paper checks, an ATM card, or via bank transfer. That said, you may be limited to six withdrawals per month, which is a feature shared with savings accounts. After that, your bank or credit union may charge an excessive withdrawal fee or even decline your requests.Interest: You can expect to earn interest on your balance, typically at a higher rate than traditional checking and savings accounts. That said, interest rates can vary depending on the financial institution and the type of money market account you choose. Also, some financial institutions may offer tiered rates based on your balance.Monthly fees: Like checking accounts, some money market accounts charge monthly fees, though you may be able to get yours waived if you meet certain criteria.Insurance: Like other deposit accounts, the funds in your money market account are typically federally insured, either through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).Balance requirements: Balance requirements can vary, but in some cases, you may need to meet a certain minimum requirement to avoid a monthly fee or even to earn interest.Money market account prosThere are a few benefits to using a money market account to stash your savings over other options:Higher interest rates compared to savings accounts: In most cases, money market accounts offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. However, some high-yield savings accounts can be competitive with high-yield money market accounts.Lower risk compared to other investment options: If you're saving for short-term goals or emergency needs and don't want to risk losing money, a money market account can be a great alternative to investing the money.Easy access to funds: While there may be limits on how often you can withdraw, you'll still have easier access to your funds than with a savings account.Money market account consWhile there are some clear benefits to using a money market account for your savings, it's also important to consider the potential drawbacks:Limited withdrawals: If you plan to use your money market account for everyday banking, think again. While the federal government no longer limits monthly withdrawals to six on money market and savings accounts, many banks and credit unions have retained the limit and may charge you a fee for excessive withdrawals.Lower potential returns compared to riskier investments: If you're looking for a place to put your money for long-term financial goals, you'll have a better chance of earning a higher return with an investment account.Fees and charges can eat into returns: If your money market account charges a monthly fee, it'll diminish or even neutralize your interest earnings.Choosing a money market accountIf you're considering a money market account, it's important to research and compare multiple options before settling on one. As you shop around, here are some factors to consider:Interest rates, including stipulations like balance requirements or tiersMonthly fees and excessive withdrawal feesMinimum deposit requirements to open an accountOptions for funds accessFor the most part, online banks offer the best money market account interest rates, but some traditional banks and credit unions also offer them.Managing a money market accountHere are some steps you can take to make the most of your money market account and your short-term savings goals:Track your account activity: Keep track of your deposits and balance, particularly if you use the account to work toward a specific financial goal. Also, track your withdrawals to ensure you don't exceed your account's monthly limit.Evaluate and adjust your saving strategies: Regularly assess your approach to your short-term savings goals and adjust as needed. For example, if you've recently incurred some emergency expenses, it may make sense to focus on replenishing your emergency fund over other goals, such as a vacation or home down payment.Plan for long-term savings goals: While a money market account can be a good spot for short-term savings needs, you'll be better off with an investment account for long-term financial goals like retirement, education planning, and more. While investing is riskier, it'll also increase your potential for higher returns over time.","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"50":{"Article Title":"Can you lose money in a money market account?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/can-you-lose-money-in-money-market-account-182341738.html","Article Content":"Money market accounts act as a hybrid between a checking account and a savings account, offering higher interest rates and flexible access to your funds \u2014 albeit with some limitations.It's technically possible to lose money in a market account, but not in the same way you can lose money in an investment account. Depending on the terms of your money market account, you could lose value to fees and inflation.If you're considering putting your money in a money market account for short-term savings goals, here's what you should know.What is a money market account?A money market account is a type of deposit account that you can use for short-term savings. Like a checking account, a money market account typically allows you to access your funds through a linked debit card, paper checks, or an ATM card.At the same time, money market accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts, although they also usually come with the same monthly withdrawal limits. If you withdraw money more than six times in a month, you may incur a fee with each additional withdrawal.Money market accounts may have steep deposit requirements and even charge a monthly fee, though you may be able to get the charge waived if you maintain a minimum balance. Your interest rate may be flat regardless of your balance, or you may be offered tiered rates based on your balance.Can you lose money in a money market account?Unlike an investment account subject to risk, you won't lose money in a money market account due to investment losses. However, there are other ways your account balance can decrease over time or lose value in the long run:You can lose money to fees: If your account charges a monthly fee that you can't get waived, or you end up dealing with other fees, such as excessive withdrawal penalties, your account balance could drop if the fees exceed the interest you earn in the account.Your interest rate can decline: Banks and credit unions set interest rates based on a variety of economic factors. If you open a money market account when rates are high but steadily decline, the value you thought you would get would decrease along with the rates.Your money will lose spending power over time: Even when money market account interest rates are high, they're still typically not high enough to outpace the prevailing inflation rate. That's why these and other types of savings accounts are best used for short-term financial needs and goals rather than long-term objectives.While you can't necessarily avoid the prospect of your balance losing value due to inflation, you can avoid potential fees by shopping around and comparing rates and fees across multiple financial institutions.In particular, look for money market accounts that don't charge monthly maintenance fees or that make it easy for you to get the fee waived each month.If you're considering using a money market account for your regular banking, consider opening a checking account and a money market account or high-yield savings account instead so you don't lose money to excessive withdrawal fees.Is a money market account FDIC insured?If you open a money market account with a bank, it's very likely that your funds will be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The same is also true if you open the account with a credit union, but coverage for those institutions comes from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).Covered accounts include:Checking accountsSavings accountsMoney market accountsCDsThe FDIC and NCUA offer insurance protection to consumers in the event that a bank or credit union fails. If that happens, your balance is protected up to $250,000 per financial institution, per person, per ownership category.For the vast majority of Americans, that's plenty of coverage. But if you have more than $250,000 that you want to place in a money market account, consider spreading your funds across accounts with multiple banks or credit unions to ensure that all of your money is protected.Alternatives to money market accountsWhile a money market account can be a great place to stash some cash for short-term needs, high deposit and balance requirements and monthly fees may leave you looking for alternatives. Here are a few other options you may want to consider:High-yield savings accounts: A high-yield savings account can offer interest rates that rival even the best money market account rates. In most cases, these accounts also don't charge monthly service fees.CDs: Interest rates on both money market and high-yield savings accounts are variable, meaning they'll fluctuate over time. If you want to lock in a fixed interest rate on your funds and can leave the money alone for a set period, a CD could be a good fit. CD terms can range from just a few months to several years and can offer the highest rates for any savings account. That said, if you withdraw your money before your account matures, you may incur a penalty.Low-risk investments: If you want to keep your money relatively safe but aren't saving for a specific goal, you may consider investing in low-risk securities, such as money market mutual funds and bond funds. While these options present a higher risk of losing your money, they can also potentially generate higher returns.As you consider your current financial needs and goals, take your time to research all of your options to determine which one is the best fit for you.Find the best Money Market Account rates!","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"51":{"Article Title":"What is direct deposit?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/what-is-direct-deposit-165957739.html","Article Content":"Pay tax schedule date in calendar or bill payment recurring agenda, salary accountant plan or annual money subscription cartoon illustration, budget target or loan credit payday imageDirect deposit is an electronic transfer of money into a bank account (usually a checking account) that doesn't use a paper check or cash. Most people come across direct deposit when starting a job and enrolling in an employer's direct deposit program for their pay. Still, the term can describe many electronic transfers between financial institutions.Direct deposits, handled by the Automated Clearing House transaction system, are used to disburse government payments such as Social Security, veterans' benefits, and tax refunds. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, most federal relief payments were made via direct deposit.Direct deposit is faster, more secure than a paper check, and cheaper for banks to process. It's also more convenient for you because once you set it up for your pay or other regular payments, deposits happen automatically. You can also split a single direct deposit payment between different accounts.Direct deposit can also save you money since many banks will allow you to waive checking account fees if you set up direct deposit of your paycheck or benefits payment.How does direct deposit work?Direct deposit works by your employer running payroll on preset days and triggering payments to employers where money goes from their business account to individual, personal bank accounts. So rather than being issued a paper check, you'll see your paycheck amount as a deposit into your bank account.Direct deposit can pay you as frequently as you would get paid through a physical check. For instance, if you get paid every two weeks, direct deposit can be set up to pay employees every two weeks. Likewise, if you get paid on the first and 15th of every month, you can get paid through direct deposit that way as well.You can set up direct deposit through your payroll system if you work for yourself. First, you'll need to have a business bank account. Then, you can create a direct deposit from your business bank account to your personal one. It still takes a few days to process payroll, so give yourself a cushion for payment. That means if you have bills on autopay from your personal bank account, be sure to pay yourself from your business bank account early enough to make those payments on time.Direct deposit isn't just for work-related settings and paying employees. For example, you can set up direct deposit to receive your tax refund, pay child support or alimony, or manage your bills.Benefits of direct depositSpeedPaper checks hold up the payment process because you have to wait for payroll to run, paychecks to get issued, and the employee has to find time to deposit that check. With direct deposit, your company can run payroll, and you can receive those funds in your account within a couple of days.SecureWhether it's from the business side or the employer side, you don't run the risk of losing a paycheck with direct deposit. Everything happens electronically.FlexibilityYou can set up your direct deposit to go to multiple accounts. That means if you want some money to hit your regular checking account and then some to hit a savings account, you can. This means some funds can go directly into building up your savings rather than wait on you to trigger that transaction.Discounts and dealsSome banks offer deals on accounts that set up direct deposit. If you set up direct deposit and receive your paycheck electronically, you could avoid paying a monthly maintenance fee or other charges.How can I set up a direct deposit?If you have a bank account, you can set up direct deposit.Whether you're starting a new job or your current job is moving to a direct deposit system, you'll need to talk to your company's payroll or human resources department to get started. You'll usually need:Your bank accounting numberYour bank routing numberThe name of the financial institutionThe type of account you have (checking or savings, for example)You can find these details when you log into your bank's website and click on the account you'd like the money to go into. Each banking portal is different but look for \"accounting\" and \"routing\" numbers. You can also find these numbers on your personal checks, if you have those.Some companies or payroll systems might have additional requests when you set up your account. For instance, some request you bring in a voided check with your banking information.After you've submitted your banking documents, your company will set up your payroll information and sync your data with their payroll schedule. Now, payroll can be processed, and employees can get paid. Depending on your employer and the company's payroll system, it can take a few days to several weeks. Ask your company's human resources representative when to expect your first direct deposit.When you set up direct deposit, your company will have a payroll portal you can log into to check your payment details. This includes when you last got paid, how much that payment was, and how that check was paid out, including Social Security, Medicare, state taxes (if any), and any other withholdings you have set up. You can also find copies of your pay stubs to save for your records.","Article Anthor":"Dori Zinn","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"52":{"Article Title":"How to open a checking account","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-to-open-checking-account-181402931.html","Article Content":"A checking account can simplify tasks like paying bills and making everyday purchases.

A large ATM network is ideal, as it allows you to easily access your money without worrying about out-of-network ATM fees.Access to physical branches: If you\u2019d like to bank in person, consider whether physical branches are easily accessible in your area.Account bonuses: Certain institutions may offer checking account bonuses, often worth $100-$300, to entice potential customers to open a new account. Generally, you\u2019ll need to meet certain criteria to earn a checking account bonus, such as setting up direct deposit or depositing a set amount within a specific timeframe.Other features: Also look into other features, such as whether the account earns interest or offers online bill pay. Many accounts provide the latter, but not the former.Mobile app access: If you prefer to bank on the go, be sure your bank or credit union has a mobile app you can use to track and manage your spending.Bank or credit union reputation: As a first step, ensure that each institution you\u2019re considering has FDIC or NCUA deposit insurance. If your bank or credit union fails, this insurance will protect your checking account balance, generally up to $250,000.\u00a0Also, look at the CFPB complaint database and consumer review sites to learn about past banking customers\u2019 experiences.Find the best checking account ratesGathering required documentsAfter you\u2019ve narrowed down your options, it\u2019s time to gather the required documents to open a checking account. In addition to providing some basic personal information, you\u2019ll also need to verify the information you share.Your bank or credit union will likely request a copy of your Social Security card, Individual Tax Identification card, driver\u2019s license, or passport to verify your identity. You\u2019ll probably also need to verify your address with a copy of a recent utility bill, mortgage statement, or rent payment. Having these handy before you complete an application can make the process quicker and easier.Filling out the applicationCompleting an application for a new checking account is fairly simple, especially if you\u2019ve gathered the necessary documents beforehand. Most banks and credit unions let you open an account online, though some may let you do so over the phone or at a physical branch.Before moving forward with any application, ensure you read the online terms and conditions of a potential account. Taking this step will help you better understand account features, fees, and requirements. Note that most institutions only allow you to open a new checking account if you\u2019re 18 or your state\u2019s age of majority. Some may have other requirements too. For instance, you may need to be a credit union member to open an account.Provided you meet all requirements, you\u2019ll need to provide personal information on your checking account application, like your name, address, and email. Your bank or credit union may also ask if you\u2019re currently employed and request that you input your annual income. Additionally, you\u2019ll likely need to share copies of one or more documents mentioned above for verification purposes.Funding the accountMany institutions require a minimum deposit to open a new account. Typically, these deposits are relatively small, often up to $25. You can fund your new account online or in person by transferring from another bank account, writing a check, or using an existing debit card.If your new checking account has a minimum balance requirement, deposit enough funds to avoid potential low balance fees. High minimum balance requirements are uncommon with checking accounts, but they sometimes apply.Activating the accountIn addition to funding your new account, you may also need to verify it via email as an added security measure. Many institutions also require that you set up multi-factor authentication, which involves providing multiple data points to verify your identity. For instance, if you\u2019d like to log into your new online account, you may need to provide a unique SMS code or answer a security question and share your username and password.You\u2019ll likely receive a debit card in the mail within 5-7 business days after opening a new checking account, and you\u2019ll need to activate that as well. Your new card will typically come with a sticker on the front with a phone number. Call that number to verify you\u2019ve received your card and activate it.Activating your account and debit card will ensure you can easily access your money and take advantage of your new checking account\u2019s features, such as online bill pay. Setting up multi-factor authentication and verifying receipt of your card also help protect your account from unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions.","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"53":{"Article Title":"Can you cash a check without a bank account or ID?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/can-you-cash-check-without-bank-account-id-155116813.html","Article Content":"Cashing a check is relatively easy if you have a bank account and a photo ID to prove your identity. But if you belong to one of the roughly 5.9 million households in the US without access to a bank checking account or you don't have a valid photo ID, you'll have a little less flexibility.So can you cash a check without a bank account or ID? Yes, but it may be a bit more complicated or inconvenient. Here's what you need to know.Understanding the check-cashing processWhen you receive a check, you can deposit the funds into your checking account \u2014 either in person or via your bank's mobile app \u2014 or you can cash it.Before you cash a check, you'll need to sign or endorse the back of the document. There's no fee to cash a check with your own bank. But if you don't have a bank account, you may cash it with the issuing bank or utilize a check-cashing service, for which you'll be charged a fee.The fee can vary depending on the bank or check-cashing service, and it may be either a flat amount or a percentage of the check's value. In some cases, it can be as much as 12% of the check amount.Additionally, some check-cashing companies may try to upsell you on other expensive services they offer, such as payday loans. You could also be at risk of being robbed by people who are aware that customers leaving check-cashing stores may be carrying a lot of cash.Find the best checking account ratesOptions for cashing a check without an IDRegardless of where you go, having an ID is generally required to cash a check in person. However, there may be some alternatives, depending on your situation:ATM: If you have a bank account but don't have an ID on hand, you may be able to cash your check at one of your bank's ATMs. Keep in mind, though, that not all banks offer this feature.Mobile check-cashing app: Some mobile apps allow you to cash a check without a bank account. PayPal is one example and even offers instant access to your funds for a small fee.Third-party endorsement: You may be able to sign the check over to someone else and have them cash it for you. Simply write \"Pay to the order of\" and include the person's name. Keep in mind, though, that many banks and even check-cashing services may not accept third-party checks due to a risk of fraud. If they do, they may still require your ID to verify that you authorized the endorsement.Options for cashing a check without a bank accountIf you're wondering how to cash a check without a bank account, the process is a bit easier than if you don't have an ID:Issuing bank: When you cash a check, the financial institution or check-cashing store is taking the risk that the account the check is drawn from may not have enough funds to cover the check amount. However, if you go to the bank that issued the check, the teller can check the account balance and confirm that information. Keep in mind, though, that the issuing bank may charge a fee for the service to non-customers.Retailers: Some retailers, including Walmart, Kroger, and Safeway offer check-cashing and other money services in their stores. They typically charge a fee, but it's generally lower than what you'd pay at a check-cashing store.Check-cashing stores: You can visit a local check-cashing store to cash your check. Keep in mind, though, that this option tends to be more expensive than the others.Note that retailers often have limits on how much they're willing to cash. In contrast, checking-cashing stores may not have a limit as long as they can verify the check. If you're wondering how to cash a large check without a bank account, the issuing bank is probably your best bet.Tips for safe and secure check cashingIf you don't have a bank account or an ID, it's crucial that you take steps to protect yourself and your funds during the check-cashing process. Here are some things you can do:Verify the check's legitimacy: If you've received a check from an individual or organization you know and trust, you may not be concerned about the document's legitimacy. But if you've received a check out of the blue, contact the issuing bank listed on the check to verify that it's real. Rather than using the phone number listed on the check, look up the bank's name online and contact its official customer service line.Research check-cashing services: Because check-cashing services can charge high fees, it's important to shop around and compare several options to limit your costs.Use someone you trust for a third-party endorsement: If you're hoping to cash a check with a third-party endorsement, make sure you pick someone you trust to avoid theft.Protect your personal information: Regardless of how you cash the check, don't give out any personal information that isn't necessary for the check-cashing transaction. That includes sensitive information like your Social Security number and date of birth.Alternatives to check-cashing servicesIf you want to avoid costly fees, inconveniences and even some risks, here are some alternatives to using a check-cashing service:Opening a bank account: Consider opening an account with a local or online bank to make it easier to deposit funds and manage your money. If you're concerned about having negative items on your bank history report, some banks offer second-chance bank accounts that don't consider this information when you apply.Requesting a new payment method: If you don't have an ID, you may consider asking the payer to send the money through a peer-to-peer payment app or another way, so you don't have to provide your ID to get the funds.Getting a prepaid debit card: You don't need a bank account to open a prepaid debit card. Once you open an account, you can deposit checks through the card issuer's mobile app without a fee, then use your card to spend the funds.Take your time to research all of your options to determine the best fit for you.","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"54":{"Article Title":"Can you have two checking accounts at the same bank?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/can-you-have-two-checking-accounts-same-bank-211421331.html","Article Content":"Having multiple checking accounts can make it easier to organize your finances, but managing your money across different banks and credit unions can complicate things. So, can you have two checking accounts at the same bank? Generally, yes. Here's what you need to know and whether opening multiple checking accounts is a good idea.Understanding checking accountsA checking account is a type of deposit account that you can use for everyday money management. It's generally used as a hub for all of your financial activity. You'll receive deposits from your employer, which you can then use to pay bills, make debt payments, and make everyday financial transactions.Checking accounts offer easy access to your money via a debit card, personal checks, ATMs, and online transfers. They're generally risk-free, and in rare cases, they may even offer rewards in the form of cash back on your debit card purchases or a high interest rate on your balances.In most cases, however, they don't offer interest, and some banks charge monthly fees and fees for overdraft protection and other services.Can you have two checking accounts at the same bank?Each bank has its own policies for how many accounts you can have. But in general, having more than one checking account with the same bank is possible.For example, you may choose to have an individual account plus a joint account with a partner or teenage child. It can also be a good idea if you've started a business and want to separate your personal and business expenses.Check with your bank to learn about the process for opening a second checking account. While some allow you to open another account online and link it to your online banking, others may require you to contact them or open the account in person.Find the best checking account ratesReasons for having multiple checking accountsThere are several good reasons to consider opening more than one checking account. Here are some of the advantages to consider:Better organization of funds: If you're on your own, you may not need to have more than one checking account. But if you have a partner or a teenager, using multiple checking accounts can help you better organize your finances, budget, and track expenses between multiple people.Separation of personal and business expenses: Even if you're running a sole proprietorship, opening a second checking account is crucial for maintaining proper expense tracking, especially for tax season. Keeping personal and business expenses in the same account will make it difficult to know which ones you can deduct on your business tax return.Easier tracking of expenses and budgeting: Using multiple checking accounts could potentially help you better track and budget for specific expenses. For example, you could have one checking account specifically for debt payments, another for recurring expenses, and another for discretionary funds.Easier access: Many online banks don't have physical branches, so it can be tough to deposit cash. If you prefer the features of an online bank but need to make cash deposits now and then, you may consider opening a second account with a bank that has local branches where you live.Potential drawbacks of having multiple checking accountsWhile there are some clear advantages to using more than one checking account to manage your money, there are also some downsides to keep in mind:Extra fees and expenses: If your bank charges a monthly fee, there's typically a way you can get it waived. But if you spread your income and expenses across multiple checking accounts, it may be harder to meet the eligibility criteria for each account. One way to combat this is to pick a bank that doesn't charge monthly service fees.Difficulty in managing multiple accounts: While using multiple checking accounts can simplify your finances in some ways, it can make things more complicated in others. Unless you use budgeting software to keep track of all of your accounts and transactions in one place, it can be difficult to manage all of your accounts and stay organized.Increased risk of overdrafts: Spreading your money across multiple accounts means that you have less funds in each account. Even if you have a system in place to keep track of each account, you're still at risk of overdrafts, which can be costly.Alternatives to multiple checking accountsIf you're unsure about using multiple checking accounts to manage your money, here are some potential alternatives to consider:Online banking tools: Many banks offer budgeting and expense-tracking tools that can help you improve your financial management. Check with your bank to see what's available. If your bank doesn't offer financial tools, consider switching to a financial institution that does.Budgeting apps: Budgeting apps can offer a host of features to help you better manage your money. Some even allow you to link multiple financial accounts and import transactions from each one, so you can manage everything in one place. Not all budgeting apps are created equal, however, so it can take some time and research to find the right one for you.High-yield savings accounts: If you have specific savings goals you want to work toward, having one or more high-yield savings accounts could be a better approach. Some banks also allow you to open multiple savings accounts, making it easier to track each goal separately. What's more, you can earn a high interest rate on your balances.As you think about your situation and goals, take your time to research all of your options to find the best strategy for you.","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"55":{"Article Title":"Can you deposit someone else\u2019s check in your account?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/can-you-deposit-someone-elses-check-in-your-account-233027454.html","Article Content":"Your parents wrote a check to your child for his birthday. A neighbor wrote a check in your husband\u2019s name. A friend owes you money and wants to give you their latest paycheck as payment.Whatever the case may be, there are some scenarios where you may need to cash a check written to someone else. Can you deposit someone else\u2019s check in your checking account? It\u2019s possible under some circumstances, but the rules are strict.Find the best checking account ratesUnderstanding the laws surrounding check depositsBanks and credit unions are highly regulated, and there are rigorous rules that they have to follow concerning deposits, withdrawals, and verifying customers\u2019 identities.According to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) \u2014 a set of laws that regulate banking transactions \u2014 for a bank to cash a check, it must be properly payable, meaning the customer authorized the payment and the payment doesn\u2019t violate the bank agreement.Keep in mind that depositing a check written out to someone else outside of permitted circumstances can be illegal. If you sign the check as that individual and deposit it into your account, you could be charged with check forgery.When you can deposit someone else's checkUsually, when cashing a check, two parties are involved: the payer who writes the check and the payee who deposits or cashes it. But with third-party checks, the check is cashed in another person\u2019s name.Although you can legally deposit a third-party check under certain circumstances, not all banks will accept them, as banks can set their own policies regarding third-party checks.There are a few scenarios where you may want to deposit a check written out to someone else:You have a friend\u2019s permissionIf you have a friend or relative who wants to sign over a check to you, you must confirm with your bank that it will accept it, as not all will. You can improve the odds of your bank accepting the check by having your friend come with you to the bank to provide the teller with identification and consent.Your friend will have to endorse the back of the check and write \u201cpay to the order of\u201d and your name on the endorsement area.You have a joint accountIf you have a joint account with your spouse or partner, the bank can require that both of you sign the check if it\u2019s made out to two people.If the check is written out to just one person, either person can cash or deposit the check into the account.You\u2019re cashing a check on behalf of a minor or someone under your legal guardianshipIf your child is a minor and receives a check, you can cash it on their behalf. However, you must specify your relationship to your child on the check and sign your own name.In the endorsement area, print the child\u2019s name and add a hyphen and the word \u201cminor.\u201d Under that line, print your own name, add a hyphen, and describe your relationship to the child. For example, \u201cparent,\u201d \u201cguardian,\u201d or \u201cfather.\u201d Sign your name under that line.Many banks prohibit mobile deposits of third-party checks, even if it\u2019s a parent cashing a check on behalf of a minor, so you may need to visit a bank in person.You have power of attorneyWhether you\u2019re helping an elderly parent or a relative who is in the military and serving overseas, you may have power of attorney (POA) to handle their financial affairs.As the POA, you can manage matters on their behalf, including depositing or cashing checks. Typically, the POA is added as an agent to the account. But can you deposit someone else\u2019s check in your account online? Generally, you can as long as you are listed as an agent on the account.If you have POA and need to cash a check written out to your relative, print their name in the endorsement area. Under it, print your own name and your role as agent or POA, then add your signature.When you need to cash or deposit the check, you may need to bring a copy of the POA form if you aren\u2019t a listed agent with that particular bank.You need to deposit a check made out to a deceased relativeIf you are the executor of the deceased\u2019s estate, you may be able to cash or deposit the check for particular purposes, such as payments for tax refunds or goods and services they purchased prior to their death.However, if an executor was not named, the check cannot be cashed or deposited; it must be returned to the certifying agency and you must wait until the probate process is complete.You have to cash a check written out to your businessIf you run a business under a different name than your own, you can usually still cash it, but you\u2019ll have to endorse it on behalf of the business.In the endorsement area, sign the name of the business, sign your name, and write your title. For example, you might write \u201cOwner\u201d or \u201cCEO.\u201dWhen you can\u2019t deposit someone else's checkAlthough depositing a check written in someone else\u2019s name is possible, there are some legal issues you should be aware of first.If you deposit a check with someone else listed as the payee without proper endorsement, the bank could flag the check as fraudulent. Check fraud or forgeries are serious issues \u2014 depending on the check amount, those offenses can be misdemeanors or felonies \u2014 and cashing someone else\u2019s check without their permission can have significant legal consequences.Risks associated with depositing someone else's checkCashing third-party checks can be risky. Depending on the circumstances, you could face the following issues:Delayed funds: With third-party checks, the bank could take more time to verify the check and put a hold on the funds. If you rely on that money to cover your bills, that delay can be a costly problem.Overdraft fees: Banks have to make deposits available quickly. A check may be cleared, but if it turns out later to be a bad check, you\u2019re responsible for the funds. You could incur serious overdraft fees along with the lost money.Damaged relationships: Before cashing a check, be sure you have your friend's or relative\u2019s express permission. Ideally, they\u2019d accompany you to the bank or provide a written statement. Otherwise, you risk damaging your relationship if they feel you wrongfully cashed the check.Common check-cashing scamsA common scam involves a scammer signing over a check to you to deposit, usually for more than they owe you.For example, a remote job listing may promise upfront payment and send you a check for more than the promised amount. Your \u201cboss\u201d may ask you to use some of the money to buy electronic gift cards you send them. The check turns out to be bad so you have to repay that money, and the scammer makes off with the gift cards.If you\u2019re a victim of a fake check scam, contact the Federal Trade Commission and your state\u2019s attorney general.Alternatives to depositing someone else's checkCan you deposit someone else's check in your account? Yes, but it can be more complicated than depositing a check written out to you. Some banks prohibit it, and there are some risks involved.Instead, consider these alternatives:Be patient: Have the payee cash the check in their name. Once it clears, they can transfer the funds to you or write you a check in your name. This approach will take longer, but there\u2019s less of a chance of issues.Get added to the account: Many banks will allow you to add a trusted individual to an account and get check deposit or cashing privileges.Open a joint account: If you frequently have to cash a check on behalf of a child, open a kid\u2019s checking account. These accounts require a parent to be on the account too, which will allow you to cash or deposit checks.Explore other payment options: Consider peer-to-peer payment services like Venmo or Zelle rather than signing over checks. They\u2019re quick and easy to use, and don\u2019t require you to jump through hoops like you have with third-party checks.","Article Anthor":"Kat Tretina","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"56":{"Article Title":"What is a checking account?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/what-is-a-checking-account-210520837.html","Article Content":"According to the 2021 FDIC National Survey of Underbanked and Unbanked Households, approximately 96% of US adults have a savings or checking account. Checking accounts are one of the most common deposit accounts available, and you can open one at many banks and credit unions. These accounts offer a convenient way to pay bills and track and manage your daily spending.If you\u2019d like to open a new checking account, here\u2019s what to know about these accounts, how they work, and how to use and manage them effectively.Understanding checking accountsA checking account is a deposit account that\u2019s available at numerous financial institutions. Whereas a savings account is often used to set aside money for specific financial goals, a checking account is primarily used for everyday spending. Generally, checking accounts come with debit card access and check-writing privileges, making it easy to access the funds in your account when needed. These accounts often have no or low minimum balance requirements.While most checking accounts aren\u2019t interest-bearing, meaning your balance won\u2019t earn money, some do earn interest. However, interest rates are typically lower than what you\u2019d see with a savings account. Unlike many traditional checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts may require maintaining a set minimum balance to earn interest.Banks and credit unions sometimes offer special bonuses for opening a new checking account and meeting specific requirements. For instance, if you deposit $1,500 and set up direct deposit to your new account in the first 60 days, your bank might give you $200.Some checking accounts may come with fees. For example, overdraft and non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees are relatively common, so be mindful of this as you compare options.Opening a checking accountOpening a new checking account is typically straightforward, but your financial institution will require some information and documentation from you. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll likely need to provide:NameAddressSocial Security number (SSN), Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN), US passport, driver\u2019s license, or another document to confirm your identityUtility bill, mortgage statement, or another document to confirm your addressOpening deposit, which is generally a small amountMany credit unions and banks let you open checking accounts online, but you could also open one over the phone or in person, depending on the institution. Before you start, look for checking accounts offering bonuses, as a decent bonus could be a relatively easy way to earn some extra cash.Using a checking accountAs mentioned, checking accounts typically come with debit cards and check-writing privileges. Depending on the merchant, you can make payments with both your debit card and checks. Many checking accounts also let you set up online bill pay, one-time or recurring. For instance, you might choose to automatically pay your monthly gas and electric bills from your checking account.If you need cash, you can withdraw funds from your checking account at a local branch or by using your debit card at an ATM, no matter if the ATM is in your bank\u2019s network or not. But remember that you might pay a fee for using an out-of-network ATM. You can deposit checks and cash into your checking account in person, in-network ATMs, or via mobile deposit (if your bank supports this option).Managing a checking accountBefore online banking\u2019s prevalence, people balanced their checkbooks on paper using a check register each month. With a check register, you write down every payment you make with a check and reconcile your expenses at the end of your statement cycle. While it\u2019s still possible to track check payments this way, getting an accurate picture of your balance is more challenging if you also frequently make debit card payments.For this reason, many people manage their checking accounts via an online dashboard or bank and credit union mobile apps. These tools allow you to quickly and easily view your balance and track and reconcile your spending through monthly account statements. Mobile apps also offer convenient features like low balance warnings and transaction alerts, which can help you avoid overdrafting your account.Overdraft and non-sufficient fund fees (NSF) are common with checking accounts, and these fees are generally comparable. For instance, your bank may charge a $35 overdraft fee if you overdraw your account or a $35 NSF fee if you\u2019ve opted out of overdraft protection. These fees typically apply if you make a purchase with your debit card and your checking account balance can\u2019t cover the cost.Fortunately, managing your transactions effectively and tracking your balance closely can help you avoid fees. For added protection, you can generally link your checking account to another deposit account, such as a savings or money market account. If you accidentally overdraw your checking account, the difference can be taken out of your linked account.In addition to overdraft and NSF fees, certain checking accounts may also have monthly service fees. These fees are generally small but can still add up over time. Ideally, choosing a checking account with no monthly service fees is best.Alternatives to checking accountsAlternative options are available if a checking account doesn\u2019t sound like the best fit for your financial situation. Instead, you may want to consider the following:Savings accounts: A savings account may be better if you\u2019d prefer to build an emergency fund, save for a specific goal, or seek a higher interest rate than a checking account provides. These accounts often have monthly withdrawal limits and typically don\u2019t come with debit cards or checks.Money market accounts: Money market accounts have rates comparable to savings accounts but come with debit card access and checks. Monthly withdrawal limits may apply with a money market account.Prepaid debit cards: Prepaid debit cards are another alternative if you prefer not to open a new bank account. With a prepaid card, you can spend up to the amount you add to the card. Once you\u2019ve spent your card\u2019s balance, you can opt to reload it. These cards can be a useful alternative to cash but typically have high fees.Find the best checking account rates","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"57":{"Article Title":"Checking vs. savings accounts: What\u2019s the difference?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/checking-vs-savings-account-103047755.html","Article Content":"Checking accounts and savings accounts offer different benefits and limitations, and you\u2019ll probably need both to manage your money.

High-yield savings accounts \u2014 most often available through online-only banks \u2014 can offer interest rates that are many times higher. Once your savings account reaches an amount sufficient to cover emergencies and near-term expenses, consider stashing money somewhere with better returns.Savings accounts also often charge monthly fees unless you meet certain conditions, such as putting in place an automatic transfer from your checking account or maintaining a minimum balance.

A requirement to open an account in person is not a red flag, but if convenience is important, it could be a factor.Few to no fees. Many checking accounts come with fees but also offer ways you can avoid them. For instance, directly depositing your paycheck is a common way to get some or all checking account fees waived. There are others, and you should read the fine print or ask a representative to find out exactly how the account fees work. Other fees to watch out for include overdraft, monthly maintenance, and nonsufficient funds fees, among others.Insured and protected. Be sure the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) insures your account. If your bank or credit union fails, your money is insured up to $250,000. Additionally, some banks will cover any losses from fraudulent use of your debit card, a convenient protection if your card is lost or stolen.Other important factors to consider:Physical branch. You may appreciate the convenience of visiting a local bank branch if you need to speak to someone in person about your account.Customer service and a mobile app. A powerful and easy-to-use app and a well-designed website can make banking much more convenient. Visit the website and read app store reviews to determine the bank\u2019s online offerings. You should also check the account\u2019s security provisions, and ensure customer service is available 24\/7 on the telephone or through online chat.Multiple accounts. The ability to link multiple accounts is a valuable feature. It\u2019s convenient; often linking your savings account to your checking account can be a tool to avoid overdrafts.How to choose a savings accountHere are some important factors to consider when choosing a savings account.APY. The higher the annual percentage yield, or APY, the more interest you earn on the money in your account. High-yield savings accounts offer higher APYs than traditional savings accounts.Account requirements. Some banks have a high minimum initial deposit to qualify for the highest APY or even open an account. Make sure you\u2019re eligible for an account before you try to open one.Promotions and bonuses. Some banks offer promotions such as a cash bonus if you deposit a set amount within the first few weeks of opening an account or a high introductory APY that can boost your interest earnings for an introductory period.Fees and penalties. Check for minimum balance, nonsufficient funds, and other fees, and be sure you understand them and how to avoid them.","Article Anthor":"Dori Zinn","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"58":{"Article Title":"Where are the routing and account numbers on a check?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/where-are-routing-and-account-numbers-on-check-145645481.html","Article Content":"If you have a checking account, chances are you also have a checkbook.

Own an antique tractor or exotic sports car for pleasure use? Maybe you\u2019re tinkering with a WWII Army Jeep to drive in parades?Classic car insurance, one of many specialized types of auto insurance, is what you\u2019ll need to protect your investment.What is classic car insurance?Classic car insurance policies recognize the intangibles that make older or collector vehicles valuable \u2014 typically far more valuable than the day they rolled off the showroom floor. For the insurance to remain affordable, however, classic car insurance provides less coverage than standard auto insurance. For example, it won\u2019t cover the car if it\u2019s used for regular transportation or is not securely stored.That means collector car insurance is best for valuable cars that are rarely driven.What makes a car a collector car?According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), there is no uniform definition of a classic, collectible or antique car. \u201cIf a car\u2019s value exceeds its original selling price, then it might be considered collectible and a candidate for specialized classic car insurance,\u201d says the III. This could include:Antique vehicles and vintage cars that are more than 25 years oldHot rods, muscle cars, and modified vehiclesExotic and luxury carsVintage military vehicles, antique tractors and classic trucksClassic motorcyclesSome classic car replicasMileage limits for classic car insuranceSome insurers set mileage caps with options for 2,500, 5,000 or 7,500 annual miles, and nearly all limit usage to enthusiast meetings and exhibits, tours and occasional pleasure driving, which has the same effect.Classic car insurance vs a standard auto policyClassic car insurance is similar to regular auto insurance in that it offers coverage for property damage and bodily injury liability, up to set amounts and with agreed-upon deductibles. But the similarities pretty much end there.With classic car insurance, your car must qualify as a collectible and be treated as such, meaning there are limits on where it can be driven and stored. For example, you may have to have a garage.In addition, while regular car insurance covers a car\u2019s \u201cactual cash value,\u201d which is factors in the depreciation of that make, model and year, classic car insurance policies use an \u201cagreed-upon value,\u201d which considers the appreciated price that your specific car would fetch at a collector\u2019s auction. Classic car insurance may also help pay for hard-to-find replacement parts and spare parts and provide roadside assistance.Can you insure a classic car as a daily driver?No. Any car used for regular errands and commutes requires a standard auto insurance policy. Classic auto insurance excludes daily driving and typically limits where or how much you can drive the car. Some insurers even require proof that you own another car for daily use.Classic car insurance coverage is designed to offer affordable insurance for vehicles that would be exceptionally costly to replace. Since daily driving increases the risk of an accident, insurers are able to reduce the cost of collector\u2019s car insurance by limiting usage. In fact, Hagerty.com, a company that specializes in classic car insurance, cites daily use as a central definition of a classic vehicle, saying, \u201cif it isn't a vehicle you drive for your everyday transport, Hagerty can protect it.\u201dWhat is the mileage limit for classic car insurance?Some insurers set mileage caps with options for 2,500, 5,000 or 7,500 annual miles, and nearly all limit usage to enthusiast meetings and exhibits, tours and occasional pleasure driving, which has the same effect.Does insurance restrict who can drive a classic car?Insurers typically sell collector car policies only to experienced drivers with good driving records. This further reduces the risk of an accident and a costly claim. It is common that the named insured must be at least 25, with no moving violations within the last three or five years. Policies also typically require that the owner, as well as all licensed drivers in the household, have a regular-use vehicle with standard insurance.Is classic car insurance cheaper?Classic car insurance is typically a good deal cheaper than standard car insurance. By limiting who can drive the car and how much, insurers are able to dramatically reduce the risk of an accident.Hagerty says its classic car premiums are 34% lower, on average, than daily driver premiums. American Collectors Insurance advertises its classic policies as up to 40% less than standard policies. Bailey Insurance says its collector car policies typically run between $200 and $600 per year unless the car has a very high value, compared with more than $1,000 annually for standard car insurance.What is stated value insurance?Stated value is what is used in standard insurance policies. If your car is a total loss, the insurer pays the actual cash value of the car at the time it\u2019s totaled. Actual or stated value does not consider the collector\u2019s value, and older cars are generally worth less and less with each passing year.Classic cars typically are insured for \u201cagreed-upon value,\u201d which is the amount that you and the insurer agree the car would be worth at auction. If you make improvements to the car, you can negotiate a new agreed value.How do I get collector car insurance?Most auto insurance companies offer classic car policies for some types of classic cars, and you may be able to get a multiline discount if you use your existing insurer. But insurance companies that specialize in collector cars are more likely to cover your unique car and to offer a broader array of policy options. These include Hagerty, American Collectors Insurance, American Modern Insurance Group and Grundy Insurance.Just as you should when shopping for any auto policy, seek multiple car insurance quotes for this type of coverage. A classic car policy should be affordable while giving you peace of mind that your unique investment is protected.","Article Anthor":"Karen Aho","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"60":{"Article Title":"What is non-owners car insurance?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/non-owners-car-insurance-180243621.html","Article Content":"If you don\u2019t own a vehicle, you might assume that you don\u2019t need to purchase your own car insurance coverage. However, for some occasional drivers, a policy known as non-owners auto insurance can be a smart idea.Here\u2019s a look at what non-owners car insurance policies are, what sort of coverage they offer, and how to choose the right policy for you and your needs.Understanding non-owners car insurance policiesA non-owners insurance policy is a type of auto insurance coverage for drivers using a vehicle they don\u2019t own. These policies are reserved for drivers who don\u2019t have their own vehicle and therefore aren\u2019t required to buy their own separate coverage.Unlike your options for a standard car insurance policy, buying auto insurance without a car comes with more limitations. While a typical full coverage auto policy includes liability insurance, collision coverage, and comprehensive insurance, non-owners insurance provides you with only basic liability protection. That means that in the event of an accident, it won\u2019t cover damage to the vehicle you're driving or your own injuries.As with standard policies, you may also be able to purchase supplemental medical payments coverage, personal injury protection (PIP), and uninsured\/underinsured motorist coverage with your non-owners policy. The exact coverage options and features available will depend on your state and the carrier you choose.Who should consider purchasing non-owners insurance policies?If you don\u2019t own a vehicle, you aren\u2019t legally required to purchase an auto insurance policy in any state. In fact, you can\u2019t buy a standard policy if you don\u2019t own a vehicle to attach it to. But if you drive on occasion, a non-owners auto insurance policy provides a good layer of protection.You may want to consider buying a non-owners policy if you:Frequently rent or borrow vehicles from othersDrive regularly but don\u2019t have consistent access to one particular carWant to maintain continuous coverage (to avoid a coverage gap), even when you don\u2019t own a carAre in a transition period, such as moving to a new location or waiting on a vehicle you\u2019ve orderedSo, do you need insurance to drive someone else\u2019s car? No, you don\u2019t. That owner\u2019s policy will follow their vehicle and, with few exceptions, the coverage will still protect you from liability while you\u2019re behind the wheel, as long as they\u2019ve given you permission to drive.However, even with someone else\u2019s coverage, you might not be protected enough.What does non-owners car insurance cover?Non-owners auto insurance provides you, the driver, with your own liability coverage while you\u2019re driving someone else\u2019s vehicle, whether borrowed or rented. It includes bodily injury liability and property damage liability to cover other drivers\u2019 losses if you are responsible for an accident.Depending on the state and the car owner\u2019s coverage options and limits, your non-owners policy may act as secondary coverage. This means that it would only kick in if the owner\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t cover the property damage or bodily injuries in an at-fault accident. In this case, your non-owner policy will kick in to pay for damage that exceeds the vehicle owner\u2019s coverage limits.You may also choose to add underinsured or uninsured motorist coverage to a non-owners insurance policy. This optional coverage protects you personally if you\u2019re involved in an accident for which you are not-at-fault. If the other driver doesn\u2019t have insurance \u2014 or their policy\u2019s liability limits aren\u2019t enough to cover your expenses, medical bills, etc. \u2014 then this coverage will step in to pay the difference.Lastly, some non-owners insurance policies will even allow you to add many of the same features and options as a standard policy, such as rental car insurance or roadside assistance. Even if you don\u2019t own a vehicle, this coverage can be utilized to provide you with an alternate vehicle if your rental (or the car you usually borrow) is wrecked, or even dispatch help if you\u2019re stranded on the side of the road.How much does non-owners car insurance cost?Non-owners policies typically cost less than a standard liability policy. While actual costs vary based on your driving history, the state where you live and other factors, most people can purchase a non-owner policy for a few hundred dollars a year. Of course, high-risk drivers and those with a spotty driving record that includes multiple infractions will pay more.Most major car insurance companies offer non-owners policies. To ensure you get the best price, you can get a quote directly from different carriers to compare insurance rates, contact an insurance agent to shop around for you or use an online tool.Factors to consider when choosing a non-owners policyIf you decide to purchase non-owners insurance coverage, there are a few factors to consider:Coverage limits and deductibles. Since this coverage will be secondary in many situations, you may not want limits as high as if you owned a vehicle. On the other hand, you might prefer high coverage limits to give you maximum financial protection no matter what you drive.Provider reputation and financial stability. By analyzing consumer reviews and complaints, a carrier\u2019s reputation for processing claims, and even their financial stability (through agencies like AM Best), you can get a good idea of which auto insurance companies will pay out when necessary and remain solvent.Cost of premiums and payment options. Perhaps the biggest consideration when buying any insurance policy is the cost. It\u2019s important to balance the coverage options you choose with how much you can afford to spend. You may also want to see what payment options the carrier offers; some will allow you to pay premiums in monthly installments while others may offer a discount if you pay your full six-month premium upfront.No matter which insurance policy you choose, read your policy documents carefully to understand the terms, coverages and any exclusions.When non-owners car insurance may not be necessaryWith all this said, a non-owners insurance policy isn\u2019t right for everyone. In some cases, it may be insufficient while in others, this coverage could be redundant.Drivers who probably don\u2019t need to buy non-owners insurance include:Individuals who own a vehicle and already have a standard auto insurance policyDrivers who have regular access to a household vehicle and are listed as a named insured or allowed driver on another policyDrivers who use employer-provided coverage and only engage in business-related drivingThose with access to commercial car-sharing services or rental programs, which offer their own insurance protectionA non-owners auto insurance policy can be a great option for occasional drivers who don\u2019t own a vehicle, to provide added financial and personal protection each time you get behind the wheel of a borrowed or rented car. While this coverage is more limited than a standard auto policy, it can still offer you a combination of liability, medical payments, PIP and uninsured\/underinsured motorist protection to give you peace of mind on the road.","Article Anthor":"Stephanie Colestock","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"61":{"Article Title":"Can you change your student loan repayment plan?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/can-you-change-your-student-loan-repayment-plan-161131045.html","Article Content":"Federal student loans default to a standard repayment term of 10 years. But depending on your financial situation, you may want to adjust your repayment plan to make your monthly payment more affordable or to position yourself for student loan forgiveness.If you need a little more flexibility with your student loans, here's what you need to know.Can you change your student loan repayment plan?Yes, it's possible to change your student loan repayment plan, especially if you have federal student loans. Some of the reasons to consider adjusting your repayment plan include:Your income has decreased.Your expenses have increased.You're applying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness.You want to consolidate multiple loans into one.You're already on a longer repayment plan and want to pay off your debt more quickly.Federal student loan repayment plan optionsStudent loan repayment plans range from 10 to 30 years, with some tying your monthly payment to your income and household size. Here's a breakdown of the options that are available to you.Standard repayment planThe default repayment plan for federal student loans is 10 years. However, if you use the direct loan consolidation program to combine multiple loans into one, you can extend that to up to 30 years.The standard repayment plan is available to all federal loan borrowers, and you can even switch back to it if you've chosen a longer repayment plan in the past.Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loansDirect consolidation loansGraduated repayment planIf your income is low now, but you expect regular increases, the graduated repayment plan can be a good option. Payments start out low and increase, usually every two years, to ensure that you pay off the loan within 10 years \u2014 though you can go as long as 30 years with a consolidation loan.Anyone can apply for a graduated repayment plan. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loansDirect consolidation loansExtended repayment planIf you have more than $30,000 in outstanding federal direct loan debt, you can use the extended repayment plan to stretch your term to 25 years \u2014 payments can be fixed or graduated. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loansDirect consolidation loansSaving on a Valuable Education plan (SAVE)Formerly the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan, the SAVE plan is an income-driven repayment plan.On this plan, your monthly payments will be 5% of your discretionary income, which is the difference between your adjusted gross income (AGI) and 225% of the federal poverty guideline for your household size and state of residence.If your AGI is below that threshold, your monthly payment will be $0. What's more, if your resulting payment isn't enough to cover accruing interest on the loan, those charges won't be added to your balance.Finally, if your original loan balance was $12,000 or less, you qualify for forgiveness after 10 years on the SAVE plan. That timeline extends by one year for each additional $1,000 borrowed \u2014 for example, a $15,000 original balance qualifies for forgiveness after 13 years.If you were on the REPAYE plan before the student loan repayment pause began in March 2020, you'll be automatically enrolled in the SAVE plan. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansDirect PLUS loans made to studentsDirect consolidation loans that did not repay any PLUS loans made to parentsNote that if you have federal Stafford loans, you can consolidate them into the direct loan program and qualify.Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE)Under the PAYE plan, your monthly payments will be 10% of your discretionary income, which is the difference between your AGI and 150% of the federal poverty guideline. However, your payment is guaranteed to never be higher than your payment on the standard repayment plan.If you still have a balance after 20 years, the remaining amount will be forgiven. To qualify, you must be a new student loan borrower on or after Oct. 1, 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a direct loan on or after Oct. 1, 2011. You also typically need to have a high debt burden relative to your income. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansDirect PLUS loans made to studentsDirect consolidation loans that did not repay any PLUS loans made to parentsIncome-Based Repayment Plan (IBR)Another income-driven repayment plan, the IBR plan is designed for borrowers who have a high debt amount relative to their income.The plan reduces your monthly payment to 10% of your discretionary income \u2014 the difference between your AGI and 150% of the poverty guideline \u2014 if you received your first loans on or after July 1, 2014, and 15% if you received your first loan before that.Additionally, if you still have a balance after 20 years (or 25 if you received your first loan before July 1, 2014), the remaining amount will be forgiven. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansSubsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansDirect PLUS loans made to studentsDirect consolidation loans that did not repay any PLUS loans made to parentsIncome-Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR)The only income-driven repayment plan available to parents, the ICR plan reduces your monthly payment to the lesser of 20 percent of discretionary income \u2014 the difference between your AGI and 100% of the poverty guideline \u2014 or the amount you would pay on a repayment plan with a fixed payment over 12 years, adjusted according to your income.If you still have a student loan balance after 25 years, the remaining amount will be forgiven. Eligible loans include:Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loansDirect PLUS loans made to studentsDirect consolidation loans, including those that repaid PLUS loans made to parentsIncome-Sensitive Repayment Plan (ISR)If you have loans in the federal family education loan program (FFEL), which ended in 2010, your monthly payments will be based on your income \u2014 though the formula will depend on your lender \u2014 to ensure that your loan will be repaid within 15 years.Eligible loans include:Subsidized and unsubsidized federal Stafford loansFFEL PLUS loansFFEL consolidation loansWhat is the best student loan repayment plan?Ultimately, the best student loan repayment plan depends on your situation and financial goals. Here are some potential scenarios to consider:You have a high income: The standard repayment plan may be the best option for you because it's the quickest path to becoming debt-free.You're struggling to keep up with payments: An income-driven repayment plan may be the better choice. Because the new SAVE plan offers a chance at the lowest monthly payment and the quickest path to forgiveness for borrowers with lower debt amounts, it's best to start there to see what yours will look like.You're a parent: If you took out parent PLUS loans and you're having trouble making payments, consider consolidating your loans, so you can qualify for the ICR plan.You're applying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness: The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers complete forgiveness after you make 120 qualifying monthly payments while working for a government agency or eligible not-for-profit organization. If you're applying, get on an income-driven repayment plan, so you don't risk paying off your debt before you meet the requirements. Compare monthly payments between the SAVE, PAYE and IBR plans to determine the best fit for you.How to change your student loan repayment planTo get more information about your options and switch to a new student loan repayment plan, contact your loan servicer. To find your loan servicer and its contact information, log in to your account at StudentAid.gov or check your latest statement.Before you do so, however, you can use the online federal student loan simulator to get an idea of which plans you're eligible for and what your monthly payment will look like.Can you change your private student loan repayment plan?Generally, you can't change your repayment plan on a private student loan once you've been approved. However, you can refinance your loans with another private lender, which can allow you to choose a new repayment term.That said, you'll typically need good or excellent credit and a strong income to qualify for favorable terms on a student refinance loan. Otherwise, you may not get an interest rate that's low enough to make the process worth it, even with a different repayment plan.","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Mon, Sep 11, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"62":{"Article Title":"How to switch car insurance companies","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-to-switch-car-insurance-194505669.html","Article Content":"If the idea of switching to a new car insurance company has crossed your mind in recent months, you\u2019re not alone. Almost one-third of auto insurance customers in the United States experienced a rate increase in the past year, according to J.D. Power, leaving consumers deeply dissatisfied with their car insurance costs.The good news is that if you\u2019re unhappy with your current insurer, you can change your auto insurance at any time. Below are some simple steps you can follow to change car insurance carriers, along with the pros and cons of making a change.General considerations before leaving your current providerPerhaps the most common reason customers switch insurers is to get a better rate. However, you might also be motivated to shop for new auto insurance due to different coverage needs or for customer service reasons.Before you begin to gather quotes and compare rates from different insurers, it\u2019s important to assess the types of car insurance you have (e.g., liability insurance, collision insurance, comprehensive insurance, etc.). You should also review the coverage amounts you carry on your current policy and your deductibles. From there, you can evaluate if the coverage you have satisfies your current needs or if you want to consider new coverage options.Be thorough in your research of any new car insurance companies you consider. Make sure your new insurance provider is reputable and reliable.Reasons and timing for switching car insuranceWhether you\u2019ve been with your current insurance provider for years or months, you can switch car insurance companies whenever you like. Certain times may be more convenient than others, and some life events may prompt you to switch.You may want to consider changing car insurance companies if:Your renewal date is approaching: Switching insurance providers on your old policy\u2019s expiration date could be ideal. This strategy might help you avoid cancellation fees, having to pay for double coverage, and waiting for refunds on the former policy.You\u2019re adding or removing a driver: Anytime you need to add a driver to your policy, especially a teen driver, it\u2019s worth seeing if a competitor can offer you a lower rate. Removing a driver may also be a good time to switch auto insurance providers. As your insurance needs change, you might find more affordable or better coverage elsewhere.You purchase a home: When you buy a home, you\u2019ll most likely buy a homeowners policy at the same time. Many insurance providers offer discounts to customers who bundle their homeowners and auto insurance policies. (The same may be true for renters insurance.) So, if you\u2019re shopping for a new insurance policy for your home, it may be a good time to think about switching your car insurance coverage too.You move to a new city or state: Insurance rates can vary widely from one location to another. Furthermore, different states often have different insurance companies doing business. Anytime you relocate, it could be a good time to see if a different insurance carrier might be able to offer you a better rate based on your new location.Switching insurance providers in the middle of a coverage period has the potential to save you money or upgrade your coverage. But be careful not to cancel your original auto insurance policy too soon when changing carriers. It\u2019s better to pay for an extra month of coverage on your existing policy than to risk a lapse in coverage\u2014aka being without any insurance coverage before your new policy kicks in.Ready to change? Here\u2019s howWhen you\u2019re ready, the process of switching your policy should be simple. Here are three easy steps to follow.1. Shop around for new rates. Compare car insurance rates and premiums from multiple insurance companies before you make a change in coverage. You can call around for car insurance quotes, contact an insurance agent to shop new policies on your behalf, or use online tools to search for the best rates based on your details (e.g., location, vehicle, coverage needs, etc.). Don\u2019t forget to look for available car insurance discounts that might help you save even more.2. Establish a new policy. Once you find an offer for auto insurance coverage that you like, you can move forward with setting up a new policy. Be sure to read over the details (both coverage amounts and rate) to make sure they match your quote. Your new auto insurance provider may also have forms that you need to sign and you may need to put down a deposit to establish new coverage. Be sure to obtain proof of insurance from your new provider.3. Cancel your old policy. Before you contact your old insurance company to cancel your old auto policy, it\u2019s important to verify that your new auto insurance is active. If you skip this step, you risk having a gap in coverage that could result in penalties from your state. Note that if you\u2019re switching in the middle of a coverage period, your old insurance company might owe you a partial refund. However, you could also owe an early cancellation penalty depending on the terms of your policy.4. Update your lender. When you lease or finance a vehicle, you agree to maintain car insurance as part of your loan or lease agreement. So it\u2019s important to notify the lender or leasing company when you change auto insurance providers. You might face negative consequences (and even a potential repossession in extreme circumstances) if your lender believes your vehicle is uninsured.When to think twice about changing insuranceAlthough you always want to have the best rate for your coverage, in certain situations it could be wise to wait before changing insurance companies.During an active insurance claimAlthough you can typically change car insurance companies at any time, switching providers in the middle of an active insurance claim isn\u2019t ideal.When you switch insurance companies during the claims process, you might experience:Future rate increase: A new insurance provider may have a hard time properly pricing your new policy during an outstanding claim. Until your claim is complete, the company won\u2019t have all the information it needs to assess your risk level as a customer (aka the risk of you filing a new claim that would cost the insurer money). In this situation, you might face a significant premium increase when your policy renews.Policy cancellation: There\u2019s also a risk that your new provider might decide to cancel your new car insurance policy after your claim is complete. If you were dishonest or failed to inform the company about an outstanding at-fault claim, a policy cancellation may be more likely to occur. In extreme circumstances of insurance fraud, the insurance company might take legal action against you.If you do change car insurance providers in the middle of a claim, you\u2019ll still have to deal with your original insurance company until the claim is finalized. In general, it\u2019s best to wait until any outstanding claims are resolved before you switch to a new provider.After a DUI or accidentIf you\u2019ve had a series of at-fault accidents or a DUI conviction, it may be more challenging to find auto insurance companies that are willing to work with you (or to offer you competitive car insurance premiums).If you\u2019re in this situation, you should start researching auto insurance providers in your area that specialize in high-risk insurance (sometimes called SR-22 insurance) ASAP. Your current provider may increase your premiums significantly at your next renewal date \u2014 or drop you altogether.But even with a DUI or accidents on your driving record, you can take steps to reduce your insurance rates in the future. First, avoiding issues like additional DUI convictions, speeding, at-fault accidents, or lapses in insurance coverage is key. Taking a safe driving course might help you receive discounts from some insurance providers. And in some (though not all) states, DUI records may come off your driving record after five to 10 years.Canceling your old insuranceAfter you establish a new insurance policy (and confirm that it\u2019s effective and you have your new insurance ID cards), it\u2019s important to notify your former insurance company. You should submit a cancellation request in writing, but it\u2019s fine to follow up with a phone call as well. If you don\u2019t cancel your existing insurance coverage, you could wind up paying for two car insurance policies at once.(On the other hand, if you cancel your previous policy before the new one is fully in place your driver\u2019s license could be canceled by your state DMV if it looks like you\u2019re going without coverage. Make sure your new company notifies the state that you have the required coverage.)It\u2019s also worth noting that you might have to pay early cancellation fees or penalties if you change insurers before your current policy expires. Nonetheless, you can typically switch insurance companies in the middle of a coverage period as long as you give your provider proper notice.","Article Anthor":"Michelle Lambright Black","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 8, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"63":{"Article Title":"How does your ZIP code affect your car insurance?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/does-zip-code-affect-car-insurance-191204288.html","Article Content":"Auto insurance companies use a number of criteria to determine car insurance rates. The type of vehicle you drive, your driving history, and the amount of coverage you desire all come into play.Insurers also use your ZIP code when issuing car insurance policies because where you live is associated with a particular level of risk. Areas with heavy congestion or bad road conditions can lead to increased car accidents. High-crime areas are also seen as risky to insurers because there can be a greater chance of you filing an auto theft claim.These are just a few examples of how an increased risk associated with your ZIP code can lead to higher auto insurance rates. The opposite is also true. If you live within a ZIP code that\u2019s viewed as less risky to insure, you may benefit from lower rates.Why is your ZIP code important for insurance?Auto insurance companies want to make sure they are collecting more money in premiums than they are paying out in claims. If where you live is seen as having a greater likelihood of you filing auto insurance claims, the insurance company will typically give you a higher auto insurance rate to offset the money they may potentially need to pay out in claims.While the particular city and state you live in can help determine that risk, your ZIP code gives insurance companies a more specific picture of the risks that come along with insuring you.However, some states \u2013 including California and Michigan \u2013 have laws that prohibit insurance companies from using ZIP codes as a rating factor.Take note of garaging addressWhen you\u2019re working with an insurance agent or trying to get a policy quote online, you may come across the term \"garaging address.\" Your garaging address is simply the primary place where your vehicle will be parked overnight \u2013 even if it\u2019s not actually in a garage.Insurers use your garaging address in the same way they use your ZIP code. Knowing the primary location for your vehicle helps auto insurance providers evaluate the risk associated with insuring your car.How insurance companies use ZIP codes to determine riskAuto insurance underwriters use the statistical data associated with your ZIP code to determine the risk of insuring your vehicle where you live.Some of the risk factors they might consider include:Average claims history in that ZIP codePopulation densityTraffic patternsAccident ratesRoad conditionsNatural disastersCrime rateThe amount of uninsured motoristsCost of livingNow, let\u2019s dive a bit deeper into these location-related risk factors.8 risk factors for car insurance that vary by locationIf you live in an urban area, chances are you\u2019re going to face higher car insurance prices than if you were to pack up and move to a rural area. Busy cities tend to have more people on the road causing accidents and higher crime rates, which might have insurance companies shelling out more money for instances of car theft or vandalism.Here\u2019s what else insurance companies look at when determining the cost of car insurance premiums.1. Claims historyThe amount of auto insurance claims filed within your ZIP code can affect your premium. If drivers in your ZIP code tend to file more car insurance claims than average, insurance underwriters might issue more expensive policies.2. Population densityMore people living in an area generally leads to more cars on the road, more traffic congestion and higher accident rates. Auto insurance policies tend to be more expensive in high-density areas as a result.On the other hand, ZIP codes with a low population density usually have less occurrences of car accidents, and auto insurance policies in those areas tend to be cheaper.3. Traffic patternsAnother factor that impacts car accidents \u2013 and thus, auto insurance claims \u2013 within a ZIP code is traffic patterns.Roads with high speed limits, curvy roads with visibility issues, complicated intersections and unclear signage can all lead to higher rates of traffic accidents. Insurance companies would view those areas as riskier than places where traffic patterns promote safer driving outcomes.4. Road conditionsThe conditions of the roads themselves can affect your probability of filing auto insurance claims. Roads with potholes, rough surfaces, and debris can end up damaging vehicles or causing car accidents as drivers attempt to avoid the unsafe road conditions.Streets that flood easily during rain showers and roads that quickly turn icy in frigid temperatures are also hazardous and may lead to more accidents or vehicle damage. ZIP codes with many roads in poor or potentially dangerous conditions are considered more risky and can wind up costing drivers more in auto insurance premiums.5. Natural disastersLiving in regions prone to natural disasters \u2013 including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, and blizzards \u2013 can increase insurance costs because insurance companies typically have to pay out more money in claims following such an event. In an attempt to balance out the probability for increased claims, drivers in those areas typically have to pay more in insurance premiums.6. Crime rates and vandalismZIP codes with higher crime rates \u2013 particularly when it comes to auto theft or auto vandalism \u2013 are viewed as riskier to auto insurance companies.7. Amount of uninsured motoristsIf your ZIP code tends to have more uninsured motorists illegally on the roads, you can probably expect to pay more for your auto policy. If your vehicle is hit by an uninsured driver, there\u2019s no insurance company to cover auto repairs or medical bills you might have as a result.8. Cost of livingPerhaps surprisingly, even cost of living can have an impact on your auto insurance premiums. If you live in an expensive ZIP code, you can likely expect to pay more at the auto body shop following an accident. The cost of medical care might also be higher than average.Insurance companies footing your repair bills or doctors\u2019 bills can expect to pay more when claims are filed in high cost-of-living areas.How your location can affect your car insurance coverageYour auto insurance premiums are also affected by laws that set minimum coverage requirements in your state.For example, drivers in Texas are required to have liability insurance that covers $30,000 per person for injuries, $60,000 total for all injuries and $25,000 for property damage per accident. In Iowa, drivers must have liability coverage at $20,000 per person for injuries, $40,000 total for all injuries, and $15,000 for property damage.More coverage typically means higher car insurance costs for the driver.Even if your state doesn\u2019t require it, you may choose to purchase more coverage \u2013 such as comprehensive coverage or collision coverage \u2013 so that you feel confident you won\u2019t have to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket costs if you were to get into a car accident.Additionally, some states \u2013 including Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York, plus a few more \u2013 are no-fault car insurance states, meaning your insurance company pays injury-related expenses after a car accident regardless of who was at fault.Insurance policies for drivers in these no-fault car insurance states tend to be higher, because you can never count on another driver\u2019s insurance company to pay for the costs associated with the car accident, even if they technically caused the accident.Other factors that affect car insurance ratesWhere you live is not the only factor that car insurance companies evaluate when issuing policies and setting insurance rates. Your vehicle type, driving history, age, and even your credit score are other determinants that can either place you in a preferred risk category or a high-risk category.Driving record and accident historyWhile you don\u2019t have control over things like population density or the crime rate in your area, you do have some control over your own driving record. Practicing safe driving habits can reduce your chance of accidents on the road.Car insurers view drivers who have no car accidents, DUIs or traffic tickets on their record as being less risky to insure.Credit scoreStudies have shown there\u2019s a correlation between credit score and the probability of filing car insurance claims. Drivers with excellent credit \u2013 known as credit-based insurance scores \u2013 tend to file fewer car insurance claims, while those with poor credit typically file more claims.Vehicle typeThe type of car you drive also impacts what you\u2019ll pay in auto insurance. The costlier your car is to repair or replace \u2013 or the increased likelihood that it\u2019d be a target for car thieves \u2013 the harder it will be to find cheap car insurance.Vehicle usageHow you use your vehicle is another thing insurance underwriters may consider. You\u2019ll typically pay less if you don\u2019t drive your car much compared to others who have long commutes or take frequent road trips.Navigating ZIP code-related challengesLiving in a ZIP code that insurers deem risky doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re guaranteed to have to pay high auto insurance premiums. Here are six tips for getting affordable auto insurance in high-risk areas.1. Maintain stellar driving habitsPractice safe driving to avoid car accidents, so you can build up a history of no insurance claims. Taking a defensive driving course can also help you get lower car insurance rates.2. Improve your credit scoreInsurance companies correlate good credit with the likelihood of filing fewer auto insurance claims. Boost your credit history by paying bills on time and making increased debt payments.3. Compare car insurance quotes from multiple companiesAlways get quotes from multiple car insurance companies, so you can consider your options and nail down the best deal. You can work with insurance agents to help you compare costs or use online insurance calculators that give you a side-by-side comparison.4. Ask for available discountsMost major auto insurance companies offer discounts for things like bundling your auto and homeowners insurance, being a safe driver or enrolling in paperless billing with auto-pay. Contact your insurance company to ask about which discounts you might qualify for.5. Re-evaluate your coverage needsIf you have an older, paid-off vehicle and enough savings to cover repairs, you might not need full coverage on your vehicle. Assess your situation to determine the coverage levels you truly need.6. Adjust your deductible amountYour deductible \u2013 the amount of money you\u2019ll pay out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2013 affects the cost of your insurance premiums. Generally, if you opt for a high deductible, you\u2019ll pay a lower premium. However, you need to be prepared to pay out of pocket for any repair bills or medical bills if you get in a car accident.","Article Anthor":"Nicole Dow","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 8, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"64":{"Article Title":"Buying a car? Here\u2019s how to shop for insurance","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/new-car-insurance-155946669.html","Article Content":"When you buy a car, you\u2019ll need new car insurance, whether you\u2019re sourcing a new policy or transferring existing coverage.Buying a new or used vehicle can be exciting. After you\u2019re done selecting the perfect set of wheels, you\u2019ll need to focus on the less-exciting part: getting insurance for your new vehicle.The state you live in will require you to carry a minimum amount of car insurance. And if you finance or lease your new vehicle, the lender will require you to carry sufficient insurance to protect its investment as well.In some cases, you may be able to add your new car to your current policy. But if you didn\u2019t trade or sell your former vehicle, you\u2019ll need to add the new car to your existing policy or set up new coverage elsewhere.Below are helpful tips on how to insure a car that\u2019s new to you. You\u2019ll also discover how to compare car insurance coverage options and find the best deals for your situation.Can you switch insurance to a new car?When you buy a new vehicle, your existing car insurance should cover it at first \u2014 usually with the same level of coverage you have on your old car. For this reason, an auto dealership may allow you to drive a new purchase off the lot if you show proof of current insurance and sign a form committing to insure the vehicle.Yet even in this scenario, you won\u2019t have long to get a new policy in place.If you want to stick with your existing insurer, you should notify your insurance company as soon as possible after purchasing a vehicle. Some insurers may give you a grace period to add a new vehicle to your policy (such as if you buy a new car over the weekend). But if a grace period isn\u2019t available, you\u2019ll need to add your new car to your policy before leaving the dealership.If you trade in or sell your old car, you may be able to transfer your existing insurance coverage to your new vehicle. But remember to review the coverage options on your existing policy before making the change. Your former selections may not be the right fit for your new car. So it\u2019s important to reassess how much car insurance you need now.It\u2019s also wise to compare insurance quotes, policy options, and potential insurance discounts from several different providers. Rate shopping can help you make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal for the type of coverage you want.If you\u2019re confident that your current provider is offering a rate and amount of coverage that makes sense for your new vehicle purchase, you can move forward.When you transfer coverage to a new vehicle, your premium will likely change since the value of your new vehicle will differ from your old one. This is true even if you don\u2019t adjust coverage amounts. Of course, if you change the types of insurance you carry (e.g., adding comprehensive car insurance when you had only liability coverage before) or the deductible on your insurance policy, those adjustments will affect your premium as well.Insuring a new car without previous coverageSome drivers may need to establish brand new car insurance when purchasing a vehicle. If you\u2019re in this position, it\u2019s important to secure adequate insurance before you drive your new car for the first time \u2014 even if you\u2019re paying in cash. If you attempt to drive without car insurance, you could put yourself at risk financially or worse, be in violation of state laws.How to get car insurance before you buy a carIt\u2019s illegal to drive without insurance. But you can set up insurance coverage before you own a vehicle, such as a non-owner policy or insurance for the type of car you plan to purchase.As an alternative, you could also apply for a temporary car insurance binder before you purchase a new vehicle. A binder is a document you request from an insurer that serves as proof of insurance to lenders. This document can also satisfy legal insurance requirements until your formal auto policy is approved.When you contact an insurance agent and reach out to carriers directly to set up coverage for the first time, the car insurance quotes you receive will vary based on the type of coverage included. Here are some of the most common coverage options:Liability insurance\u00a0pays for damage you cause to other vehicles along with medical expenses for drivers and passengers when you\u2019re at fault in an accident. In almost all states, you need a minimum amount of liability coverage to legally drive.Comprehensive insurance is optional coverage that pays for certain types of damages to your personal vehicle that don\u2019t involve a collision (e.g. theft, vandalism, storm damage, etc.). If you finance or lease your vehicle, the lender will typically require you to carry this type of coverage.Collision insurance can cover the cost of repairing or replacing your personal vehicle if someone steals it or you\u2019re in an accident. If you finance or lease your vehicle, the lender will typically require you to carry this type of coverage.Personal injury protection (PIP) insurance can help pay for medical bills for yourself and your passengers in the event of a covered accident.Full coverage car insurance is an unofficial term to describe an auto insurance policy package including liability, comprehensive, and collision coverage \u2014 sometimes more. In states where it\u2019s required by law, full coverage also includes uninsured motorist coverage that kicks in when you\u2019re in an accident with someone lacking enough coverage.The effective date of your new insurance typically begins as soon as you make your first payment. (Note: Depending on the date you purchase your policy and the insurer\u2019s requirements, you might have to make two months worth of premium payments upfront.)This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Tips for getting the best car insurance for your new carInsuring a new vehicle may feel a bit overwhelming at first. These tips can help you make sure you get the coverage you need while keeping your insurance costs down.Shop around: Whatever type of insurance you decide to buy, it\u2019s smart to get quotes from multiple insurance companies. Comparing auto insurance quotes (just as you should during the car shopping process) can be a great way to find affordable car insurance.Assess your coverage needs: Your insurance needs for a new car may differ from an older vehicle. Consider the value of your new vehicle (or the vehicle you plan to purchase) and how you plan to use the new car. A car you drive every day may require different coverage than a vehicle that will sit in your driveway most of the time. (Vehicles used in ridesharing have additional requirements.)Understand your state\u2019s minimum car insurance requirements and coverage limits: Most states require you to carry basic liability insurance that covers other drivers if an accident takes place. But the minimum coverage limits (often noted as 25\/50\/25, or at least $25,000 per person you injure, $50,000 in injuries per accident, and $25,000 in property damage per accident) may not be enough to financially protect you in a major accident.Determine whether you need gap insurance: If you finance or lease your new car, your lender will probably require you to have gap insurance, which covers the gap between what the insurer would have to pay for your totaled or stolen vehicle and what you still owe on your auto loan. It\u2019ll cost you a bit extra but save you from having to lay out cash for the balance of your loan if your car were totaled in an accident.Consider additional coverage: If you finance or lease your new car, the lender will require you to carry comprehensive and collision coverage. But even if you pay cash for your new purchase, you may want to consider adding on this additional coverage to protect your own financial investment. Extra features like roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement are also nice to have.Look for discounts: Many insurance companies offer discounts that can save you money. Bundling coverage (using the same company where you have homeowners or renters insurance), taking a defensive driving course, getting credit for good grades, or signing up for a telematics device to track your mileage are all discount opportunities. It\u2019s also a good idea to look at the customer satisfaction ratings of any company you consider.Important documentation and information your insurer needsWhen you set up new car insurance (or switch your existing coverage over to a new vehicle), your insurance company will need some basic information, such as:Vehicle identification number (VIN)Title informationFinancing or leasing detailsDriver\u2019s licenseVehicle inspection or appraisal (in certain circumstances)If you\u2019re establishing a new insurance policy, the insurer may also review your credit (depending on your state of residence). In many states, your credit-based insurance score can impact the price you pay for auto insurance. Good credit has the potential to lower your car insurance rates while bad credit could make it more expensive to insure your vehicle.","Article Anthor":"Michelle Lambright Black","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 8, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"65":{"Article Title":"How the Fed affects student loan interest rates","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/student-loan-interest-rates-212638277.html","Article Content":"Student loan interest rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. But exactly how the Fed's decision to raise or lower its federal funds rate affects you depends on the type of student loans and interest rate you have.If you're concerned about rising interest rates or simply want to better understand how student loan interest works, here's what you need to know.How does the Federal Reserve influence student loan interest rates?One of the purposes of the Federal Reserve is to help manage inflation in the U.S. economy. One way the central bank does this is by raising and lowering its federal funds rate \u2014 commercial banks charge this rate when lending to each other to meet overnight cash reserve requirements.When the inflation rate exceeds the Fed's 2% target and remains elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 made up of the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors and select Reserve Bank presidents \u2014 may increase the federal funds rate.The prime rate, a benchmark rate that banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions use to determine interest rates for certain loans and credit cards, typically follows suit. As borrowing becomes more expensive, consumer spending typically decreases, resulting in the inflation rate coming back down.Conversely, if the inflation rate is too low and the economy is sputtering, the FOMC may lower its interest rate, reducing the cost of borrowing money, which can result in more spending to enhance economic growth.Federal student loan interest ratesThe federal funds rate doesn't directly impact federal student loan interest rates, but it can do so indirectly. Instead of using the prime rate, Congress determines interest rates for federal student loans each year using the 10-year Treasury bill, adding on a margin.The 10-year Treasury is not influenced by the federal funds rate. Instead, the yield on a 10-year Treasury bill is dictated by investor demand. When the inflation rate is high or investors anticipate high economic growth, they typically demand higher yields on long-term bonds, resulting in higher Treasury rates.On the flip side, Treasury rates typically fall when investors expect slow economic growth and prefer the safety of risk-free government bonds.If the FOMC successfully reduces inflation by manipulating the federal funds rate, the 10-year Treasury yield may also fall, resulting in lower federal student loan interest rates. Because federal student loans have fixed interest rates, the prime rate doesn't come into play, and your interest rate won't change after loan disbursement.Private student loan interest ratesPrivate student loans are offered by private lending institutions, which use the prime rate to help determine which interest rates to charge their borrowers. As the Fed's interest rate increases, so will the interest rates offered on private student loans, and vice versa.But because you can opt for either a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate on a private student loan, the Fed's decisions may impact you differently.If you opt for a fixed APR, your interest rate may be high if the federal funds rate is currently high, but it won't change over time. In contrast, variable interest rates fluctuate based on market rates. In other words, your interest rate can go up or down over time, depending on market conditions.Interest rates for different types of student loansEach year, Congress determines interest rates on federal student loans for the entire academic year by taking the 10-year Treasury rate on a specific date in May and adding a margin, which varies by loan type. On May 10, 2023, the 10-year Treasury note high yield was set at 3.448%, with the following margins.Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students: 10-year Treasury yield plus 2.05% (fixed interest rate of 5.50%)Direct Unsubsidized Loans for professional students and graduate students: 10-year Treasury yield plus 3.60% (fixed interest rate of 7.05%)Direct PLUS loans for parents of undergrads and for professional students and graduate students: 10-year Treasury yield plus 4.60% (fixed interest rate of 8.05%)These interest rates are standardized within each program. If you apply for financial aid with a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application and qualify for a federal student loan, you'll receive the same rate as everyone else who qualifies in the same year.On the other hand, private lenders determine interest rates using the prime rate and other benchmarks, as well as risk-based pricing. Instead of offering a standardized rate, they typically offer a range of interest rates, with the best student loan rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers and higher rates for borrowers with a higher risk of defaulting on payments.Current student loan interest ratesFor the 2023-24 school year, federal student loan interest rates are as follows:This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.As part of the Biden administration\u2019s coronavirus pandemic relief efforts, interest on federal student loans stopped accruing in March 2020. However, it resumed on Sept. 1, 2023, and monthly payments will resume in October 2023.Among private lenders, interest rates can vary depending on the lender, your creditworthiness and the type of interest rate you choose. That said, the average fixed interest rate among top private student loan companies is 9.62% for undergraduate loans and 9.51% for graduate loans, as of August 2023.Student loan debt repayment plansThe U.S. Department of Education offers several different repayment plans for federal student loan borrowers. The repayment plan you choose won't have any impact on your interest rate, but it can affect your total interest charges.The standard repayment plan on a federal student loan is 10 years, but if you extend it \u2014 options go as high as 30 years \u2014 you'll ultimately pay more interest over the life of your loan.If you're having trouble making payments on your federal student loans, you can opt for an income-driven repayment plan, which can reduce your monthly student loan payment to as little as 5% of your discretionary income. Depending on which plan you choose, you may also receive forgiveness of your remaining balance after a certain point, which can range from 10 to 25 years.However, if your monthly payment isn't high enough to cover the accrued interest, three of the four income-driven repayment plans will add the remaining interest to your balance. The SAVE plan is the only one that doesn't do this.Do credit scores and co-signers also affect your interest rate?You don't need a minimum credit score or a co-signer to qualify for federal student loans. However, if you're applying for private student loans, a bad credit score will likely prevent you from qualifying \u2014 you typically need a credit score in the mid-600s or higher to get approved.Just because you qualify doesn't mean you'll get favorable terms \u2014 student loan companies reserve their highest loan amounts and lowest rates for borrowers with credit scores in the mid-700s and higher.If you can't qualify for a private student loan on your own, or you can't get a low interest rate, you can improve your odds by adding a creditworthy co-signer to your application. A co-signer agrees to repay the loan if you can't, so the lender will also consider their credit score and income during the application process.If you don't have a potential co-signer, improving your credit score is your best bet to qualify for a lower rate on a private student loan. Steps you can take include:Checking your credit score to evaluate your overall credit health.Reviewing your credit reports to pinpoint areas you can address.Paying your bills on time and, if applicable, getting caught up on missed payments.Paying down high credit card balances.Paying off loans with low balances.Asking a loved one with good credit to add you as an authorized user on their credit card.Disputing inaccurate or fraudulent information on your credit reports.Will refinancing your student loans lower your interest rate?Student loan refinancing involves replacing your existing loans with a new one through a private lender. Depending on your situation, refinancing could allow you to get a lower interest rate or a different repayment plan. If you have several loans, you'll also be able to consolidate them into one monthly payment going forward.If you have private student loans and can qualify for better terms with a refinance loan, there aren't many downsides to refinancing. But if you have federal student loans, it's important to consider what you'll give up if you refinance them with a private lender. The process is irreversible and will result in you losing access to federal benefits, including student loan forgiveness and repayment assistance programs, income-driven repayment plans, and generous forbearance and deferment options.Unless you have a stable job and income and the potential savings are significant, it's best to avoid refinancing federal student loans.Will you save money with student loan refinancing?Student loan refinancing can help you secure a lower monthly payment through a lower interest rate, a longer repayment term or both. But in instances where your new repayment term will be higher, you may wind up paying more in interest.As an example, let's say you have $30,000 principal balance in private student loans with an average interest rate of 8%, a 10-year repayment term, and a monthly payment of roughly $364. If you qualify for a 6% interest rate and retain the 10-year repayment term, your new monthly payment will be about $333, and you'll save $3,711 in interest charges over the life of the loan.If you get the 6% interest rate and extend your repayment term to 15 years, your monthly payment will drop even further to roughly $253, but you'll end up paying about $1,890 more in interest on the new loan.In this instance, you'd need to consider the trade-offs of extending your loan term. If your budget is tight, a lower payment may be necessary but also more expensive in the long run. One way to mitigate the cost is to take advantage of the lower payment now, then once your financial situation has improved, refinance again with a shorter repayment term or make extra payments to pay off the debt faster.Other factors that affect student loan refinancing eligibilityPrivate lenders consider several different factors to determine your eligibility to qualify for student loan refinancing, including your:Credit scoreCredit historyOther debtIncomeGraduation statusBefore you apply with a lender, go through the pre-qualification process with multiple lenders to gauge your approval odds and get some rate quotes that you can compare. This process involves a soft credit check, which won't impact your credit score, and can give you the information you need to determine whether refinancing is the right move for you.","Article Anthor":"Ben Luthi","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 7, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"66":{"Article Title":"What is full coverage car insurance?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/full-coverage-car-insurance-205518763.html","Article Content":"Here's what you should know about full coverage car insurance and what it covers.When you\u2019re shopping for auto insurance, one option you\u2019ll see is full coverage. While no auto insurance policy covers everything, full coverage offers significant protection if you\u2019re involved in a car accident or your vehicle is damaged by weather, vandalism or another event.Here\u2019s what to know about full coverage car insurance, how it protects you financially, and whether it makes sense for you.What does it cover?Full coverage car insurance isn\u2019t one type of coverage; it typically includes three coverages \u2014 liability, collision, and comprehensive insurance.Liability insurance comprises two coverage types: property damage and bodily injury liability insurance. Property damage kicks in if your car damages someone else\u2019s property, such as their fence, mailbox or landscaping. The bodily injury component covers you if you hurt another driver or one of their passengers in an at-fault car accident.Collision insurance reimburses you for repairs to your own vehicle or replacement after an accident.Comprehensive insurance also covers the cost of car repairs or replacement, but there\u2019s an important difference. Instead of kicking in after an accident, comprehensive coverage pays when your car is damaged due to an event like severe weather, burglary, vandalism or a fire.While liability, collision, and comprehensive are common with full coverage insurance, you can add other coverage options to a full coverage policy. Some may even be mandatory, depending on your state requirements. Additional coverages include uninsured\/underinsured motorist coverage, gap insurance, and rental car reimbursement coverage.Here\u2019s what each covers:Underinsured\/uninsured motorist coverage: Protects you if the other party at fault in a car accident doesn\u2019t have enough insurance to cover your medical bills, car repairs and other expenses.Gap coverage: Protects you if your car is stolen or totaled and your remaining auto loan balance exceeds your car\u2019s depreciated value.Rental car reimbursement: If your car is damaged in a covered incident, this optional coverage helps out when you need to rent a car while yours is being repaired.Does full coverage cover at-fault accidents?Full coverage car insurance will offer some protection if you\u2019re found at fault in an accident. Your liability insurance protects other drivers and their passengers in this case. And your collision coverage will cover the repair or replacement of your vehicle no matter who\u2019s responsible for an accident.But there are some limitations and costs to be aware of. Your insurance company will only provide coverage up to the amounts specified in your policy, known as coverage limits. For instance, if you have $25,000 in bodily injury liability insurance, but another party is seriously injured and their medical expenses exceed that amount, you\u2019d likely have to pay the difference out of pocket.Insurance deductibles also apply with collision and comprehensive insurance. Your deductible is the amount you pay before your insurance kicks in. Deductible amounts vary by policy, but it\u2019s common to see $500 deductibles. So if your car\u2019s damage totals $4,000, you\u2019d need to pay $500 and your collision insurance would pay the rest.Is personal injury protection or medical payments coverage included?The answer: It depends where you live.Personal injury protection, or PIP, is wide-ranging insurance that pays for your medical bills and other healthcare expenses, as well as lost wages, funeral costs, in-home health care, house cleaning or transportation needs related to a car accident, regardless of whether the accident was your fault.Medical payments coverage, or MedPay, is similar: It covers your own injuries, or those of your passengers, no matter who is at fault in an accident. It also pays for medical expenses if you were injured as a pedestrian or in someone else\u2019s car. But it doesn\u2019t cover things like lost wages or childcare expenses.PIP is required in 15 states, so in those places it\u2019s included in full coverage. MedPay is required in only three states for drivers who opt out of standard coverage. It\u2019s more typically an add-on.Do I need full coverage auto insurance on my car?Different states have different insurance requirements; nearly all require that you carry a minimum amount of bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. But none mandate full coverage.That said, your lender may require collision and comprehensive if you\u2019re financing your vehicle. Because your car serves as collateral for your auto loan, lenders want to ensure that collateral is protected in an accident.You'll pay more for full coverage than a liability-only car insurance policy, but it also offers more peace of mind \u2014 and financial protection. For instance, if a large tree limb crushes your vehicle, the comprehensive insurance included with your full coverage policy would cover its replacement cost. If you had a liability-only policy, you\u2019d have to pay for a new car out of pocket.Is a full policy the right coverage for you? That depends on the age, make and model of your vehicle, as well as your risk tolerance. If you drive an older, low-value car, dropping to liability-only coverage could make sense if your full coverage deductible and monthly premiums exceed your car\u2019s value. Likewise, if you don\u2019t drive your older car often, the risk of damage to your car decreases, so having collision and comprehensive may not make sense.Evaluate your preferred level of risk, your budget, and your insurance costs when determining if a liability-only or full coverage policy makes sense for your situation. And be sure to shop around for car insurance quotes to ensure you get the best rate.","Article Anthor":"Jess Ullrich","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 7, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"67":{"Article Title":"What you need to know about car insurance deductibles","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/car-insurance-deductible-192739818.html","Article Content":"A deductible makes car insurance premiums cheaper. In return for a lower premium, you agree to pay the first part of any costs to repair your vehicle for damage that you cause.Deductibles typically apply to collision and comprehensive insurance \u2014 the physical damage coverages that pay to repair your own car \u2014 but not to liability insurance, which pays for damages or injuries you cause to someone else.Deductibles vary, but the amount you choose may have a meaningful impact on your finances. A high deductible can reduce the amount you pay each month or each year in premiums. A low deductible means filing a claim results in little out-of-pocket expense.Here\u2019s what you need to know about auto insurance deductibles, how they work, and the impact they can have on your insurance premiums and coverage.What is an insurance deductible?Your deductible is the amount of money you\u2019re responsible for paying out of your own pocket for car repairs or other covered losses when your insurance company approves a claim.Car insurance policies may set different deductibles for different types of car insurance. For example, your insurance policy might include a separate collision deductible (i.e., coverage for accidents), a comprehensive deductible (i.e., coverage for losses not related to collisions), and in some cases a personal injury deductible.You have to meet your deductible before your insurance policy will begin to pay on a claim. For example, let\u2019s say your car is damaged by a falling tree limb and needs $1,500 worth of repairs. If you have a $500 deductible, you\u2019ll pay that amount first and then your collision coverage will cover the remaining $1,000.Deductibles affect the cost of your insurance premiums. Insurance policies with higher deductibles typically have lower premiums. But if you set your deductible too low and get into a wreck, you risk having to pay for more of the repair costs yourself.How does a car insurance deductible work?When you set up auto insurance coverage, it\u2019s up to you to choose the amount for your car insurance deductible. According to the Insurance Information Institute (III), the typical deductible amount on an auto insurance policy is either $500 or $1,000. However, they can range from $0 to $2,500.Here\u2019s an example of how a car insurance deductible works: Let\u2019s say your car is damaged by a falling tree limb and needs $1,500 worth of repairs. If you have a $500 deductible, you\u2019ll pay that amount first and then your collision coverage will cover the remaining $1,000.Your deductible generally applies each time you file a claim against your auto insurance policy \u2014 just like a copay on a health insurance policy. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if your policy includes comprehensive coverage, your insurer might waive the deductible if you need chips or cracks in your windshield repaired.Factors to consider when choosing a deductibleThere\u2019s a direct correlation between your car insurance deductible and the cost of your car insurance premium. And it can be difficult to find the perfect balance between the two.A higher deductible could save you money on a monthly basis (or bi-annual or annual basis if you pay in advance). By contrast, a lower deductible can help you recover faster in the event of an accident.Your goal should be to figure out the best car insurance deductible for your situation. The following questions may help.Do you have emergency savings to cover repairs and other costs? With a higher deductible, you\u2019ll have to cover a bigger portion of any repair bills that arise. If that\u2019s a concern, a lower deductible is probably better.Is your household budget tight? If so, a higher deductible could help you save on your insurance premium. (Just make sure you can afford the deductible if necessary.)Have you been in car accidents or do you file other types of auto insurance claims often? If the answer is no, a higher deductible might not expose you to as many out-of-pocket costs as it could be for other drivers.Are you comfortable with the financial risk that a higher deductible represents? If risk makes you nervous, a lower deductible might be better for your peace of mind.What is the value of your vehicle? If the insured vehicle\u2019s value is low, a low deductible policy might make sense. However, the opposite could also be true.Like a deductible, insurance coverage limits can also impact premium costs. An insurance limit is the maximum amount your insurance policy will pay for a covered claim. If you\u2019re involved in an accident (or another covered event) that results in losses that exceed your coverage limit, you\u2019re responsible for paying those costs yourself as well.You can find details about your deductibles and insurance limits on the first page of your car insurance policy. This section is called the declarations page, and you can ask your insurance provider for a copy if you can\u2019t locate yours.Pros and cons of high and low deductiblesBelow are some of the advantages and disadvantages of both high and low car insurance deductibles to consider.Pros of high deductiblesHigh-deductible insurance plans tend to feature lower premiums. As a result, these policies may be more affordable.People who don\u2019t file claims could see the savings add up over time with a high-deductible, low premium policy.Cons of high deductiblesYou might have to put off getting your vehicle repaired if you don\u2019t have the cash available to cover your portion of the bill.A lender may not allow you to choose a high-deductible option if your vehicle is financed.Pros of low deductiblesYou pay less out of pocket for covered damages, repairs, and losses with a low-deductible insurance policy.A low deductible may help reduce stress about the unknown.The insurance company assumes more upfront risk in the event of a covered claim.Cons of low deductiblesA low car insurance deductible often translates to higher premiums, which could put added strain on your budget.You might be tempted to file claims for minor damages when your deductible is low, and frequent claims could lead to premium increases by your insurance provider.Remember, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to car insurance deductibles. Instead, your goal should be to find the right balance for your individual needs.How deductibles affect premiumsIf you want to save money on your car insurance premium, raising your deductible might accomplish that goal. Decreasing your deductible, on the other hand, could have the opposite effect. Yet, while these general rules tend to hold true across the board, the exact costs can vary between insurance providers, your state, and from one driver to the next.Below is a hypothetical example from Progressive that demonstrates how the deductible amount you select could impact your auto insurance costs.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Keep in mind that deductibles are one way to manage insurance premiums costs but not the only option. There are other smart strategies that could help you maintain affordable car insurance premiums as well:Keep a clean driving recordLook for car insurance discountsImprove your creditShop around regularly for better ratesBundle your car insurance with your homeowners insurance or renters policyAs time passes, your insurance premiums may naturally decline with age.Managing deductibles in insurance claimsWhether your insurance policy has a deductible of $0 or $2,500, the claim filing process begins the same way. If your vehicle is involved in a covered accident, you\u2019ll typically want to contact your insurance company as soon as possible to file a claim. You should provide your insurer with any key information you gathered at the scene of the accident \u2014 contact information of the other driver(s) involved, pictures you may have taken, details from the police report, etc.Next, your car insurance company will most likely assign an adjuster to investigate and manage your claim. The adjuster is responsible for communicating with you, other insurance companies, repair facilities, witnesses, and any other parties. They will also review any estimates that you or the repair shops you visit provide.If your adjuster approves your repair estimate, it will issue a check to you or the repair shop. Remember, your insurance company will subtract any deductible you\u2019re responsible for paying from this claim check.Personal injury protection deductiblesDepending on the state where you live, you might have to carry personal injury protection, or PIP insurance, as part of your car insurance coverage. PIP insurance can help cover the cost of medical expenses, lost wages, funeral expenses, and other covered costs for drivers and passengers, regardless of who was at fault in an auto accident.If you carry PIP insurance (as a requirement of your state or on a voluntary basis), this coverage might feature a separate deductible. Just remember, if that coverage includes a separate deductible, your insurer would subtract that amount from any claim check before issuing it to you as well.","Article Anthor":"Michelle Lambright Black","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 7, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"68":{"Article Title":"What is term life insurance?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/what-is-term-life-insurance-170452904.html","Article Content":"Term life insurance is a type of life insurance contract that only pays a death benefit if the insured person dies within a specific period. If the person doesn\u2019t pass away during the term, the policy expires and doesn\u2019t pay a benefit.Purchasing a term life policy is a surprisingly affordable way to provide financial protection for your loved ones. Read on to learn how term life insurance works, the pros and cons, and what to consider before buying a policy.What is term life insurance and how does it work?A term life insurance policy is pretty simple to understand. When you apply for a policy, you\u2019ll determine how much coverage you need, as well as the policy\u2019s term, i.e., the length. Typical terms are 10, 20, and 30 years. You\u2019ll pay premiums to the life insurance company during the term to keep the policy in force, usually monthly or annually.If you die during the term, your insurance company will pay out the policy\u2019s death benefit to your beneficiaries. The death benefit is paid in a lump sum that\u2019s tax-free for your loved ones. But if you\u2019re still alive at the end of the term, the policy expires without paying a benefit.Most policies nowadays are level-term policies, meaning they pay the same death benefit no matter when the death occurs during the term of coverage. With a decreasing term policy, the death benefit gets smaller as the policyholder ages.Term life insurance is sometimes referred to as pure life insurance because its sole purpose is to provide a payout to your beneficiaries if you die during the term. There\u2019s no cash value, which is a savings account-like feature of permanent life insurance policies.Term vs. whole life insuranceThere are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance. Whole life insurance is the most common type of permanent life insurance.There are two major differences between term and whole life insurance:Term life insurance only pays a death benefit if you die during the specified term, whereas whole life insurance offers a guaranteed death benefit for your entire life.Whole life insurance has a savings component called cash value that you can take loans or withdrawals from while you\u2019re alive, but term life insurance has no cash value. Term life offers only life insurance coverage, while whole life insurance is a hybrid product with insurance and savings\/investment features.Because of the lifetime coverage and cash value component, whole life premiums are far more expensive than term life premiums. Whole life premiums can be anywhere from five to 15 times higher than 20- or 30-year term life premiums with the same amount of coverage.Benefits of term life insuranceTerm life insurance coverage offers many benefits, the most important being financial protection for your loved ones. Some advantages include:AffordabilityTerm life insurance premiums are far more affordable than other types of life insurance policies with similar death benefits. Dollar-for-dollar, your term life premiums will buy you a much larger death benefit than you\u2019d find with permanent life insurance.The amount you\u2019ll pay will vary based on your age, gender, health conditions, occupation and whether you\u2019re a smoker. The younger and healthier you are, the lower your premium payments will be. But even if you have pre-existing health issues, you can often obtain term coverage at an affordable rate.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.FlexibilityWith term insurance, you can buy a policy based on your specific circumstances. Many people choose a death benefit and policy term according to their financial obligations. For example, you may want to buy enough coverage to pay off your mortgage, replace your income until your children reach adulthood, or cover the costs of your kids\u2019 education. Some people also buy coverage to protect their parents if they co-signed on student loans.Ability to cancel any timeYou can cancel term life insurance at any time without incurring fees if you decide you no longer need coverage.Disadvantages of term life insuranceOf course, term life insurance won\u2019t be the right choice for everyone. Here are some drawbacks to consider before you purchase a policy.No cash valueUnlike permanent life insurance, term life insurance doesn\u2019t build cash value. If you want a policy with a built-in savings or investment component, consider a whole life, universal life or variable life policy.Expires at the end of the termTerm life insurance won\u2019t pay a death benefit if you outlive the term. Your premiums won\u2019t be refunded unless you purchase an add-on called a return of premium rider, which can make your policy as much as five times more expensive.Having coverage that expires isn\u2019t always problematic, though. If you live into your 80s or 90s, it\u2019s less likely that you\u2019ll have people who financially depend on you. However, if you want your survivors to receive a payout no matter when you die, you\u2019ll need permanent coverage.Increased premiums when you renewIf you still need protection after your term expires, you\u2019ll need to renew your policy or purchase a new one. Most term policies offer something called guaranteed renewability, which means you can extend the policy and its death benefit without going through the underwriting process again or having another medical exam.But your premiums will usually be higher. That\u2019s because our lives become more expensive to insure as we age. For the same reason, purchasing new term insurance when your policy expires will typically be more expensive.Term life insurance rates and costsWhen you apply for term life insurance, carriers will assess how risky of an applicant you are. The higher your risk of dying during the specified term, the more you\u2019ll pay. Some important factors that affect term life insurance rates include:Age: Because the risk of death grows higher as you get older, your date of birth is the most important factor insurers consider.Gender: Premiums are typically lower for women than for men because women have longer life expectancies.Health history: Insurers usually review your health records and often require a medical exam during the underwriting process. Some medical conditions will result in higher term life insurance costs or a denial of your application. Carriers will also ask about your family\u2019s history of illness.Tobacco usage: Because smoking carries a higher mortality risk, smokers pay higher premiums. You can often qualify for non-smoker rates after being tobacco-free for one or two years.Hobbies and occupation: People in high-risk occupations, like first responders and construction workers, can expect to pay a higher premium. The same goes for those who engage in risky hobbies, like skydiving or rock climbing.Policy terms: Longer policy terms mean there\u2019s a higher chance a life insurance company will have to pay a death benefit, so you\u2019ll pay more for a 20-year or 30-year term policy than you would for a 10-year term. The higher your death benefit, the higher your premiums will be, as well.Coverage amount and term lengthYour coverage amount and term length will depend on your needs and what you can afford, as well as what you\u2019re approved for during the underwriting process. Someone who is 70 is unlikely to qualify for a 30-year term and would probably have to settle for a 10- or 15-year policy.The DIME formula (debt, income, mortgage, and education) is a common method for determining how much term life insurance you need. Using this formula, you\u2019d add up the following:Debt: Total non-mortgage debtIncome: Your salary times the number of years your family would need to replace that income. Many people use the number of years until their youngest child graduates from high school. So if you earn $60,000 a year and your youngest is 8 years old, they\u2019d be 10 years about graduating, so you\u2019d need about $600,000.Mortgage: Total amount you\u2019d need to pay off your mortgage and any home equity loansEducation: The amount you anticipate paying for each child\u2019s educationBecause your individual needs may be unique, consider working with a life insurance agent to determine the right terms and coverage and get multiple life insurance quotes.Additional options and ridersWhen you buy term life insurance, you\u2019ll often have the option to purchase add-ons known as life insurance riders for an extra cost. Some common life insurance riders include:Accelerated death benefit rider: Allows you to access your death benefit if you\u2019re diagnosed with a qualifying illness (usually, one that\u2019s terminal).Accidental death benefit rider: Increases the policy\u2019s death benefit if you die in an accident.Child or spousal rider: Provides a small death benefit if your child or spouse dies during your policy term, typically to cover final expenses.Term conversion rider: Gives you the option to convert a term policy into a whole life policy at the end of the term.Waiver of premium rider: Allows you to stop paying premiums while keeping the policy in force if you become disabled.Does a term policy meet your life insurance needs?If you have dependents who would struggle financially if you died, life insurance is a must. One of the biggest benefits of term life insurance is that it provides valuable protection for your loved ones at a low cost.Because coverage only lasts for the policy\u2019s term, it\u2019s appropriate when you have specific obligations or temporary needs. For instance, you may want a term policy with a death benefit that could pay off your mortgage and other debts to reduce the financial burden on your spouse or cover your children\u2019s needs in the event you die before they\u2019ve finished their obligations.Term life insurance doesn\u2019t build cash value, so it isn\u2019t a vehicle for saving or investing. But for most people, it provides sufficient financial protection at an affordable price.","Article Anthor":"Robin Hartill, CFP\u00ae","Article Date":"Thu, Sep 7, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"69":{"Article Title":"Custom parts and equipment insurance: what it covers","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/custom-parts-and-equipment-insurance-160731485.html","Article Content":"Standard car insurance typically does not cover aftermarket parts that are added to a vehicle to boost its performance or appeal. Insurers price their coverage based on costs to repair or replace a vehicle as it came from the original manufacturer.If you want to cover such aftermarket modifications\u00a0\u2014 things like amped-up stereos or suspension systems, custom rims, tinted windows, cosmetic paint jobs, and more \u2014 you\u2019ll need to add an optional endorsement to your auto insurance policy called custom parts and equipment (CPE) coverage.This endorsement, or rider, is added to your comprehensive or collision policy and effectively covers your aftermarket \u201cmods\u201d under the same terms. If an incident is covered, then so, too, will the included aftermarket parts. Likewise, the same single car insurance deductible applies.Custom parts and equipment riders can be added to your car insurance policy for as little as several dollars a month on your premiums and typically provide a maximum level of coverage for the aftermarket parts, often a combined total of $5,000.What is custom parts coverage?Custom parts and equipment coverage is optional insurance that covers aftermarket modifications made to enhance your vehicle\u2019s looks or performance. It is not for aftermarket parts \u2014 a term used for non-manufacturer parts \u2014 that your mechanic finds and installs to keep the car running.CPE coverage is added to your comprehensive and\/or collision policies and comes with a maximum payout amount per event or car accident, usually between $2,000 and $10,000. The typical coverage limit is $5,000.What modifications need extra insurance?Any part that you install on the car that did not come from the factory as part of the original model is considered a modification and could require custom parts and equipment coverage. Common examples include:Custom wheels and rimsOversized and custom tiresSpeakers, TVs, DVD players and other electronic equipmentLeather seat coversRoll barsTrailer hitchesBed linersRunning boardsTintingCustom paint jobsStrut barsSpoilersNavigation systemsUndercarriage lighting, fog lights and other custom lightsDoes regular insurance cover aftermarket parts?In a few states, aftermarket parts are automatically covered up to $1,000 in comprehensive and collision policies. In addition, some insurers may include certain types of modifications in your comprehensive or collision coverage, particularly if those modifications are considered safety components. An example might be an anti-theft device or rear-view camera. In fact, some of these can potentially lead to auto insurance discounts.In general, though, you\u2019ll want to assume that the insurer is not going to cover any modifications or enhancements you make to your car. Review the policy\u2019s fine print or call your insurance company to ask. It\u2019s important to note that \u201cfull coverage\u201d does not mean aftermarket parts are included. Having \u201cfull coverage\u201d simply means having all three categories of insurance: comprehensive, collision, and liability. And when the insurer is pricing those standard auto insurance policies, it is assuming you drive a model that includes only factory parts.Does insurance cover rim damage?Original rims that came with the car, or that were installed to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, are covered just like other parts of the car under your comprehensive and collision insurance. If the rims are damaged in a covered event \u2014 say you hit rocks or a pothole \u2014 standard rims will be covered, though repairs in many cases may not exceed your deductible amount.However, if you have added aftermarket rims, then you will need to add a custom parts and equipment endorsement to your policy to cover them.The tire and wheel insurance marketed by car dealers often covers 100% of the cost of repairs or replacement of damaged rims and tires on the car at the time of sale. Many insurers offer similar plans at a much-reduced cost.Informing your insurance company about modificationsIn most cases, aftermarket parts do not void\u00a0your regular insurance coverage. But if you use aftermarket parts that the insurer thinks could compromise safety, the company could conceivably void your policy and refuse to make any payouts at all. Examples include changes to the suspension system that affect the way the car handles; spoilers or scoops that make the car faster; or engine modifications that boost its speed.That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to inform your auto insurer of any changes you make to the vehicle. In addition, if you want the insurer to cover an added part, it\u2019s a good bet the insurer will need to know about the part before you file a claim.","Article Anthor":"Karen Aho","Article Date":"Fri, Sep 8, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"70":{"Article Title":"How many checking accounts should I have?","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-many-checking-accounts-should-i-have-191519405.html","Article Content":"Where you keep your money is just as important as what you spend it on. The right mix of financial accounts can help you stay organized and hit your financial goals a lot faster.One of the most basic types of accounts is a traditional checking account. For some, one checking account is enough to get the job done, while others might benefit from having more than one checking account. Here\u2019s what you need to know to decide if one or multiple checking accounts is right for your financial situation.Checking accounts, explainedA checking account is a type of deposit account offered by banks and credit unions in which you can add money or make payments to cover bills and living expenses using a debit card, online bill pay, or personal check. Unlike a savings account or money market account, checking accounts are meant to be more transactional, with frequent deposits and withdrawals.Checking accounts are one of the most common banking products held by a majority of American consumers. According to the 2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, 95.5% of US households \u2014 about 126.6 million Americans \u2014 were \"banked\" in 2021, meaning that at least one member of the household had a checking or high-yield savings account at a bank or credit union.When it makes sense to have multiple checking accountsInstances where having more than one checking account could come in handy might include:If you\u2019re merging your financesHaving more than one checking account could make it easier to divide your monthly bills and keep your personal spending separate from shared expenses with your partner, roommate, or family members.Say you share the cost of groceries or household products; having a joint checking account could make it easier to keep track of how much you\u2019re spending on household bills and ensure that those expenses aren\u2019t eating away at your personal budget.If your checking account balance exceeds FDIC or NCUA coverageMost deposit accounts are federally insured if your bank or credit union is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Association (NCUA). Typically, the limit is $250,000 per depositor, per account. The upside here is that if your financial institution fails, your money is protected. However, if you keep more than the maximum amount of money covered in your bank account, you could run the risk of losing some of those funds should your banking institution fail.In these cases, it could make sense to open a separate account and keep some of your funds in that account so that you\u2019re always covered. If you are putting away a large sum of money, the best place for it would likely be an interest-bearing account. While there are checking accounts that earn interest, these interest rates are typically lower than APYs on high-yield savings accounts, CDs, or money market accounts.If your bank is offering a lucrative promotion or sign-up bonusTo attract new customers, banks or credit unions may incentivize you to open a new account by rewarding you with a sign-up bonus. The terms usually require that you set up direct deposit and fund your account within a certain period of time in order to take advantage of this kind of promotion.You shouldn\u2019t open a new checking account simply to take advantage of a sign-up bonus, but if your goal is to organize your finances and create separate accounts for different spending needs, a sign-up bonus might be the right reason to do so.If you primarily bank online and need ATM or branch accessOnline banks, or neobanks, have risen in popularity as a low-cost way to bank. Because these institutions don\u2019t have brick-and-mortar branches, these banks can save on overhead costs and pass those savings down to customers in the form of lower fees and higher APYs.The downside: If you bank with an online-only bank, you may not have the same access to ATMs or a bank representative that you do with a traditional bank.In these cases, opening up a checking account at a different bank with a physical location near you could make it easier to transfer funds and withdraw cash without incurring steep bank fees.If you\u2019re starting a businessMany financial institutions offer financial products that cater to business owners like business checking accounts, credit cards, small business loans, and more. Keeping your personal transactions separate from your business transactions can help you keep better track of your income and outflow.It can also help you understand how your business is doing from a profitability standpoint and simplify your recordkeeping in the event of a tax audit.How to determine the right number of checking accounts for youThere is no \u201cright\u201d number of checking accounts, but there are factors you can consider to determine the right number of accounts for your financial situation.What are your financial goals?Outlining your short and long-term goals can help you narrow down which kinds of financial products make the most sense for you. The answer may not be multiple checking accounts. It could involve a mix of account types, perhaps a checking account for your everyday spending and a certificate of deposit for a longer-term savings goal like putting money away for a down payment for your first home.If your aim is to grow your emergency fund, opting for a savings vehicle that is less accessible could make more sense so that you aren\u2019t tempted to dip into your account for short-term expenses.What does your everyday spending look like?If you are moving in with your partner and have shared expenses as well as personal expenses \u2014 such as a monthly student loan payment \u2014 having more than one checking account will ensure that those funds don\u2019t get mixed up.If you\u2019re still hesitant about the idea of opening another checking account, there are tools you can use to accomplish the same goal that multiple checking accounts would. Mint, Rocket Money, Honeydue, and EveryDollar are budgeting apps you can use to split bills with a partner, keep track of your monthly bills, or both.Would multiple checking accounts simplify your personal finances?Having more than one checking account can make it easier to categorize your income into buckets and allocate a certain amount; however, it can also make it more difficult to track how your income is being spent.Certain checking accounts may also have minimum balance requirements that you\u2019ll need to adhere to to avoid any added fees or penalties. If you prefer to keep things simple, you can opt for just one checking account for your regular spending and one savings account where you can save money for bigger expenses and goals.","Article Anthor":"Ivana Pino","Article Date":"Wed, Sep 6, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"},"71":{"Article Title":"How to open a CD","Article Link":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/personal-finance\/how-to-open-a-cd-165257375.html","Article Content":"concept of financial wealth, investment success. happy people character make money. Cartoon millionaire or banker holding big coin. Financial growth, flat vector illustration on a white background.If you have a sum of money that you want to save securely, a certificate of deposit, usually called a CD, is a good option. However, unlike a traditional savings account, once you open and fund a CD, your money has to remain tucked away for a fixed period of time.Read on to understand if a CD is the right kind of savings vehicle for you, and how to open one if it is.How a CD worksA CD stores and grows your money for a fixed period, known as its term, usually ranging anywhere from a month to five years, though longer-term CDs are available. A CD can be ideal if you want to save for a long-term goal, such as purchasing a home.What sets a CD apart from other deposit accounts, like a high-yield savings account, is that CDs have a fixed rate. This means that your APY isn\u2019t sensitive to interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve after you\u2019ve already opened your account.However, if you think you may need access to your money for unexpected costs, a CD probably isn\u2019t the best choice. If you withdraw money from a CD before its term ends, also known as its maturity date, you\u2019ll likely pay an early withdrawal penalty, reducing \u2014 or even eliminating \u2014 any interest you may have earned. In some cases, you could even lose some of your initial deposit.Also, if you\u2019re the kind of saver who wants to make additional deposits and continue to build on your balance, you might consider a different type of savings product like a traditional savings or money market account. Most CDs don\u2019t allow you to continue making deposits after your first deposit.Once your CD has reached the end of the term, you can withdraw your principal balance, plus any earned interest. In some cases, you might opt to rollover your CD into a new account and continue to grow your savings that way.Go deeper: How to choose the right CD.Decide what kind of CD to openThere are several different types of CDs, and it\u2019s important to choose the one most suited to your savings goal.Here are the most common types:Traditional CD: The most common type of CD; your initial deposit must remain untouched for a fixed term. If you withdraw your money early, you\u2019ll pay a penalty.Jumbo CD: A traditional CD but with a higher minimum opening deposit, usually at least $100,000. It will pay a higher annual percentage yield, or APY.No-penalty CD: A CD without an early withdrawal penalty but with a lower APY.Add-on CD: You can add more money to this CD even after opening the account.Bump-up CD: You can choose to increase the APY a limited number of times during the CD term to keep up with rising interest rates.Not every financial institution will offer all CD types. When you\u2019re shopping for a CD, read the fine print on the deposit agreement to ensure you know what you\u2019re signing up for.Go deeper: How to save with CDs.Choose a term length and shop for the best CD rateCDs with longer terms usually offer higher annual percentage yields \u2014 up to a point. CD APYs tend to reflect market expectations for interest rates. So if rates are expected to rise in the short term but fall in a couple of years, CDs with terms up to two years may offer higher rates than those with a three-year term.Be sure to compare APYs and terms carefully so you get the best rate for the term that suits your financial goals. For example, if you want to buy a house in a year and are keeping your down payment in a CD, choose one with a 12-month term or less.A CD\u2019s APY is a calculation of the total return you\u2019ll earn, including compound interest. Compound interest is the interest you earn on previously accrued interest. Like savings accounts, CD APYs will differ depending from bank to bank. Online banks often offer better APYs than traditional banks. And don\u2019t overlook credit unions, which call CDs share certificates, and sometimes offer higher APYs.Go deeper: What is APY?Where to open a CD accountOnce you choose a bank, credit union or neobank, you can complete an application online or in person. If you\u2019re opening a new CD online, you'll have to create an account with the bank or credit union if you don't have one already.To open a CD, you'll usually have to provide the following information:Full legal nameSocial Security number or taxpayer identification numberBirth dateCurrent addressYou must be 18 or older to open a CD. If you are younger than 18, a parent or legal guardian can open a custodial CD for you.Fund your CDOnce you select the CD and term, you\u2019ll transfer funds to the financial institution or write a check to fund the account.FAQsHow much can I deposit in a CD?Many online banks and credit unions do not have minimum deposit requirements, but some major banks have a minimum opening deposit requirement starting at $1,000. If you don\u2019t have that much money, look for a bank with a low or no minimum deposit. The maximum you can deposit also varies depending on the bank or credit union.If your financial institution is a member of the FDIC or the NCUA, your CDs are insured for up to $250,000. If you have more than that to put aside, you may want to speak to a professional financial adviser about how to proceed.Does it cost money to open a CD?Opening a CD does not come with a separate fee.Can I undo opening a CD?Before you fund your CD, check your bank or credit union\u2019s policies to see if it offers a grace period at the time of opening. These are not common, so it\u2019s best to be sure before you open your account.How many CDs can I open?There is no limit to how many CDs you can open in general, but some banks may have a maximum number of CDs you can open with them. If you plan to use a CD ladder as part of your savings strategy, you should ask your financial institution what that limit is.Click the image to compare CDs","Article Anthor":"Zina Kumok","Article Date":"Wed, Sep 6, 2023","Article Source":"YahooFinance"}}
