Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way: There is literally no such thing as overpaying for a property. As soon as escrow closes, that property becomes a new\u00a0comp, and, by definition, it\u2019s worth\u00a0exactly\u00a0what the buyer paid for it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way: There is literally no such thing as overpaying for a property.

Boiling it down even further: There are many reasons people buy investment property, but it boils down to three main drivers: cash flow, equity, and tax benefits. Each benefit has a different psychology behind it, but what many people don\u2019t realize is that as you progress through your investing career, your resources, comprehension, and goals will change. They\u00a0should\u00a0change. It\u2019s absolutely a good thing.\u00a0 Boiling it down even further: There are many reasons people buy investment property, but it boils down to three main drivers: cash flow, equity, and tax benefits.

For example, if you bought a B duplex in a decent neighborhood for $300,000 and figured it would be worth $400,000 in five years, broken down by month, that would give you monthly equity growth of $1,666. That\u2019s significantly more attractive than $200 per month, especially when the property and tenants are much easier to manage, and rents go up by around 5% per year.\u00a0 Think of it this way: If you didn\u2019t need that $200 per month in cash flow, would you still buy it rather than a property that you thought would be worth 30% more in five years?

Purchasing investment properties requires different factors, decisions, and calculations that regular real estate agents don\u2019t use. A real estate license isn\u2019t enough to qualify agents to help you with real estate investment purchases. So before you hire an agent to work with you in your real estate investment business, you should know what to ask the agent before starting out. 1. Are You a Full-Time Agent? Real estate investors need full-time agents with a 100% focus on real estate. While many agents work part-time and do well at it, real estate investors need top-performing agents who are 100% dedicated to real estate. They should constantly have their ears on the ground to find the best properties for your real estate portfolio. The home buying process is intense, and if you work with an agent who doesn\u2019t work full-time, you may not get the attention to detail you need. An agent who is distracted by other jobs or responsibilities may miss the crucial moment a property becomes available, thereby handing it over to the competition because they weren\u2019t on the job at the time. 2. How Much Experience Do You Have? Many buyers don\u2019t ask about an agent\u2019s experience level because they feel like they are prying, but working with experienced agents is the key to reaching your real estate goals. Suppose you have the choice between a prospective agent who has only sold one investment property versus another prospective Realtor with years of experience buying and selling investment properties. In that case, you\u2019ll likely go with the agent with more recently sold homes. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask intimate questions about an agent\u2019s experience.       3. How Many Clients Are You Working With? Knowing how many buyers and sellers a real estate agent accepts at once is important. Compare the number of clients the agent takes on at a time to the level of service you expect. A great agent can handle many clients simultaneously, but you must compare it to what you expect when house hunting or selling properties. If an agent has too many clients, it can affect the level of service you receive. 4. Are Your Clients Mostly Buyers or Sellers? Real estate investors buy and sell properties. Depending on what you need to do, you\u2019ll need different types of agents.\u00a0 A buyer\u2019s agent represents you when buying a home. They are the agents with their ears to the ground, waiting for the perfect property to hit the market.\u00a0 These agents negotiate the deal for you and help you seal the deal. They are your eyes and ears out in the market. A seller\u2019s agent works for the seller, marketing the property based on the listing agreement. A home sells when a real estate agent sets the right selling price and markets the property appropriately. Since you\u2019re investing in real estate to make a profit, you want an agent who will get as much money as possible for the home and market it so that it sells fast. 5. Do You Invest Yourself? Working with real estate agents who invest in real estate themselves brings a whole new level to the support they can provide. Like anything in life, you learn more by doing, so working with someone who understands the ins and outs of owning investment real estate is a game changer. They\u2019ll understand the buying and selling process and can help make investing in real estate easier for you. Of course, you don\u2019t want to hire an agent with the same real estate investing strategy as you, as that would create a conflict of interest. Working with a real estate professional who understands the factors most important to you when investing in real estate is an important consideration. 6. What Sets You Apart From Other Agents? We all know the real estate market is competitive, and there are many real estate agents out there, so asking an agent what sets them apart from the rest can help you decide which one is the best fit for you and your needs. If an agent can\u2019t come up with something that sets them apart from the others, what benefits do you have by choosing that agent? Look for agents who take pride in their work and specialize in the areas you need, such as fix-and-flips or finding rental properties, so you get matched with the right person for you. 7. Do You Have a Team? If So, What Role Do You Play in the Process? Working with a real estate team may be a good idea, but if you choose an agent who doles out all the responsibilities to the team and never has any hands-on experience with you, it might not be what you want. Ask an agent specifically which tasks they delegate and which they handle themselves. For example, will the agent call you about new properties themselves, or will they give that task to an administrative assistant? Also, ask who will answer your questions and concerns when they arise. This doesn\u2019t mean team members aren\u2019t up to the task, but when you hire an agent, that\u2019s who you want to work with on the most important details of the process. 8. How Well Do You Know the Local Market? If you\u2019re investing in an area you aren\u2019t familiar with, you need an agent who is familiar with the area. This is especially important if you\u2019re buying a rental property. You must know about the quality of the schools, the proximity to highways and public transportation, and the accessibility of amenities like grocery stores, churches, and other basic needs. 9. What Is Your Purchase Price to List Price Ratio? The purchase price to list price ratio compares the final sales price to the last listing price and tells you how often the agent can help their sellers get the highest selling price for their home. This may not reflect the original listing price if the price changes, but it will give you a good idea. Numbers below 100% mean the agent often sells the house for less than the asking price, and any number above 100% means the agent sells the house for more than the asking price. If you\u2019re selling homes, you want an agent with a high sale-to-list-price ratio, and vice versa if you\u2019re buying homes. 10. What Fees Must I Pay? If you\u2019re buying investment properties, you shouldn\u2019t be on the hook for any fees regarding the real estate professional. However, if you\u2019re selling properties, you\u2019re responsible for the agent\u2019s commission, plus any other fees. Both buyers and sellers are responsible for fees such as: \nAppraisals\nAttorney fees\nClosing costs\nCredit reports\nTitle insurance\n Ask the agent what fees are included in the real estate transaction and which you\u2019d be responsible for if you chose them as your agent. Also ask the agent if their commission fees are negotiable, especially if they are higher than other agents\u2019 fees. 11. How Many Clients Have You Helped Purchase Investment Properties? A real estate agent can say they specialize in real estate investment properties, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have experience in it. Ask real estate professionals how many investment properties they\u2019ve successfully closed within the last 12 months. Having experience as a buyer\u2019s agent for one investment property doesn\u2019t make the agent an expert in the real estate industry. You can also take it a step further and ask a Realtor how they get in touch with a listing agent. Does the agent already have a large network of agents they work with, or do they cold-call agents and work their magic to win their clients the property? 12. Can You Provide References From Past Clients? Nothing tells you more about an agent\u2019s abilities than the words of past clients. Consider it a red flag if you ask a real estate agent for referrals and they don\u2019t offer them. A good agent should happily hand over referrals to get more business\u2014unless they didn\u2019t do a good job and are worried about what previous clients will say to you. Of course, you can also read online reviews from satisfied clients (or unsatisfied clients), but hearing from people who have worked with this particular person can give you a better feel for what an agent offers. 13. Do You Find Properties Other Than Those Listed in the Multiple Listing Service? A big part of success in real estate investing is finding properties at the right time. Waiting until properties hit the MLS can be too late, especially if you invest in fix-and-flip properties or look for short sales. Finding an agent with resources outside the MLS can make all the difference in your transactions because it is such a competitive market. If you find an agent who finds properties outside the MLS, ask what strategies they use and what types of homes they find. For example, do they locate abandoned properties for fix-and-flips or target people about to enter foreclosure, helping their buyers purchase short-sale properties? 14. What Is Your Marketing Plan? Working with a full-time agent isn\u2019t enough; you need to find an agent with a solid marketing strategy. Ask agents about how they market homes they sell and how they find homes for and target buyers. Ensure the strategy fits your investment needs and will help you find the right properties. For example, it wouldn\u2019t be a good fit if you\u2019re selling a small starter townhouse and the agent specializes in luxury homes. 15. Can You Help Me Find Other Professionals? Real estate investors need to work with other professionals, such as: \nAppraisers\nGeneral contractors\nLawyers\nLenders\nMoving companies\n Ask about an agent\u2019s network to ensure they have the professionals on board to help you succeed in real estate transactions. 16. How Often Will I Hear From You? Time is of the essence in real estate. When looking for real estate agents, have a definition of what a timely manner is in your mind, and see how it compares to what potential real estate agents offer. For example, if an agent provides updates every few days but you prefer daily updates, you should change real estate agents to one who communicates more regularly. 17. Why Are You a Good Fit for Me? Of course, the most important question you can ask any real estate agent is why they are a good fit for you. Let them sell you the reasons they should be the person you pick for the important job of finding real estate properties. If an agent can\u2019t answer the question, that means they didn\u2019t get to know you well enough or don\u2019t take enough pride in their work. You want someone who will proudly say why they stand apart from most agents and how they can help you with your home sale or purchase to achieve your real estate goals. How to Find an Investor-Friendly Agent Now that you know what to ask a real estate agent, the next question is, how do you find qualified agents? A few ways are to join real estate investing groups, talk to property management companies, and network online. The more people you talk to, the easier it is to find the perfect professional for you. Another great way to find an agent is through referrals. Working with someone who you know does a great job based on someone else\u2019s input can provide peace of mind, knowing you\u2019re working with a good professional.

Nearly sixty percent of homes for sale are unaffordable to the average American. What\u2019s causing such a lack of affordability? High mortgage rates, meager supply, and baby boomers refusing to sell their single-family homes (seriously). These factors have created a housing market where \u201cforced renter households\u201d will become the norm\u2026but not for long. According to Matthew Gardner, Chief Economist at Windermere Real Estate, there\u2019s at least some hope on the horizon. Mathew knows the solution to this almost unfathomable unaffordability issue, and it\u2019s much simpler than most people think. In this episode, he talks about the primary driver of high home prices, the factors causing so many Americans to rent, and why we can\u2019t repair this market using the same housing market \u201cincentives\u201d that worked in the past. And, as someone who works regularly with large-scale investors, Mathew has some advice for those still trying to invest in a market where profits seem improbable. When will mortgage rates head down? How long will unaffordability last? And what\u2019s the solution Matthew thinks will solve it all? We\u2019ll get into all that in this episode! Click here to listen on Apple Podcasts.

James, is that a\u2026 Do you have a tower of Rockstar Energy Drink behind you? James:\nI do, it\u2019s my\u2026 My staff got me a Rockstar cake for my 40th birthday. So, it had this beautiful bouquet on top, and so it\u2019s been slow. It\u2019s kind of like the cake in your kitchen though. I could feel like I\u2019m pulling the frosting off because I\u2019m pulling one can out at a time. I was trying to keep it, but I can\u2019t help it. Dave:\nJames, you\u2019re an easy man to buy a gift for, if all you need is Rockstar Energy Drink. For those who don\u2019t know James personally, he is never more than a few inches away from Rockstar, so that seems like a very good gift for him. James:\nA sales fuel. Sales fuel. Dave:\nAbsolutely. Well, you recommended the excellent guest we have today. Tell us first of all, who our guest is and why you wanted to bring him on? James:\nYeah, so Matthew Gardner is the chief economist of the Windermere, which is a real estate company mostly in the Pacific Northwest or the West Coast. But in our local market, they are the biggest brokerage. They have the best brand presence. And for years, I\u2019ve been listening to Matthew talk about the economy, whether it was in the recession times or even up in today, and he\u2019s just very factual. He understands stats, he looks at trends, and he\u2019s just a very smart guy. And he\u2019s so well-spoken with how he delivers the information. But everybody in the Pacific Northwest loves Matthew. We all listen to his reports. He always provides value. Dave:\nYeah, absolutely. I didn\u2019t know who Matthew was until we booked him for the show, and I\u2019ve been reading some of his reports here. And I\u2019m super excited to talk to him about affordability, because this is\u2026 We talk about rates, which obviously is a lot on the show, that has a huge impact on affordability. But there are a lot of variables that go into affordability. And I think there\u2019s a little bit of misunderstanding and confusion around the topic, so I\u2019m really looking forward to digging into the affordability question with him. Is there anything else you\u2019re hoping to talk to him about? James:\nWell, I am hoping he gives me a little gold nugget for the Pacific Northwest of what to go buy, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to be able to give me that. Dave:\nLike, you want a specific address, like he\u2019s going to tell you exactly what to go buy. James:\nYeah, \u201cBuy here, it will grow.\u201d Dave:\nIf he knows that, he might keep that for some paying clients. I don\u2019t know if he just dishes that out to an entire podcast audience. James:\nThat\u2019s true. Well, maybe we\u2019ll be buddy buddies by the end of the podcast, and he\u2019ll give me those little golden gems. Dave:\nWell, I think no matter what, it might not be down to the address level, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to get some golden gems out of Matthew. And for all of you listening, if you do appreciate us bringing on these types of economists who help you unpack and understand the market that we\u2019re in right now, I help identify opportunities for your own investment portfolio. Please make sure to write On The Market a review. You can do that either on Spotify or on Apple.\nAnd I know it\u2019s just like this little thing, and I promise it only takes like 30 seconds, but it really does help the show a lot be able to attract these types of guests, and continuing to make this great content. So, if you\u2019re a loyal listener and you haven\u2019t yet written us a review, we would really appreciate if you took one minute to do that on Spotify or Apple right now. With that said, let\u2019s bring on Matthew Gardner, the chief economist for Windermere Real Estate. Matthew Gardner, welcome to On The Market. Thanks for being here. Matthew:\nHello, Dave. Good to be here. Thanks for the invitation. Dave:\nAbsolutely. We\u2019re excited to have you. Let\u2019s start by having you introduce yourself and tell our audience a little bit about what you do as it relates to real estate and real estate investing. Matthew:\nAs far as a background, as you can probably gather, I\u2019m not from around here. I was born, raised and educated in the United Kingdom. After completing my formal education at Oxford and London School of Economics, I joined an old company of land agents. And these are companies that managed institutional portfolios of real estate. And the company I worked for represented not just my college, but the royal family as well. And there, I was involved as an analyst in advising on their portfolio, where they should sell, where they should buy.\nI came to the Pacific Northwest, I\u2019m based now in Seattle, in the late \u201990s to visit my sister actually who was already living here. And what I found very quickly is that real estate developers, well, they really ride on themselves in deciding what to build. No one\u2019s really advising them. So, I saw a niche, opened up my own company, spent 18 years advising developers, governments, and other entities on what was going on in the development world. And Windermere Real Estate was a very early client of mine. That relationship continued through my entire time having my company. So, eight years ago when they talked me into joining them\u2026 And Windermere is a company, if you don\u2019t know this, we have about 300 offices in the 10 Western States. About 6,500 brokers that sold roughly $45 billion worth of real estate last year. And as chief economist, my ultimate goal is to analyze and interpret economic information, so I can advise our brokers on what\u2019s going on, so they can therefore best advise their clients. Dave:\nAll right, Matthew. Well, I could see why James wanted to have you on. You\u2019re obviously an expert in his favorite market of Seattle, and obviously are doing the type of work that all of our audience is very eager to hear about. So, I\u2019ve read a few of your reports, but let\u2019s start\u2026 I want to dig into affordability today, but let\u2019s just start by having you share some of your just high-level thoughts about the housing market today, to get us rolling. Matthew:\nWell, I think the big thing that everyone, it\u2019s like the 800-pound gorilla for want of a better word, is inventory. There is none. And of course there\u2019s nothing on the market to buy, then brokers can\u2019t sell anything. And that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re going to see a remarkably low level of transactions this year. Now, is it going to get better? Well, that\u2019s perhaps something we\u2019ll talk about momentarily. But I think there are a couple of things are, one is supply, lack of it.\nAnd on the other side of the equation, is a lot of people saying, \u201cOkay, well, look at where interest rates, where mortgage rates are today. We\u2019re at what? 7.2% I think, this morning. Isn\u2019t that going to cause the market to, in essence, collapse in the same way it did in 2007?\u201d And I would argue that is certainly not the case, but it is a big concern. It\u2019s a big concern certainly as it relates to affordability. But right now, we are in a housing market that quite frankly just lacks direction. It doesn\u2019t know where it wants to be and where it\u2019s going to go, certainly over the course of the next year or so. James:\nWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last six months is you keep hearing the doom and gloom about rate increasing. We\u2019ve seen them dramatically go up over the last nine months. And I think everybody\u2019s been waiting for that shoe to drop, but yet that we still see the median home price creeping up nationwide, which is, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing for Jerome Powell, and whether he\u2019s just going to keep increasing rates because it\u2019s not going in the direction he wants.\nBut what is your take on that, because I think that\u2019s caught everybody off guard. I did not think that the median home price would be climbing. And it\u2019s not going up rapidly, but it\u2019s had steady increases as rates keep going up. Is that a concern that you think rates will continue to go? Or is it more that you just think that the inventory\u2019s so low, it doesn\u2019t even matter, and people are finding a way to buy? Matthew:\nI think it\u2019s probably more the latter rather than the former in that respect, James. Do I think rates are going to continue to rise? I think it is unlikely. And I think quite frankly that we\u2019ve peaked out pretty much where we are today. I\u2019ll be massively surprised, I think everyone else would, to see rates continue to get up into the eights, and even potentially north of that. So, I think we\u2019ve peaked.\nBut as far as its impact on housing, I think you\u2019re absolutely right. A lot of people thought it will, borrowing costs, if they\u2019ve doubled. And as we all know, right? It\u2019s a very simple piece of math. If you want to keep the same payment, well, for every one percentage point increase in mortgage rates, you can afford to borrow 10% less, and keep that payment the same.\nSo, whatever you\u2019re paying, let\u2019s say at four, if rates went to five, and you wanted to keep that payment the same as you had before, then you could borrow 10% less. So, everyone thought, \u201cYeah, the market\u2019s going to cause the market to collapse, some massive erosion in home prices.\u201d But it is that supply side part of the equation that really is supporting values. And it goes back to Econ 101, right? And if you have limited supply, but still net-new demand, that allows prices to appreciate.\nBut I think a lot of people are also hedging. They\u2019re saying, \u201cOkay, you know what? I found the perfect house. It\u2019s one I\u2019ve been wanting to buy forever. It\u2019s now on the market. I know I hate mortgage rates where they are, but I\u2019ll buy now, and I will refinance down the road.\u201d So, the expectation is that rates will come down, and that is really what is supporting home values, at least nationally. Of course, not all markets are created equal. Dave:\nSo, Matthew, we\u2019re sort of talking a little bit around here about affordability, and obviously there are multiple inputs into affordability, so I want to dig into that. But can you just tell our audience a little bit about what affordability means in terms of the housing market, and what are the different variables that make up affordability? Matthew:\nOnly from affordability index, and as you know, a lot of entities are out there that put their own numbers out. And what it really looks at is the ability for a household who\u2019s making an area\u2019s median income, \u201cCan they afford a median priced house based upon the last quarter, last year\u2019s sale price?\u201d Normally, it\u2019s quarterly. So, that really is the math that goes into it. So you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re making, you know what they can borrow, make some assumptions on down payments, taxes, et cetera. But can they afford to buy some or not?\nAnd I think if you look at affordability in general, and quite frankly, it\u2019s something which has been keeping me awake at night for the last 20 odd years. It\u2019s always been an issue because there is a massive undersupply of housing. And so, is housing affordable across the country? It\u2019s not, but I think we\u2019ll probably get to that point in a minute. But in essence, it really looks at relationship between home prices in a location, and how much households are making. Dave:\nThank you for explaining that. And could you tell us a little bit about where affordability is now, in a historical context? Matthew:\nOkay. Well, there\u2019s two groups I look at in terms of the numbers that they put out relative to affordability. One, obviously is the National Association of Realtors. And their affordability index really suggested that a household in America making median income could not afford to buy a medium-priced house starting in May of last year. As we all know, that was when actually a month or so after mortgage rates started to jump massively. Now, although it does say they were technically affordable in two months later on that year, August and December. For the last five months of this year, most recent dates within July, US housing is not technically affordable. That\u2019s across the country.\nNow, there\u2019s another index put out by the National Association of Home Builders. Now, their data, the second quarter of the year, suggests that, 40.5% of homes, both new and resale single-family homes that sold in the second quarter, were affordable. So, that\u2019s less than half. Now, that number\u2019s up from about 38% I believe, in the fourth quarter of last year. But it was the third-lowest level of affordability we\u2019ve seen since they started publishing that report back in what? 2004. So, affordability, certainly in a lot of the country, not everywhere is a major constraint still. And I think that\u2019s likely to continue to be the case. Dave:\nI think affordability comes up a lot, because people look at some of these indices, and they see what you\u2019re showing, that indexes that measure this are at some of the lowest points that they\u2019ve been in multiple decades. And they say, \u201c[inaudible 00:12:23], the housing market has to correct.\u201d This is sort of the thing, like, \u201cLook, this is unsustainable.\u201d Do you believe that? Do you believe that we do need to get back to, let\u2019s say the average affordability of the last 40 years? Or are we sort of in this new normal now, where housing affordability is just lower? Matthew:\nI think about it in terms of the ability not just for household to buy a home, but look at homeownership rates. If going back from 1965 to now on average, 65% of US households own their home, 35% rent, just that is what it is. Sorry, jump up significantly as the housing bubble was forming. And that really kind of started actually in the early 1990s. But anyway, but it really has trended back to that level. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a case that we need to see prices drop, because of course, incomes have not, they continue to go up, that can allow prices to increase. And there\u2019s only really been a couple of times since 1890, I think, we\u2019ve seen a systemic decline in home values.\nSo, I think that that\u2019s unlikely, but the way to address it is really rather simple, more supply. And so that supply can come from two areas. It can come from either the resale market, more people selling? Unlikely. And it can come potentially from investors. Say, \u201cOkay, well, now\u2019s the time for me to cash out. I\u2019ve done very well in having single-family rentals or housing which I\u2019ve owned as an investment.\u201d So, Dave, it can happen that way, but quite frankly, I think it needs to come from the new construction market. We just need to build a lot more. And that in turn, more supply, still a reasonable amount of demand that can allow price growth to slow down pretty significantly, which I think is what\u2019s needed. James:\nThat\u2019s an interesting conversation, because for investors like myself that are buying and producing housing, it also is hard to find inventory right now that you can actually mathematically make sense. We have construction costs are still\u2026 they\u2019re down 10% roughly year-over-year it seems like, but the costs are still outrageous. Getting people to show up is a struggle still. And for investors, you still have to buy product at a certain price, whether it\u2019s land or value-add property. And so when we\u2019re looking at these, we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, okay, we have to put a certain amount of money in, so we still have to sell them for a very high price.\u201d Which is kind of going against the affordability, right? For a lot of us investors, we have to sell it at peak because we\u2019re giving it kind of peak type of product, totally turned.\nAnd as the affordability starts to shrink, do you get concerned that people can\u2019t keep up? Wage growth, they\u2019re predicting that is going to be three to 4% for this year. And that the cost of housing is going up. And I know locally in our Seattle market, I look at what things are selling for and who the buyers are, I\u2019m like, \u201cWow, they are really stretching themselves.\u201d So, if this continues to increase, how are they going to keep up with it with wage growth kind of getting flat, or forecasting being more flat for the next 12 months? Matthew:\nBut, again, you have to look back in time, which is what us economists always do. We try and figure out the future by looking behind us, what happened in the past? Historically across the country, again, going back over a hundred years, house value is got by inflation, just the way it\u2019s always worked. In a couple of periods where that hasn\u2019t quite worked out well, and recently obviously because of where inflation was, that reaction was different. But that is where we\u2019ve seen it. So, ultimately, do I expect to see home values or the pace of growth slow? Yeah.\nBut when you think about pricing, what\u2019s fascinating is the variability. We all talk about every market\u2019s local, right? So, if you think about the coastal markets, do they go up by more than the Midwest of the United States? Of course they do. 15 of the least affordable housing markets in America are where? California. And so it\u2019s quite remarkable. So, where you have a situation, that\u2019s where we are seeing some jurisdictions, some states try and look at, \u201cOkay, well, coastal markets or coastal states are expensive, why?\u201d Lack of land, and also land regulation. Trying to loosen those regulatory constraints, free up more land in order to build more, because their view is, and I agree, that we have to build our way out of this issue.\nBecause we\u2019re not likely to see sales increase or get back up to that six, six and a half million level. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see that. If you think about it this way, mortgage rates back in 1980 were what? Almost 20%. But by a decade, it came down from 20% to 12%, to 6%, et cetera. So, as rates come down, people\u2019s buying power increased, and that was therefore their incentive to say, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s time for me to sell, upsize, and move on.\u201d\nBut that would require rates not just dropping back to in the fives, which I think is where they\u2019re going to end up long-term, but continue to drop. And we\u2019re not going to see that, otherwise money will be free, right? So, I think we really have reached that point whereby I don\u2019t expect to see transactions increase beyond the normal demographic scenarios of people downsizing. We know that baby boomers are getting older, but quite frankly, they\u2019re not downsizing at the speed we\u2019d like to see for a couple of reasons. One of which is, they\u2019ve got too much stuff, and the kids, you try and give it to them, it\u2019ll be on eBay next week. So, they\u2019re not downsizing. And so if they\u2019re not downsizing, the move-up buyers, they have limited opportunity. If they\u2019re not moving, then the first-time buyers are shot. And that is the market we really need to start addressing. Dave:\nWell, just as an anecdotal evidence, there\u2019s a, I won\u2019t name, a group in my family. Some boomers who sold their house to, quote, unquote, \u201cdownsize.\u201d And they wound up buying a five-bedroom house that was bigger than their earlier one. So, I think just in my personal experience, I\u2019ve seen that myself. Matthew:\nAnd they do that because they think that all the kids are going to come back and visit with them. No, they\u2019re not. Dave:\nHonestly, that is the number one thing. They want everyone in one house at the same time. Which I understand, but that\u2019s like a use case of maybe one time per year, or every other year. Matthew:\nExactly. Dave:\nAnd now they\u2019re taking up all this housing. That\u2019s a whole other sociological discussion. But I just want to sort of recap what you were saying before, about rates and going down. You were saying that, \u201cYou didn\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get to that transaction volume of six million again.\u201d I just want to make sure I understand. You\u2019re basically saying that the incentive to transact as rates fell by decade, kept going down and down and down. We might never reach another point where there is as strong an incentive for people to move up, or to trade, or transact. And therefore we may have hit, at least for the foreseeable future, sort of the peak amount of home sales that are going to happen in any given month or year. Is that what you\u2019re saying? Matthew:\nYeah, I think you\u2019re right. I think by my forecast, this year will probably be around 4.3 million, horrible number. Been decades since we last drove that low. Dave:\nYeah, low. Matthew:\nNext year, I\u2019d be surprised if we broke above five million. I think we\u2019ll get close to it, 4.8, maybe 4.85. So, I think kind of five million is somewhere where, which we could have a certain level of comfort going forward. But more than that, again, just logically speaking, and mathematically speaking, I think I will be surprised to see us get back to those heady levels we saw. But also remember, through the pandemic, what were we doing? We were booking out of large cities, where it\u2019d be Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and moving to Austin, Idaho, Boise, these kinds of markets. So, that really, I think pulled a lot of that demand forward already.\nSo, because of that, in addition to the fact that I just don\u2019t see\u2026 We said we\u2019re going to see rates drop over time, probably not. Anyone that thinks we\u2019re going to get back to a 3%, 30 again, I think is going to be waiting a very long time. Because unless the Fed jumps in again, that\u2019s the reason why we had rates sub-3 anyway. Then if that doesn\u2019t occur, again, it just doesn\u2019t work out because always rates have to have a relationship with the yield on 10-year treasuries. So, that means the yield on 10-year paper is going to be down around 1%, not going to happen. James:\nSo, Matthew, with the sale volume being\u2026 that\u2019s almost two million less homes being sold. You talked about earlier, that it was about 70-30 with the renters, or 65-35 with renters versus homeowners. Do you see that switching over the next 12 to 24 months, to where, as new buyers come in, they\u2019re just more comfortable being renters because there\u2019s no product to buy? And are we looking at an America that could go 50-50 renter versus ownership? Matthew:\nI don\u2019t think so. And I think that most home buyers or would be home buyers\u2026 If you think about it demographically, everyone talks about millennials, right? Well, they\u2019re getting older. As they\u2019re aging out, a lot of them are turning 40 now. But I\u2019m looking at, let\u2019s say my son, Gen Z behind them. And, well, almost 70% of them believe that buying a home will be the most astute financial investment they\u2019ll ever make. And I know the Fed, every three years, comes out with an analysis, so I\u2019m actually waiting on the latest one, which shows the median household wealth of a homeowner household versus a renter household. And the last numbers are 2019, and if memory serves me right, I think they said the median household wealth, a homeowner household was around quarter of a million dollars, and a renter household around $6,000.\nSo, I can extrapolate that out to today easily, we\u2019re looking at an owner household across America has a net wealth of probably around 320,000 renter, about eight. So, it\u2019s the way a majority of Americans create their wealth is through long-term ownership of housing. Is it for everyone? Of course no, it\u2019s not. But I think it is still a goal of a sizable part of our not just growing population, but aging population. I think about the young kids in college today. James:\nAnd it kind of shows the sign of the times. Because I remember after the 2008 crash, it was like nine, 10, and 11. The younger population had this negative stigma on owning a house, right? Their parents had just been foreclosed. Everyone was losing their properties, no one wanted real estate at all. They\u2019re like, \u201cThat is a terrible thing to own.\u201d And now you have these Gen Zs coming up, and they saw all this growth, and people having all this success. And I do feel like the first-time home buyer\u2026 I was actually talking to my title rep the other day, who works for a very large title company, Fidelity National Title. And he said, \u201c50% of all transactions that they\u2019re doing right now are first-time home buyers.\u201d\nAnd so I think that is been ingrained into that\u2026 If you want to make it in America, you have to buy that house. And so there\u2019s going to be sacrifice for your house payment. But it\u2019s crazy how much of a switch it is from watching the young buyers back then. And they were incentivized, they had that first-time home buyer credit back then, it was a great product, and people still didn\u2019t want it. And now people are just taking the leap on where pricing is at right now. Matthew:\nI mean, education is everything, right? I think people who have watched The Big Short, people who watched a lot of these movies that came out about the housing bubble, and there are three of them which are very good. So, I think it comes down to education, and the understanding of what happened back then. The genesis of the housing bubble under Clinton in the early \u201990s, all the way through Bush, et cetera, et cetera, is something which is unlikely to happen now. You think about it. Last week was the anniversary of Lehman Brothers filing a bankruptcy, which was the biggest filing in US history.\nSo, yes, there\u2019s a lot of negative connotations, but I think people understand that what happened then is very unlikely to happen again. And they\u2019re also seeing the fact that, yeah, they can own their house, guess what? They can paint their walls. It\u2019s also forced savings. Through mortgage payment, a little piece of that pie comes out paying down principle, the tax benefits, et cetera, et cetera, all the things that everyone is aware of. So, I think they\u2019re seeing that today and saying, \u201cYeah, I really think that that is the way I want to go rather than renting, and what am I doing? Paying somebody else\u2019s mortgage.\u201d Dave:\nThere are a lot of, Matthew, analysis now though that show that if you are a renter, and actually take the\u2026 It\u2019s sort of this hypothetical, right? So, if you had the money to make a down payment, and instead of buying a home, you rented and invested, say in the stock market and earned eight to 9% or whatever. Or perhaps invested in a rental property instead of a primary residence, that you would actually do better. And I actually do that myself. I rent and invest my money into rental properties, because you actually earn a better return in some markets. It depends on where you are. But I was just curious of your thoughts on that. Matthew:\nLet\u2019s talk about the stock market first, or investing in equities. And I\u2019m assuming equities, let me not talk about crypto because I\u2019m- Dave:\nNope. Matthew:\nI\u2019m kind of the Charlie Munger viewer in that respect, but- Dave:\nNot for James or I at least. Matthew:\nYeah, well, the first thing I\u2019d say is very simple, capital gains taxes. So, you\u2019d have to remember, as a married household, the first $500,000 in upside, in terms of the increased value of that home, tax-free. Dave:\nTax free. Matthew:\nNow, are the equities you\u2019re buying going to be tax-free? Guess what? No, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re now 30-plus percent on those. So, there is that. And again, in addition to that, you\u2019re paying down your mortgage, et cetera, et cetera, depending on obviously how long you are there. But more than anything else, it\u2019s shelter, and it\u2019s yours. Now, certainly as you said, Dave, \u201cThere are people like yourselves, where it makes more sense for them to still invest in real estate.\u201d Now, I could argue, you could still see, if you choose to sell that unit, the same issue regarding capital gains unless you made it your principal primary residence. Unless you kind of moved into it for a while. Dave:\nRight. Matthew:\nBut subject to that, yeah, I think that can be for some, a viable option. Again, depending on where in the country you are. But for most people, the stock market every day, it certainly acts like a petulant child more often than not. Yes, you can see those swings, those upsides, but you also can see downside as well. And is it more likely to see a recession, therefore a contraction in equity prices? Or is it as likely you\u2019ll see a contraction in home values? Dave:\nYeah. Matthew:\nYou\u2019ve only seen a couple of downsides in home values. Dave:\nNo. Yeah, yeah, totally. Way less volatility, for sure. Matthew:\nSo, again, it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all scenario at all. But I think in general market, it would be those that are saying, \u201cYou\u2019re better off if you\u2019d invested in, I don\u2019t know, Tesla or something.\u201d I would say, \u201cYes today, maybe not six months ago.\u201d But you could say that. But I think that\u2019s more cherry-picking than anything else. If you just get into an index fund, okay. I\u2019d actually never seen anyone living under a stock certificate. James:\nYeah, so Matthew, you made kind of a good point, right? \u201cThat real estate can be a lot less volatile and more dependable than the stock market,\u201d which I truly do believe. I seem to lose money on stock market, and crypto, and anything else besides real estate. Not that you can\u2019t lose money in real estate too. So, I do believe that. But in the climate that we\u2019re in right now, there\u2019s obviously risk in every type of asset class. What should we be wary of, as real estate investors? Like right now, we\u2019re out trying to buy properties to sell them for profit, keep them as rental properties. What should investors be looking out for right now, as they\u2019re looking at buying that next investment? Because we\u2019re all eager to buy, but we\u2019re a little bit cautious right now. Matthew:\nI think that there\u2019s some things which actually you gentlemen have already mentioned. And that is the fact that, is it a market that you can buy a house, and knowing that the rent you\u2019ll be able to achieve having bought it? Is there a yield there? I mean, there\u2019s a reason why institutional investors, obviously not mom-and-pop investors, which although that comprises a vast majority of the market, have they been pulling back significantly? Absolutely. I mean, they\u2019re still active in a couple of markets, but generally not.\nSo, I would say that the first thing to do is, you know what you\u2019re borrowing, you know what your payment\u2019s going to be, your rents are going to be. Does that make sense today or does it not? And so I think that\u2019s one of the first things. Secondly, I\u2019d look at the market. And is it a market that you could potentially see some additional price erosion from where we are today? And I think in the past, I guess, [inaudible 00:28:48] you\u2019ve talked about markets which are still of a concern, Austin, Texas is obviously one. I\u2019d say Boise, Idaho is another one. James:\nWe love beating up on those markets too. Matthew:\nEveryone does right now, quite frankly. It really is kind of scary. But there are markets which, and certainly Boise, which go back 15, 20 years, no one really wanted to be there. But it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s an area of last time\u2026 I go there every year now. I had to give a speech. And it reminds me of a scaled-down gas stamp district in San Diego. It\u2019s kind of hip, it\u2019s got some good restaurants, and distilleries, and breweries. It\u2019s got the most amazing convention center that\u2019s built by a company, and then given to the city for nothing. Great regional airport. So, I think it\u2019s got some good things going to it. However, a couple of years ago, you could have bought a nice house for a bit north of quarter of a million dollars. Today, we\u2019re talking north of $600,000. And that again is because of that massive flight out of some of the more expensive markets, not just here in the Northwest, but very specifically California.\nSo a couple of things that I just mentioned, one of which is there a yield? Does it make financial sense, or is it costing you money? And that would therefore mean, start looking at high property tax states and these kinds of things. Is it a market that potentially can see some further price erosion, then you might want to wait before you jump in? So, those I think are the two things that stick out to me. But in terms of being an investor and where prices are, we started out talking about affordability. We are creating a lot, a forced renter households that would like to buy, they just can\u2019t. And not just the young kids that weren\u2019t quite ready to move out of their apartment, they hadn\u2019t got a down payment ready. All they\u2019ve done is see prices go up and mortgage rates double.\nBut you look at a lot of families. Everyone assumes that if you\u2019re a family, then you rent an apartment. No, you don\u2019t, you rent a single-family home. And so these are people that might want to get their foot on the first rung of the ladder, just can\u2019t make it work. They need somewhere to live. And so, again, shelter at the long-term, is always going to be a good investment. But the worry, again, comes back to affordability. So, I\u2019d say just look at the markets in which you\u2019re choosing or you\u2019re thinking about investing in. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew, don\u2019t overleverage. All the things I would say to somebody who\u2019s looking to buy a home for themselves. Dave:\nYeah, it\u2019s really a lot of the same fundamentals that we were saying. Matthew, before we get out of here, this has been a fascinating conversation, and thank you. Is there anything else you think that our audience, primarily of those small mom-and-pop investors you just talked about, should know about the market, or factor into their decision-making over the next year? Matthew:\nYeah, I would say that when it comes to\u2026 Everyone\u2019s looking at mortgage rates, we started talking about it. But from my end, I\u2019m talking about it. Are we going to see them continue to skyrocket? I think that that is highly unlikely. But as they come down, and I expect they will. And in fact, I think we\u2019ll be down probably in the mid-fives by the latter part of next year. Just calm down, it\u2019s going to be okay. We\u2019re just in a very unique situation right now. The Fed\u2019s trying to cool inflation, and in some respects, it\u2019s working. But the resilience of the US economy has been remarkable. That is not a good thing in terms of investors or indeed analysts like myself who try and forecast mortgage rates, because we should be slowing down a bit more, but that is not the case.\nHowever, we could overshoot, or they could overshoot, keep rates higher longer, that could lead to a recession. Not a good feeling for any of us, however, good for mortgage rates, because they will drop faster than I\u2019m anticipating. So, I think really it is, we are in a situation now coming out of COVID, that we hadn\u2019t seen before in a century. No one wrote the book about it, about what was going to happen. The world is a very different place. So, I think we just need to figure that out, and let\u2019s let the seas calm down somewhat, which I think they will. But do I always think that in the right circumstance, again, not over-leveraging yourself, is owning real estate as an investment or as somewhere in which you live a good investment? Historically, it has been. And again, as an economist, I tend to look at history, not to forecast the future, I do not see that changing. But just be patient, in time, things will settle down. Dave:\nAll right, great. Well, thank you so much, Matthew, for being here. We really appreciate it. If people want to follow your research, check out your incredible in-depth reports, where should they do that? Matthew:\nWell, thank you. So, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. It\u2019s mgardnerecon. So, mgardner, G-A-R-D-N-E-R, econ, E-C-O-N. LinkedIn, mjdgardner. And that\u2019s where we put out all of our analysis. Dave:\nAll right. Well, thanks again for being here. We really appreciate it. Matthew:\nDavid, James, pleasure. James:\nYeah, thanks, Matthew. Matthew:\nYou\u2019re welcome. Dave:\nWell, I see why you wanted to have Matthew come on the show here, James. What\u2019d you think of our conversation? James:\nOh, I loved it. I mean, it was great for him to just talk about the affordability, because we\u2019re all worried about this. As investors, are we going to get to a price point where no one\u2019s going to buy or no one\u2019s going to rent? And so it was just good to get some perspective on it. But being a Pacific Northwest guy, we listen to Matthew Gardner all the time as the chief economist for Windermere. And every time he speaks, it\u2019s always a little piece of gold. Dave:\nI mean, there was a lot in there. And I think what he was talking about in terms of affordability really extends beyond even the expensive state. Quote, unquote, \u201cexpensive areas,\u201d like obviously where you are in Seattle, we talked a lot about California. But most of the country now falls under the quote, unquote, \u201cunaffordable area.\u201d Even the places people are moving in the southeast in Florida and Tennessee, and in a lot of areas of Texas, the median income cannot afford the median price home in those places.\nAnd I think that, for good reason, has\u2026 People have point to that and said, \u201cHey, things have to come back to normal.\u201d But according to Matthew, that\u2019s not necessarily true. As long as supply is as low as it is, it apparently can stay up. And I think that\u2019s a really interesting thing that I\u2019ve debated with many people, because no one knows for sure. But I think Matthew brought us some really interesting perspectives on this, and whether or not we\u2019re going to have to see an improvement in affordability in the near future here. James:\nAnd after we were getting done talking, I mean, for me, in the back of my mind, I was like, \u201cI think rent has some more growth in it.\u201d Dave:\nYou do? James:\nFor some reason, it\u2019s like if pricing keeps going up and people seem to just be making this payment, and sales are so far down, you\u2019re going to have to rent in the short term until you find that house. And so it could push rents up a little bit more. Dave:\nYeah, I think it\u2019s certain markets. I just feel like there\u2019s this big pull-forward, and household formation is just slowing down. All these people did the COVID breakup basically, like roommates, everyone wanted to go their own way. And so it just created more renter households, and that fueled a lot of the rent growth. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily going backwards, but I think that all that juice that was in rent for a while might be slowing down. But we\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t necessarily think\u2026 Rents are sticky, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to slide a lot. But I personally, if I\u2019m looking at deals right now, I underwrite pretty slow rent growth. Are you in your deals putting in rent growth, or is this a revelation you had today? James:\nNo, very minimum. I think anything we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re being very conservative. Whether it\u2019s a value rent growth, we\u2019re sticking it pretty flat. But there\u2019s certain areas that I\u2019m watching and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, there could be some rent growth.\u201d It really comes down to what is the cost for rent versus buying? And certain areas are way out of whack. And so we\u2019re still underwriting with low growth, but I think the upside\u2019s there. Dave:\nYeah, exactly. If you underwrite, find a good deal with no rent growth and then it grows, then it\u2019s good to be wrong. James:\nYes. Dave:\nAll right. Well, thanks a lot, man.

While this sounds like a simple, straightforward process to verify income, there\u2019s trouble lurking in the form of a fake pay stub.\u00a0 Indeed, some try to create pay stubs online to create fake proof of income.\u00a0 Simple Signs to Spot Fake Pay Stubs Knowing how to spot fake pay stubs can save you from a lot of hassle in the future. Here are seven signs you should look for to check stubs.\u00a0 1. Inconsistencies in numbers and data One of the most glaring signs of counterfeit stubs is inconsistent data. This may appear as miscalculations regarding a pay period, uneven totals, or discrepancies between gross pay and net pay. With a real pay stub, employers generally use standardized payroll software that automates calculations and creates pay stubs. This almost guarantees mathematical accuracy.\u00a0 If the numbers don\u2019t add up or if deductions don\u2019t seem to correlate with the gross pay, take caution. You may be dealing with fake pay stubs.\u00a0 2. Missing standard information A real pay stub will provide comprehensive details, including the employer\u2019s name, address, employee identification number, and more. If any of this standard information is missing or appears generic, it\u2019s a red flag for a fake pay stub. It\u2019s also essential to cross-check the employer\u2019s details provided with public records or directories to ensure legitimacy.       3. Poor quality or formatting Professional payroll software generates clear, organized, easy-to-read pay stubs. On the other hand, fake pay stubs may exhibit signs of poor quality, such as misaligned columns, varying fonts, or spelling errors.\u00a0 Any obvious formatting issues or lack of uniformity in presentation could be a telltale sign of a forged document. 4. Absence of deductions Real pay stubs will showcase a variety of deductions, such as insurance deductions, Medicare taxes, Social Security taxes, and retirement contributions. If a pay stub lacks these deductions or if the amounts seem unusually low or high, proceed with caution.\u00a0 Cross-reference against federal, state, and local tax rates for accuracy. This can help you quickly uncover fake stubs. 5. Too good to be true Sometimes, a pay stub might display exceptionally high earnings or bonuses that don\u2019t match the applicant\u2019s job title or industry standards. While everyone loves a success story, it\u2019s crucial to remain realistic.\u00a0 Conduct market research or consult industry guides for salary information to determine the average pay for specific roles and compare them to what\u2019s presented on the pay stub. 6. Confusion between O and zero When the letter O replaces the number 0, it\u2019s a strong indication of a fake pay stub. Companies employing payroll software rarely make this oversight. Authentic documents often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion. 7. Suspiciously rounded figures Alarm bells should ring when all earnings on a pay stub are perfectly rounded. For instance, seeing net pay as a rounded number like $1,500 instead of $1,498.05 is unusual, as precise payroll calculations seldom result in such neat figures. While these aren\u2019t the only ways to spot a fake pay stub, they\u2019re more than enough to point you in the right direction. The more tenants you screen, the easier it is to implement a strategy for reviewing pay stubs for suspicious activity. Other Ways You Can Verify Tenant Employment While requesting a pay stub is the most common way to verify potential tenant employment and provide proof of income, there are other options available to you: Direct employer verification One of the most reliable methods is to directly contact the prospective tenant\u2019s employer. Ask the tenant for the name and contact information of their immediate supervisor or the HR department. Once received, give them a call to verify employment status, verify income, and verify tenure.\u00a0 Tip: Ensure you\u2019re speaking to a legitimate representative of the company, not a friend or relative posing as an employer. Request additional documentation Beyond pay stubs that can help with income verification, there are other forms of documentation that can provide evidence of employment and earnings. These can include tax returns, bank statements, or employment contracts.\u00a0 While these documents can also be falsified, cross-referencing multiple documents can help paint a clearer picture of a tenant\u2019s financial situation. Note: Since independent contractors don\u2019t receive standard pay stubs, it\u2019s critical to request additional documentation. Requesting proof of income is a must.\u00a0 Online employment verification services Several online companies offer employment verification services. These platforms often have access to databases and can provide quick, reliable verifications. However, ensure the platform you select is reputable and known for accuracy. This is one of the quickest and most time-efficient ways to verify employment and ensure that you\u2019re not trusting a fake document for income verification.\u00a0 Check professional social networks Platforms like LinkedIn can give insights into a person\u2019s employment history and current status. While this isn\u2019t a foolproof method (since profiles can be updated or edited), it\u2019s an additional tool that can provide context or raise questions if the details don\u2019t align with what\u2019s been provided. Tip: Start with LinkedIn, but review other social media platforms\u2014such as X (formerly known as Twitter) and Facebook\u2014for employment-related information.\u00a0 Request a reference letter Ask the prospective tenant for a reference letter from their current employer. This letter should state the position held by the tenant, the duration of employment, and their monthly or yearly earnings. It should also be written on company letterhead and include contact information for verification. Check the credit report Running a credit report check can give a broader view of a tenant\u2019s financial reliability. While it doesn\u2019t confirm employment directly, regular income often results in specific patterns of financial behavior.\u00a0 For example, regular payments and a good credit score can indirectly suggest stable employment. Fake Pay Stub Frequently Asked Questions It\u2019s common to have questions about fake pay stubs. Here are some of the most common, along with comprehensive answers to help you better understand this specific challenge. What are fake pay stubs?\u00a0 Fake pay stubs are forged or altered documents that purportedly represent proof of an individual\u2019s earnings and employment, but do not accurately reflect their true income or employment status. Why would someone use a fake pay stub?\u00a0 Individuals might use fake pay stubs to deceive entities or individuals for various reasons, such as securing a rental property, obtaining a loan, or showing falsified income for illegal activities. What are the legal consequences of using fake pay stubs?\u00a0 Using fake pay stubs is illegal and can result in criminal charges, such as fraud or forgery. Those found guilty may face penalties including fines, probation, or imprisonment, depending on the jurisdiction and the severity of the offense. How are fake pay stubs made? Fake pay stubs are typically created using computer software or an online pay stub generator that allows individuals to input false income and employment details. These tools produce documents that appear legitimate but contain fabricated information. Advanced technology, such as online pay stub generators, has made it easier to create fake pay stubs. Can independent contractors use fake pay stubs? Contractors don\u2019t receive traditional pay stubs outlining gross wages, net pay, and other key details. Instead, they typically provide invoices, bank statements, or receipts to document their earnings and expenses. Remember, these individuals can still create a pay stub online to give the impression of steady income.\u00a0 Don\u2019t Let a Fake Pay Stub Trick You Managing real estate\u2014regardless of the number of properties\u2014comes with many challenges and concerns, with fake pay stubs among them. It\u2019s critical for landlords and property managers to be meticulous in their vetting processes to verify proof of income.

While this sounds like a simple, straightforward process to verify income, there\u2019s trouble lurking in the form of a fake pay stub.\u00a0 Indeed, some try to create pay stubs online to create fake proof of income.\u00a0 Simple Signs to Spot Fake Pay Stubs Knowing how to spot fake pay stubs can save you from a lot of hassle in the future. Here are seven signs you should look for to check stubs.\u00a0 1. Inconsistencies in numbers and data One of the most glaring signs of counterfeit stubs is inconsistent data. This may appear as miscalculations regarding a pay period, uneven totals, or discrepancies between gross pay and net pay. With a real pay stub, employers generally use standardized payroll software that automates calculations and creates pay stubs. This almost guarantees mathematical accuracy.\u00a0 If the numbers don\u2019t add up or if deductions don\u2019t seem to correlate with the gross pay, take caution. You may be dealing with fake pay stubs.\u00a0 2. Missing standard information A real pay stub will provide comprehensive details, including the employer\u2019s name, address, employee identification number, and more. If any of this standard information is missing or appears generic, it\u2019s a red flag for a fake pay stub. It\u2019s also essential to cross-check the employer\u2019s details provided with public records or directories to ensure legitimacy.       3. Poor quality or formatting Professional payroll software generates clear, organized, easy-to-read pay stubs. On the other hand, fake pay stubs may exhibit signs of poor quality, such as misaligned columns, varying fonts, or spelling errors.\u00a0 Any obvious formatting issues or lack of uniformity in presentation could be a telltale sign of a forged document. 4. Absence of deductions Real pay stubs will showcase a variety of deductions, such as insurance deductions, Medicare taxes, Social Security taxes, and retirement contributions. If a pay stub lacks these deductions or if the amounts seem unusually low or high, proceed with caution.\u00a0 Cross-reference against federal, state, and local tax rates for accuracy. This can help you quickly uncover fake stubs. 5. Too good to be true Sometimes, a pay stub might display exceptionally high earnings or bonuses that don\u2019t match the applicant\u2019s job title or industry standards. While everyone loves a success story, it\u2019s crucial to remain realistic.\u00a0 Conduct market research or consult industry guides for salary information to determine the average pay for specific roles and compare them to what\u2019s presented on the pay stub. 6. Confusion between O and zero When the letter O replaces the number 0, it\u2019s a strong indication of a fake pay stub. Companies employing payroll software rarely make this oversight. Authentic documents often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion. 7. Suspiciously rounded figures Alarm bells should ring when all earnings on a pay stub are perfectly rounded. For instance, seeing net pay as a rounded number like $1,500 instead of $1,498.05 is unusual, as precise payroll calculations seldom result in such neat figures. While these aren\u2019t the only ways to spot a fake pay stub, they\u2019re more than enough to point you in the right direction.

In other words, the quicker you act on maintenance tickets or implement feedback on making paying rent easier, the more likely a tenant is to renew, even if you plan on raising rent.\u00a0 One of the strongest ways to increase lease renewals is by offering tenants a renting experience that considers their feedback and addresses their complaints. In other words, the quicker you act on maintenance tickets or implement feedback on making paying rent easier, the more likely a tenant is to renew, even if you plan on raising rent.\u00a0 But exactly how can this be done? That depends on the feedback you generally receive that could impact a tenant\u2019s desire to renew. For some, this can be a non-working A\/C unit or outdated kitchen appliances. For others, this can be paying rent via checks versus online payments. The key is having a good grasp on how your tenants feel about both the rental property and adjusting where necessary.\u00a0 But exactly how can this be done?

Regularly Request Feedback From Tenants 2. Regularly Request Feedback From Tenants Requesting feedback from your tenants on a monthly or quarterly basis can provide visibility on the areas of improvement, which can increase the likelihood of your tenants renewing if immediately addressed. Requesting feedback from your tenants on a monthly or quarterly basis can provide visibility on the areas of improvement, which can increase the likelihood of your tenants renewing if immediately addressed. To collect feedback, this can be through direct contact with your tenant (if you have the time), or you can create an online form to email your tenants at a cadence you prefer. This method can make it easier to keep track of feedback, especially if managing several rental properties or tenants. Examples of questions to include in the form can be: To collect feedback, this can be through direct contact with your tenant (if you have the time), or you can create an online form to email your tenants at a cadence you prefer. This method can make it easier to keep track of feedback, especially if managing several rental properties or tenants. Examples of questions to include in the form can be: \nHow would you rate your current experience at [address] on a scale of one to 10? One being horrible and 10 being excellent.\nDo you have any feedback on your experience with our team? This could mention you as the landlord or a property manager.\u00a0\nHow likely are you to renew your lease once your existing lease expires? If not likely, please elaborate on why.\n How would you rate your current experience at [address] on a scale of one to 10? One being horrible and 10 being excellent.

Offer Incentives to Renew a Lease 3. Offer Incentives to Renew a Lease While this is not required, there are different ways to incentivize tenants to renew that can sometimes be the final nudge a tenant needs to lock in a new lease. Some examples of this are: While this is not required, there are different ways to incentivize tenants to renew that can sometimes be the final nudge a tenant needs to lock in a new lease. Some examples of this are: \nA slight percentage or dollar amount reduction to the new rent price.\nFree rent payment reporting to credit bureaus.\nWaived payment processing fees (if able).\n A slight percentage or dollar amount reduction to the new rent price.

Notify Tenants in Advance of Plans to Raise Rent Over the past few years, all-time-high rent prices have been top of mind for millions of renters, so it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re often not excited to learn about a landlord\u2019s plan of raising rent. Although this is inevitable to increase profits and cover the rising cost of managing a rental, it may be best to notify your tenants 2-3 weeks before sharing the lease renewal proposal to talk through it first.\u00a0 Over the past few years, all-time-high rent prices have been top of mind for millions of renters, so it\u2019s no surprise that they\u2019re often not excited to learn about a landlord\u2019s plan of raising rent. Although this is inevitable to increase profits and cover the rising cost of managing a rental, it may be best to notify your tenants 2-3 weeks before sharing the lease renewal proposal to talk through it first.\u00a0 You can provide your reasons for raising the rent and let your tenants share their thoughts on your plans. They may try to negotiate a lower rent price that\u2019s still above their current rent. In this case, you can decide if you\u2019re flexible on your plans to increase the chances of them renewing or will stick to your new price.\u00a0 You can provide your reasons for raising the rent and let your tenants share their thoughts on your plans.

Make the Lease Renewal Process Easier to Complete 5. Make the Lease Renewal Process Easier to Complete Automation is a landlord\u2019s best friend\u2014it helps you save time (and even money) by simplifying tasks that have historically been manual, such as lease renewals. Instead of going back and forth with tenants via email on lease renewal plans, you can leverage property management software to automate the process.

Add Improvements to the Rental Property\u00a0 Like with many things, certain characteristics or features of your rental property can be considered past its prime and time for change. If you\u2019re unable to offer incentives or make any further changes to how you manage your rental, consider improving the property itself.

For those starting out in real estate investing, you may be surprised to hear that not all lenders are open to working with investors. Real estate financing plays a significant role in the success of a rental property. Loan terms like mortgage payments, interest rates, or even down payments for a property can make or break you financially.\u00a0 What does it mean to have an investor-friendly lender on your side, and where do you find one?\u00a0 What Is an Investor-Friendly Lender? An investor-friendly lender is familiar with the real estate market and focuses on a property\u2019s potential, rather than honing in on the current market value. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re just venturing into real estate investing. You go to a bank and explain that you want to buy a property, specifically in commercial real estate. To your surprise, the bank shuts you down. Your confidence is shot, and you think every lender will say no to your potential investments. It\u2019s time to find an investor-friendly lender. A conventional lender, usually a big bank like Wells Fargo or Chase, is typically unwilling to give you money for an investment like a rental property because it\u2019s more of a risk to them. Instead, they tend to focus on financing primary residences. A private money lender is one example of a more investor-friendly lender because they consider a property\u2019s future value and provide a loan against it, compared to more conventional lenders. Also, private lenders, or smaller lenders and their loan programs, tend to be under less of a microscope, meaning investors typically have fewer hoops to jump through. If a private money lender doesn\u2019t work out for you and you need something quick without all the hustle and bustle of conventional loans, try a portfolio lender. Consider a portfolio mortgage lender if you want to bypass all the super-strict borrower requirements set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A portfolio loan allows the investor to purchase multiple properties as well. An investment property loan is very different from a conventional loan. Banks, especially local banks, love lending to those looking to finance a primary residence. The Best Ways to Find an Investor-Friendly Lender Finding an investor-friendly lender that works for you is essential. Your relationship with your lender is crucial for any potential properties you want to invest in. Here are some ways to find an investor-friendly lender. Lender Finder Technology is inevitable, and every day, more tools are being added to the real estate tech stack to help organize and simplify your next investment. Lender Finder from BiggerPockets allows you to enter details like the property\u2019s location, possibly even an address if you have one, what you want to purchase the property for, and so much more. Once the details are entered, the tool will search its database for investor-friendly lenders for you to reach out to. There is also an option to request that the lender contact you for more details. You can find a lender within minutes using Lender Finder. BiggerPockets forums Posts from BiggerPockets members within the forums ask for advice on local lenders and even basics like what interest rate to look for, the best investment property loans to get, the minimum down payment terms, and more. An experienced investor in your area can usually guide you in the right direction for a lender near you, as well as one that will best fit what you want to do. For example, do you have a rental property in mind? Get advice on which lenders to look for in your rental property\u2019s location. Interested in commercial property? Find a commercial lender that best suits your needs. Local networking From your local real estate group to something on Meetup.com, it\u2019s crucial to network locally with people in the real estate industry. Interested in learning more about rental property loans? Find a local investor who owns multiple rental properties and can tell you the ins and outs of financing and owning a rental property. After being gung ho on networking this year, I can tell you that the real estate industry and the connections within the industry are intertwined. Real estate agents, for example, have a ton of connections, from financing to insurance to property leads, so an agent tends to be an all-in-one connection. I\u2019ve also met mortgage brokers at local events who, despite being unable to finance your deal, can link you up with a lender who can. Maybe at a networking event, you meet other local investors who can refer you a contractor they love to work with or even recommend a local investor-friendly lender that would love to finance your next potential deal. Cold calling Picking up the phone can create a more personable connection than sending a text or an email. It allows both parties to get to know each other in a way that no 25-text thread ever could. So, where do you start, and who do you even cold call? If you\u2019re not one to be out and about and picking up the phone feels more comfortable, call local real estate investors currently killing it in your area. An experienced real estate investor will quickly have a list of investor-friendly lenders you should or should not contact. When cold calling, don\u2019t be afraid to chat with multiple lenders or mortgage brokers because each one will have different terms. Be sure to ask a potential lender how many loans you can have at once, the loan minimum for a property, and what kind of loans they specialize in, be it rehab loans, portfolio loans, or something else. Remember, the type of property, whether residential or commercial real estate, plays a significant role in the kind of financing you get. Social media Social media is no longer just a place to post pictures of friends or family\u2014it\u2019s perfect for networking too, especially when looking for investor-friendly lenders. For example, an investor could easily request lender recommendations from local investors. There are 4.8 billion social media users worldwide, representing 59.9% of the global population and 92.7% of all internet users. Imagine all the research opportunities there to find a lender that best works for you. Google Aside from research on a social platform or chatting with the local REI group, Google is officially its own beast. And as you know, it offers an exponential, sometimes overwhelming amount of information. When looking for a lender, read any Google reviews associated with the lender\u2019s business or name. Google reviews are a great way to gain insight into people\u2019s thoughts without actually having a conversation. If the lender has a website, you can search the different loan programs and the type of investment, like a rental property, on which the lender offers terms. Also, remember that the loan minimum depends on the property type. Benefits of Working With an Investor-Friendly Lender An investor-friendly lender has so much to offer to real estate investors. Let\u2019s dive into the benefits of working with a lender who\u2019s just as into real estate investing as you are. Simplicity Applying for a loan isn\u2019t simple, but when looking for an investment property loan, it\u2019s essential to consider the hoops you\u2019ll have to jump through to get the loan in the first place. Many real estate deals are time-sensitive, so it\u2019s essential to find a lender that doesn\u2019t have a lengthy approval process. An investor-friendly lender doesn\u2019t have the super-strict loan guidelines of conventional loans. These lenders also tend to be just as optimistic about an investment as the investor. What more could you ask for? Speed Investor-friendly lenders understand that the speed and approval of funds makes all the difference for real estate investors. These lenders are typically private investors, hard money lenders, sometimes portfolio lenders, or even private lenders. Time is of the essence for many real estate investors when buying property, especially if it\u2019s an immediate cash flow property. An investor-friendly lender can make quick decisions on investment properties and provide the necessary funding within an acceptable time frame. Convenience Investor-friendly lenders seem to appreciate and acknowledge a real estate investor\u2019s time by being overly accessible, whether handling documentation online so that their real estate investor client doesn\u2019t have to make an extra trip or being readily available. These lenders nurture a client relationship and are overtly optimistic about their client\u2019s investing future. Plus, their loan programs offer a more customized approach to financing something like a flip or a rental property. Flexibility Need a lower down payment or more leniency on cash flow? An investor-friendly lender works with you to customize a loan deal that will be best where you are financially now and not drain you entirely from where you want to be. You may need a lower minimum down payment to dedicate more cash to your investment. The nice thing about lenders on your side is that they work with you, not against you. Sure, it may mean higher interest rates for now, but if you get something like a rental property going that starts raking in reasonable cash flow, those loan terms will be old news. Ready to Connect With an Investor-Friendly Lender? Whether investing in rental properties or commercial real estate, connecting with investor-friendly lenders makes all the difference when running a real estate business. Investment property loans, especially for a newbie investor, might be confusing. If the end goal is to invest in multiple properties within the next few years, it\u2019s essential to create a dynamic professional relationship with a lender. It\u2019s essential to have a lender who offers the right loan programs, understands your needs, and works within them to give you the best possible outcome. Is a portfolio loan the best financing for your next investment? Having these conversations with a finance professional you trust is important.\u00a0Before teaming up with a lender, real estate investors must do their due diligence. Each lender will have something different to offer, so choose a lender whose loan terms work best for you.

Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Properties Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Properties With the relentless rise of interest rates in the past couple of years, investors searching for cash flow have struggled to find workable deals without being forced to commit to cash purchases or ultra-low leverage (which severely crimps the ability to scale). With the dearth of SFR (single-family rentals) available to provide cash flow as home values have stubbornly stayed elevated, even in the face of rising rates, investors have been pushed in alternative directions. For many, this has meant moving toward short-term vacation rentals, multiunit properties, or other creative forms of dealmaking.

The problem? Many (if not all) current DSCR lenders and their capital partners are hesitant to lend on these properties, even if the investment is solid. Many are burdened with the connotation of boarding houses or believe that the tenant mix may be low-quality and risky (many halfway houses operate in this way) or that the type of tenant who can only afford a room in a group home may have greater risks of missing rent or having other issues.

Many lenders are not in the business of real estate investing themselves, so they will typically want to immediately sell the foreclosed property to recover capital rather than trying to operate it as an investment.\u00a0\u00a0 Due to these reasons, many lenders are hesitant to lend on SRO properties because there is a limited buyer pool for properties that may have been altered for single-room living (door locks, split rooms, etc.) or for properties that are out of character in a market or not usable for most buyers. For example, an eight-bedroom home in a neighborhood full of three-bedroom homes is likely tough to sell, as not many families have a use or interest in a house with so many bedrooms.

If you peruse the\u00a0 BiggerPockets Private Lending forum, \u00a0you are probably familiar with a steady stream of investors searching for financing options for manufactured housing properties. The main issue is with the collateral\u2014as mentioned, the main way DSCR lenders mitigate risk is through their ability to foreclose on the real estate property in case of default. With manufactured housing, there is a heightened risk the property could be moved. While these properties are typically fixed to the land with a foundation and other permanent aspects, the properties were initially manufactured and moved to the site so they could, in many cases, be moved again. A borrower in default who could move the collateral is a problem for lenders because they could get around foreclosure, and the lender would take a large loss.

How can DSCR lenders solve this problem? Some options include leverage limits (lower LTVs available) to protect against risk and to require features and aspects that tie the home to the land, such as foundation requirements. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, the lender can require an affidavit filed with the county that legally restricts the ability to move the collateral and to classify the property as real estate.\u00a0\u00a0 How can DSCR lenders solve this problem?

How much you can borrow (the credit limit) is replenished when you repay the money you borrow.\u00a0 HELOCs are offered by banks, credit unions, loan brokers, and online lenders. Similar to credit cards, HELOCs can be used for nearly any purpose, although they are most commonly used for home remodeling projects or home additions. Some people also use them to consolidate credit card debt. Borrowing from a HELOC is very easy. Most lenders provide debit cards or checkbooks that let you make quick withdrawals. You can draw from the account as often as you like, as long as you don\u2019t go over the credit limit.\u00a0 Unlike traditional loans, HELOCs don\u2019t have fixed monthly payments. Instead, you can make interest-only payments for as long as the account is open (the draw period). If the borrowed money isn\u2019t repaid by the end of the draw period, a balloon payment may be required for the full amount due.\u00a0 Some lenders may give you the option of converting the balance into a traditional loan with a fixed repayment term and regular monthly payments. The typical HELOC draw period is 10 years, followed by a 20-year repayment period. HELOCs also have variable interest rates, which means you will need to know the current interest rate every time you borrow money. A home equity line of credit will also have closing costs, which may be 2% to 5% of the credit limit. How to Get a HELOC Obtaining a home equity line of credit is simple and can be completed in the following steps. 1. Assess your equity The amount of equity you will need for a HELOC varies depending on the lender, but is usually a minimum of 15% to 20%. Equity is the current market value of your home less the amount you owe on it.\u00a0 If the current market value of your home is $300,000, for example, and you still owe $200,000 on your mortgage, you have $100,000 in equity. 2. Research lenders Before you officially apply for a HELOC, it\u2019s a good idea to research multiple lenders to compare different interest rates, fees, and terms and conditions. This lets you determine which option is the best deal. 3. Apply for a HELOC After you have selected a lender, fill out the HELOC application to start the loan approval process. Your lender may require an appraisal of your property to determine its current market value and verify your equity.\u00a0 To ensure you can repay the money you borrow, your lender may seek additional information to verify your employment and financial information. 4. Close on the loan Similar to mortgages, home equity lines of credit must go through the closing process before you can start borrowing money. At the closing, you will sign the HELOC agreement and other documents. After the account is established, you can start making withdrawals from your new credit line.       How Much Money Can I Borrow With a HELOC? How much you can borrow with a HELOC is based on the amount of equity you have in your home, your credit score, and your current debts. Lenders will also look at your loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Depending on the lender, the amount you can borrow with a HELOC may be up to 85% of your equity. Let\u2019s say your home\u2019s current market value is $350,000, and you owe $250,000 on your mortgage. That means you have $100,000 in home equity ($350,000 \u2013 $250,000). A lender may approve you for a HELOC of up to $85,000, which is 85% of your equity. How to Pay Back a HELOC Paying back the money you borrow from a HELOC is different from an installment loan. With home equity loans, you receive lump sum payments for the full amount and then repay the money over time with fixed monthly payments, in which you\u2019ll pay interest and the principal. With a home equity credit line, however, you can borrow money as often as you like, as long as you don\u2019t go over the credit limit. You can then repay the borrowed money periodically to replenish your available credit. You also have the option with a HELOC of paying interest on the money you borrow and deferring the principal payment until the end of the draw period. Depending on your lender, you may be required to make a balloon payment on the balance, or you may be able to refinance it into a traditional loan. Using a HELOC to Purchase Real Estate Using a HELOC to buy real estate is a strategy many real estate investors use to quickly grow their portfolios. If you already own a property, you can use the equity to obtain a HELOC. You then borrow money from it to use as a down payment on another home. If you have equity of $100,000 in a property, for example, you may be able to obtain a HELOC for up to $85,000. You can then withdraw up to $85,000 to use as a down payment on the purchase of another property. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that if you do use a HELOC to buy real estate, you will have two loans to repay: the line of credit and the mortgage.\u00a0 Be sure to carefully evaluate any investment you are considering to make sure you will earn enough from it to repay the money you borrow. Pros and Cons of HELOCs Because they can be used for nearly anything, HELOCs are popular borrowing options. Before you apply for a home equity line of credit, however, consider both their pros and cons to make sure it\u2019s the best loan option for your needs. Pros If you want to convert your home\u2019s equity into money for a remodeling project or something else, there are several HELOC advantages to consider.\u00a0 The pros may include: \nLow-cost alternative to credit cards or personal loans\nThe money you borrow can be used for nearly anything\nFlexible repayment terms\nRevolving, meaning the money can be reborrowed once repaid\nTax-deductible under certain circumstances\n Cons A home equity line of credit may not be the best borrowing option for every situation.\u00a0 HELOC disadvantages may include: \nYour home serves as collateral and can be foreclosed on if you default\nClosing costs may be 2% to 5% of the credit limit\nAdjustable interest rates will fluctuate over time\n Alternatives to a Home Equity Line of Credit A homeowner may use a home equity line of credit or a cash-out refinance instead of a HELOC. Personal loans and credit cards are also options to consider. Although they are convenient, you may pay a much higher interest rate with a credit card than with other borrowing options. HELOC vs. home equity loan HELOCs and home equity loans both use a property\u2019s equity as collateral and have closing costs. A HELOC, however, is a revolving line of credit, while a home equity loan is an installment loan where you make fixed monthly payments on the money you borrow. Home equity loans and HELOCs both allow you to tap into the equity in your home, but how you repay the money you borrow is different. A HELOC lets you borrow, repay, and borrow again, while a home equity loan is a lump-sum loan.\u00a0 In addition, the interest rate charged on HELOC funds is typically variable, while a home equity loan has a fixed interest rate. HELOC vs. cash-out refinance The loan option you choose will determine how you pay interest on the money you borrow. With a HELOC, you obtain a line of credit that uses a home\u2019s equity that you can draw from as needed.\u00a0 With a cash-out refinance, however, you obtain a new mortgage for your home. The new mortgage will be for a higher amount than what you owe on your home. The extra cash you borrow can be used for whatever you like. A cash-out refinance may be preferable when there are rising interest rates. Because HELOCs have variable interest rates, you can\u2019t predict how much you will pay for the money you borrow. With a cash-out refinance, however, you can lock in the interest rate when the loan is created, which helps with budgeting. Should You Use a HELOC? HELOCs are best suited for when you need to periodically borrow money, like when you are rehabbing a home. With a rehab project, you may need to borrow money to buy new flooring, for example. When you are ready for the next phase of the rehab, you can then borrow more. A HELOC may also be a great borrowing option for real estate investors because it allows you to make interest-only payments during the draw period.\u00a0 If you are using the fix-and-flip strategy, for example, you can borrow the money you need to rehab a home, make interest-only payments, and then repay the borrowed money after you sell it. A home equity loan may be a better borrowing option when rising interest rates are a concern. It allows you to lock in the interest rate when the loan is created and make fixed monthly payments over a fixed term. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) FAQs Although HELOCs are good borrowing options for many purposes, they may not be ideal for everything. Here are some frequently asked questions to help you decide whether a HELOC is the best loan for your needs. How much equity do you need for a HELOC? The amount of equity you will need for a HELOC will vary depending on the lender. Most lenders require that you have at least 15% to 20% equity in a home before they will approve you for a HELOC. How long does it take to get a HELOC? How long it takes to get a HELOC is another factor that varies depending on the lender. It may take anywhere from two weeks to two months from the time you submit a HELOC application to the closing. During this time, your financial information will be verified and evaluated, and your home will be appraised. Is HELOC interest tax deductible? Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, interest paid on a HELOC is tax deductible under certain conditions. The money you borrow must be used for home improvements on the property used as collateral. Interest charged on money you borrow for other things, like college tuition, debt consolidation, or a vacation, isn\u2019t tax deductible. Can you refinance a HELOC? Some HELOCs require balloon payments at the end of the draw period and don\u2019t automatically convert into repayment periods. If you have a HELOC that requires a balloon payment, you may be able to refinance it into a conventional loan to take advantage of a fixed interest rate and a fixed repayment term.
