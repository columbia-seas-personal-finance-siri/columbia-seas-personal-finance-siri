These include Auto Scores and Bankcard Scores from each credit agency.\u00a0A full list of 28\u00a0score versions available from MyFICO can be seen\u00a0here. \u00a0All 28\u00a0scores are included\u00a0when buying the\u00a03-Bureau Report,\u00a0or when buying the Advanced or Premier\u00a0subscription plans. \u00a0==================================================================\u00a0\u00a0One of the first things a newcomer to this board learns is the difference\u00a0between FICO and FAKO scores. FAKO refers to the non-FICO scores offered\u00a0by various companies. FAKO scores have little value since few of them are used by lenders and they do not match closely to FICO scores.\u00a0But even when you stick with FICO scores, confusion can ensue because FICO scores have many different editions, versions, and variations. On a single day, a consumer could theoretically have dozens of different FICO scores, depending on which version and credit agency is used to produce the score.\u00a0This post provides a summary of the various\u00a0FICO versions. Please offer any corrections or updates, and they\u00a0will be edited in.\u00a0\u00a0***********************************************\u00a0\u00a0The FICO scoring model with its familiar range of 300 to 850 was first introduced in 1989. Since then, FICO has released six major revisions: \u00a0 1995, 1998, 2004, 2008, 2014, and 2020. \u00a0Each \"edition\" uses a different formula and produces a different score.\u00a0When a new FICO edition is released, many lenders continue using an older version for years before \"upgrading.\" The 1995 revision is no longer in common use, but later editions are still used by lenders.\u00a0Some FICO editions are commonly known by the year of introduction: \u00a0FICO 98, FICO 04, and FICO 08 (although FICO now calls it FICO Score 8, without the zero).\u00a0The most recent edition is\u00a0FICO Score 10\u00a0introduced in 2020.\u00a0As of 2020, FICO Score 8 is the most commonly used. However, most mortgage lenders use\u00a0FICO 04\u00a0for Equifax and Transunion, and\u00a0FICO 98\u00a0for Experian.\u00a0In addition to the \"classic\" version, FICO offers \"Industry Option\" versions customized for auto\u00a0loans, credit cards, installment loans, personal finance loans, and insurance. These have a score range of 250 to 900, so the\u00a0scores are not\u00a0fully comparable with \"classic\" versions.\u00a0Auto and Bankcard scores are available\u00a0from myFICO as described here. \u00a0Citibank provides the Equifax FICO 8 Bankcard score free each month to credit cards\u00a0holders.\u00a0Each credit agency (Transunion, Equifax, and Experian) uses a customized version of each FICO edition. As a result, a consumer's FICO scores from each agency may differ even when all credit information is identical among the agencies.\u00a0Because there are many FICO versions, when a score is received, it's helpful to know which version it is. If a lender provides a credit score, ask for details such as which credit agency was used, which FICO edition was used, and whether the score is an Industry Option version. The lender may not always be willing or able to provide the answers, but it doesn't hurt to ask.\u00a0\u00a0Special note about \"real-world\" score ranges:\u00a0When providing information to consumers, FICO always says\u00a0the range for standard or \"classic\" scores is 300 to 850. However a little known fact is that the actual, real-world score range is\u00a0not 300 to 850 for all FICO classic versions.\u00a0For many years, the real-world score ranges were known only to financial professionals and rarely disclosed to consumers.\u00a0In 2009, a change in federal credit laws required greater disclosure of information to credit applicants. As a result, the real-world score ranges began to appear on documents credit applicants received from lenders.

He said to give it about 10 days.\u00a0I faxed in the good will letter on the 3rd and today I woke up to several alerts from Credit Karma and Credit Seasme.\u00a0The alerts for both said a delinquent account has been updated to current, however, my EQ and TU scores have gone from 760 to 712 (EQ) and 755 to 688 (TU) on Credit Karma while no change (so far) on Credit Seasme.\u00a0My actual FICOs as of last night were 720-EX, 715-TU and 697-EQ (I did a dispute the previous month on the charge off which caused it to re-report and only EQ took a hit 711 to 685, but has recovered 12 points back). I paused my subscription so I don't know how my actual FICOs look now, although the Experian app still shows 720 and I haven't paused that one.\u00a0On CK, it shows current and paid with no charge off or collection verbiage. Although, it shows lates in the 30/60/90 for EQ. On the TU report, it shows 0 on the 30/60 but on the 90 is says 120-149 late. Status says current (and everything now shows a green check mark) with the last payment of June 22, 2023 but shows a late payment in June.\u00a0Is this a temporary hit, or am I actually worse off doing the GW letter? I had a decent bump paying the charge off, but now my score tanked and I'm worried I'll look worse to potential creditors than I did before.\u00a0TLDR: was I better off having the charge off sit on my account, or will my score recover and be better than before soon?0\tEX8- 691 EQ8- 698 TU8- 689EX9- 685 EQ9- 718 TU9- 687", "label": "Understanding FICO\u00ae Scoring", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Understanding-FICO-Scoring/Massive-score-drop-after-successful-good-will-letter/td-p/6693404"}, {"title": "EX settled CO Removed- Expected Score Increase", "date": "2023-09-07 11:43:00", "content": "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy last baddie, a settled CO, was scheduled to fall off my reports last month due to NYS's 5 year early purge rule.

I was just wondering about this post from 2019\u00a0The known thresholds are 8.9%, 28.9%, 48.9%, 68.9%, and 88.9% (maxed). Actually, that's simplifying things a bit. Exactly 9% should be OK, but you'd hate to miscalculate by a penny or two and have 9.0000001% turn into 10% for scoring purposes.\u00a0\u00a028.9% is considered \"reponsible\" borrowing, and it generally puts one in the second best scoring tier. If cards that report positive balances are at 28.9% or below, your report will look good.\u00a0\"The general wisdom is that overall utilization of 8.9% or below, individual card utilization of 28.9% or below, and a single card reporting a balance will optimize the revolving portion of one's score. Individual card utilization is determined by the card with the highest utilization.\u00a0Some have reported being dinged at less than 8.9%/28.9%, though, and we haven't really pinpointed why.That's why we recommend AZEO (a single card reporting a tiny positive balance) when one needs every possible point and hasn't done the testing to see how his profile reacts to balances.\"\u00a0I am looking to update myself on these since I am getting ready for applying for new cards and my ficos are high, but you know how it is..

What To Do to Protect Yourself", "date": "2013-04-13 10:16:00", "content": "\u00a0First and foremost, you should determine if you are indeed a victim:\u00a0Look for the following items:\u00a0New accounts that you do not recognize appear on your credit reportMost identity thieves will try to open new accounts, such as a credit card, in your name. When this happens, your credit report reflects that a new \"account\" was opened. Check your credit report on a regular basis so that you can see if there are any unrecognizable accounts that were opened in your name. You are entitled to one free credit report each year from www.annualcreditreport.com.If you pull your free annual reports you should carefully review the Names, addresses, and social security numbers that are associated with the file.\u00a0 Many times, the identity theif will apply for credit using your name and social security number, and will supply their address.\u00a0 In this way, credit cards, utilities, and even loans can be opened, and all of the mailings associated with the new account will go to the thief\u2019s address.\u00a0There are unexplained withdrawals and charges on your banking, or credit card statements.Identity thieves can tap into your current banking and credit card accounts by taking money from your bank account or by making a purchase with your credit card. All they have to do is call the bank and request online access by using your identity information such as your birthdate, social security number, and mother\u2019s maiden name.\u00a0 Many times, the identity thief is someone we know or are even related to.\u00a0 Sometimes it can be a worker who has access to your home or property, such as a cleaning lady or a handyman.\u00a0 To avoid this type of identity theft, read through your statements carefully each month and call your bank or credit card company if there are questionable withdrawals or purchases.\u00a0 The more often you look at your financial statements, the better the chances are that you\u2019ll notice unauthorized charges or fraudulent activity.\u00a0You haven't received your bills, statements or other important mail in a long time.Identity thieves sometimes call your bank, Credit Card Company or lender to change your mailing address. This allows them to run up charges without you noticing for a while since you are not receiving statements in the mail.\u00a0You've received calls from debt collection agencies about products or services you didn't buy.Thieves can use your personal information to apply for loans or a credit card in your name. This usually leads to unpaid bills that a debt collection agency will try to collect from you. \u00a0In some cases, the thief can use your identity to solicit medical services, or give your information to a cop if they are stopped for speeding. Many times, the thief will give the medical provider your address, or their address.\u00a0 You may not know about the activity until you are issued a warrant, or if you are stopped by a cop for an un-related matter.\u00a0 In order to review your traffic history report, contact your insurance carrier.\u00a0 Ask them to review your traffic violation history with you, to determine if the information is correct.\u00a0 If your carrier tells you about incidents that you don\u2019t remember, or were not involved in, you should immediately contact the police department who handled the incident.\u00a0What to do if you have determined that you are a victim of Identity Theft?\u00a0Step 1:\u00a0 Immediately contact the three credit reporting bureaus:\u00a0Equifax\u00a0 1-800-525-6285Experian\u00a0 1-888-397-3742TransUnion\u00a0 1-800-680-7289\u00a0Ask them to place an Initial Fraud Alert on your credit report.An initial fraud alert can make it harder for an identity thief to open more accounts in your name. When you have an alert on your report, a business must verify your identity before it issues credit, so it may try to contact you. The initial alert stays on your report for at least 90 days. You can renew it after 90 days. It allows you to order one free copy of your credit report from each of the three credit reporting companies. Be sure the credit reporting companies have your current contact information so they can get in touch with you.\u00a0According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 605A, an initial fraud alert will be active for 90 days, with no further documentation required. \u00a0\u00a7 605A. Identity theft prevention(a) One call Fraud Alerts(1) Initial alerts. Upon the direct request of a consumer, or an individual acting on behalf of or as a personal representative of a consumer, who asserts in good faith a suspicion that the consumer has been or is about to become a victim of fraud or related crime, including identity theft, a consumer reporting agency described in section 603(p) that maintains a file on the consumer and has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester shall -(A) include a fraud alert in the file of that consumer, and also provide that alert along with any credit score generated in using that file, for a period of not less than 90 days, beginning on the date of such request, unless the consumer or such representative requests that such fraud alert be removed before the end of such period, and the agency has received appropriate proof of the identity of the requester for such purpose; and(B) refer the information regarding the fraud alert under this paragraph to each of the other consumer reporting agencies described in section 603(p), in accordance with procedures developed under section 621(f).(2) Access to free reports. In any case in which a consumer reporting agency includes a fraud alert in the file of a consumer pursuant to this subsection, the consumer reporting agency shall -(A) disclose to the consumer that the consumer may request a free copy of the file of the consumer pursuant to section 612(d); and(B) provide to the consumer all disclosures required to be made under section 609, without charge to the consumer, not later than 3 business days after any request described in subparagraph (A).\u00a0The good news is that the consumer does not have to actually be a victim yet to ask for an initial fraud alert.\u00a0 If you have lost your wallet, or if you believe your information may have been compromised by a cyber-security breach by a financial institution, you can request this initial fraud alert at no cost to you.\u00a0 The fraud alert entitles you to access to a free credit report, as described in blue above.\u00a0Step 2:\u00a0 File appropriate Identity Theft Reports with Law Enforcement, Postal Service, and FTC.\u00a0Having the identity theft report filed with law enforcement is the next step, especially if there are addresses, social security numbers, variations of your name, and other personal identity information that is not yours on your credit report.\u00a0Appropriately filed reports with the FTC, Law Enforcement, and the United States Postal Service will allow you to receive important benefits associated with having the erroneous information \u201cblocked\u201d from your credit file.

If you have credit or loan accounts, those accounts, and how you pay them, are included in your credit report. It\u2019s important to review your credit report at least once a year so you know what your creditors are saying about you.Understanding your credit report can be confusing, especially if you\u2019re reading it for the first time. Here is a breakdown of the types information contained in your report.\u00a0\u00a0Personal Identification Information\u00a0Personal information including your name, address, and place of employment is used to identify you. Previous addresses and places of employment might also be included.It\u2019s not uncommon to have variations or misspellings of your name. Most credit reporting agencies leave these variations to maintain the link between your identity and the credit information. Having different variations of your name and old addresses won't hurt your credit score as long as it's actually your information. Make sure personal information is identifying you and not someone else.\u00a0 If you see addresses and names that you don\u2019t recognize, try disputing this information first, and consider placing a Fraud Alert on your credit reports.\u00a0Credit Summary \u00a0The credit summary section of your credit report summarizes information about the different types of accounts you have. This section lists the total number, balance, number current, and number of delinquent accounts. It will include the following account types:\u00a0Real estate accounts: Mortgages, Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) Over a certain $ value, 2nd MortgagesRevolving accounts: Usually credit cards and lines of creditInstallment accounts: Auto Loans, Student Loans, Personal Loans, Secured LoansOther accounts:\u00a0 American Express Charge CardsCollection accounts:\u00a0 Collection Agency accounts reported\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The summary includes the following information for each of the five types of accounts---\u00a0Count: Total number of accounts you have in the given category.Balance: Total amount you owe on all accounts in the category.Payment: Total monthly payments you must make on all accounts in the category.Current: Number of accounts in the category that are properly paid.Delinquent: Number of accounts in the category for which payments are past due.Derogatory: Number of accounts in the category that negatively impact your credit rating.Unknown: Number of accounts in the category whose condition was not reported by the credit bureau.This section also summarizes your open accounts, closed accounts, public records, and inquiries---\u00a0Open/Closed Accounts: A total number of all accounts that are either open or closed.Public Records: A count of any public records in your name, and the total amount of money involved for all public records. Public records may include judgements against you in civil actions, state or federal tax liens, and/or bankruptcies.Inquiries: An inquiry appears when an organization such as a bank or retail store requests a copy of your credit report. This number reflects how many inquiries were made on your credit report within the last two years.\u00a0Account History\u00a0The account history section of your credit report contains the bulk of the information. This section includes each of your credit accounts and details about how you've paid. Your account history will be very detailed, but it's important that you read through to make sure the information is being reported correctly.Each account will contain the several pieces of information.\u00a0Creditor name of the institution reporting the information.Lender Industry\u00a0 of the CreditorAccount number associated with the account. The account number may be scrambled or shortened for privacy purposes.Account Type, i.e. revolving account, education loan, auto loan, Other.Responsibility. This indicates whether you have individual, joint, or authorized user responsibility for the account.Monthly payment is the minimum amount you are required to pay on the account each month.Date opened. The month and year the account was established.Date reported is the last date the creditor updated the account information with the credit bureau.Balance. The amount owed on the account at the time data was reported. If you pay down credit cards, the balance will not update on your report, until your credit card issuer updates the data supplied to the Credit Reporting Agency.Credit limit or loan amount:\u00a0 The total available amount of credit on the account.High balance or high credit is the highest amount ever charged on the credit card. For installment loans, high credit is the original loan amount.Past due. Amount past due at the time the data was reported.Remarks are comments made by the creditor about your account.Payment status. Indicates the status of the account, i.e. current, past due, charge-off. Even if your account is current, it might contain information about previous delinquencies.Payment history. Indicates your monthly payment status since the time your account was established.Collection accounts may appear as part of the account history or in a separate section. Where it appears depends on the company providing your credit report.\u00a0The Lender Industry code used in your credit report can also impact your credit score.\u00a0 Certain types of accounts can be labeled as \"Consumer Finance Accounts\"\u00a0 Too many of these types of accounts can cause a score to drop.Here is a table with the industry codes for transunion, as reported by Freddie Mac:\u00a0Your 24 Month Payment History will be listed on the account.\u00a0 For each month of reporting, you will have a code.\u00a0 The codes are:\u00a0OK \u2013 This account is paid on time and in full.NO \u2013 No data is available for a particular month. This is usually because either the account was not open or the creditor has not reported information to Experian in a given month.30/60/90/120 \u2013 The number of days the account has been past due.KD \u2013 This stands for 'Key Derogatory' which can mean many things including: Claim, Term Default, Government Claim, Paid by Dealer, Bankruptcy Chapter 7, 11 or 12 Petitioned, or Discharged and Bankruptcy Chapter 7, 11, or 12 Reaffirmation of Debt Rescinded.RF \u2013 Property related to this account has been repossessed or foreclosed.PP \u2013 The creditor has established a revised payment plan with you.\u00a0Make sure that the information in this section is accurate. Pay especially close detail to any information related to delinquency, collections or past due accounts either in the the account details area or in the 24 month payment history as all of these things negatively impact your credit report and credit score.Make sure all of your accounts in good standing are represented. Not all creditors report account data to all credit bureaus, so\u00a0the Credit Reporting Bureau\u00a0may not have access to information on all of your positive account information (of course, this means that they may not have access to negative account information as well). If you don't see an account listed in your\u00a0credit report that you believe to be in good standing then contact your creditor and ask them if they report your account information to the Credit Reporting Bureaus.Make sure you recognize all of the creditors and accounts listed in this section. Any unrecognized accounts could mean that your financial information may have been compromised and that identity thieves may have opened accounts in your name.Keep in mind that different creditors report information in different cycles so some information, such as the balance listed on your account, may not be totally up-to-date. This is OK as long as you have verified that it is an account that you recognize and that the information listed was accurate at some point in the recent past. If you don't see this type of information update over time it is a good idea to contact your creditor to see if there are any problems with your account or ask what schedule they report your account information to\u00a0the Credit Reporting Bureaus.\u00a0\u00a0Correcting Errors: Credit reports often contain mistakes that lower the subject's credit score. Perhaps the most common is the inclusion of someone else's accounts which can also be known as a \"merged file\". Sometimes, half of the borrowers accounts are missing, this is known as a \"split file\".\u00a0 If this is happening to you, you will have to contact the bureau directly in order to fix the reporting\u00a0error. \u00a0Borrowers who find mistakes must take the initiative to get them fixed, which means writing to the\u00a0Credit Reporting Bureau\u00a0reporting the erroneous information and detailing the particulars of the error.Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), a Credit Reporting Bureau has 30 days from the day it receives your dispute\u00a0to complete its investigation and report back to you, \u00a0the borrower. The report must indicate that the error was corrected, or there was no error, or the credit grantor did not respond, in which case the disputed item is dropped from the report.\u00a0 For more information about correcting errors, feel free to visit the Rebuilding Forum. \u00a0Because fixing errors takes time, it is a good idea for borrowers to check their credit well in advance of entering the credit market or applying for\u00a0an important loan such as a mortgage loan or auto loan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Public Records\u00a0Public records include information like bankruptcies, judgments, tax liens, state and country court records, and, in some states, overdue child support. Depending on the type of account, a public record can remain on your credit report between 7-10 years. Only severe financial blunders appear in this section, not criminal arrests or convictions. Because public records can severely damage your credit, it's best to keep this section clear.If a prior judgment has been DISMISSED, or VACATED, you can have this Public Record account removed using the Dispute process.\u00a0 A SATISFIED Judgment can remain on your report and causes the same FICO effect as an un-paid judgment.For each public record, some or all of the following information may appear---\u00a0Type: The type of record, be it a Tax Lien, Legal Item, Bankruptcy, Wage Item, Judgment, etc.Status: Current status of the record.Date Filed/Reported: Date when the record was initially filed or created.How Filed: The role that you play in the record, usually the record is either filedIndividually or Jointly.Reference #: Identifying number for the record.Closing/Released Date: Date when the record was closed or the judgment awarded.Court: The court or legal agency that has jurisdiction over the record.Amount: Dollar amount of the lien or judgment.Remarks: If there are any remarks by you or the court included in the public record information, these remarks will appear here.If the Public Record is a Bankruptcy, three other fields will be visible---\u00a0Liability: The amount the court found you to be legally responsible to repay.Exempt Amount: A dollar amount claimed against you, but an amount in which the court has decided you are not legally responsible.Asset Amount: The dollar amount of total personal assets used in the court's decision.\u00a0 The Asset Amount can include items of value that can be used to pay debts.\u00a0Inquiry Information\u00a0The INQUIRY INFORMATION section lists details about each inquiry that has been made into your credit history. Details include the name of the creditor or potential creditor who made the inquiry and the date when the inquiry was made.An inquiry appears when an organization such as a bank or retail store requests a copy of your credit report. These requests can only be made if you have a credit granting relationship or are applying for credit with the organization. The requestor's name will appear on your credit report, allowing you to monitor who accessed your credit report.\u00a0Please Note: An excessive number of inquiries may adversely affect your creditworthiness. However, inquiries you personally have made via AnnualCreditReport.com or MyFico.com are considered to be \u201csoft inquiries\u201d that will not negatively impact your credit standing.\u00a0If you have never seen your Credit Report,Start with pulling your FREE Credit Report's from annualcreditreport.com. They tend to have more info on them than ones from a 3rd party. The Credit Reports from annualcreditreport.com, come directly from each of the CRA's. You can pull 1 Free Credit Report from TU, EQ and EX every 12 months.Save your money and Don't Buy the Scores, they are what we call FAKO's.Best of Luck to Everyone, as they start / continue their Journey!FICO 9: Filed Chapter 13 on 6/1/2017 after job loss.

All the info here comes from fellow MyFICO'rs posts. It is also aimed at Personal Credit Cards (VS/MC/DC/AX), and it does include 2 popular store card exceptions (Macy's & Target).\u00a0\u00a0GRID #1\u00a0= This list calls out which CRA (credit reporting agency) was pulled based on specific statesGRID #2\u00a0= This list calls out which version of the credit report we're seeing pulled with consistent regularity (Fico 8, Fico 9, or even mortgage scores like EX2, EQ5, etc.). Learn more about FICO scores here\u00a0Your Guide To Credit Scoring\u00a0Please approach this understanding this info is for educational purposes, and nothing is guaranteed. This is a YMMV situation.\u00a0\u00a0HOW TO READ THE GRIDS:Green Check Mark: Some banks are very consistent with which CRA/Version they pull. These are those \"religiously\u00a0consistent\"' pullersYellow Exclamation Point: Some banks bounce between 2 CRA's, but which one they pull unpredictably varies based on where you live along with the specific card. It just means \"prepare that it could be either one of the bureau's\"Green Check Mark + Yellow Exclamation Point: It means that a large part of the time they lean towards the green checkmark, but at times will fall to a secondary report (locked reports, bank errors when trying to pull their primary option, split credit profiles, residency, etc)GRID #1 - WHICH REPORT IS PULLED BASED ON YOUR STATE (reporting from MyFICO users)?\u00a0\u00a0GRID #2 - WHICH VERSION ARE THEY USING (reporting scoring model)?\u00a0KEEP THIS IN MIND:\u00a0This post calls out which report will likely get pulled when you apply for a credit card, but there are many more things considered during the application process. These items can include things such as:A banks sensitivity\u00a0to recent inquiries or newly opened accounts (I.E - US Bank, Wells Fargo, Chase, etc.)Your Income (and for some banks and credit unions, your total open debt)A banks level of forgiveness\u00a0for prior behavior (previous delinquencies, charge-offs, bankruptcy, repo's, etc.)A banks sensitivity\u00a0to how much available credit you already have (more common with credit unions)Your credit report age (some banks don't like to the be first to risk big limits, or any limit, on you -- \"younger\" profiles)The state you live in (most banks have contracts with a specific\u00a0CRA(s) and it covers a multi-state area)Other Notes:Citi Bank:\u00a0Some members (like folks brand new to a Citi relationship, as a sample) have reported regular double-pulls, but this has not applied to everyone. When that happens be prepared for any combo (EQ/TU , EQ/EX, EX/TU)Chase Bank:\u00a0Some users have reported that double-pulls are consistent, but some have also reported only single-pulls for all new account. CLI's are single pulls. Expect a double pull, EQ & EX seem to be the preferred combo based on approval threads, but if you get prequalified via Credit Journey, TU seems to be the primary CRA pulled and it gets paired with EQ or EX. TU seems to be the least preferred CRA for Chase when Credit Journey is not involved. \u00a0Comenity Bank: This bank has 2 core flavors of cards (\"majors\" vs \"minors\" if you will). Majors could be viewed as co-branded cards that offer a Visa/MC option. When applying for one of these, EX is the go-to. For store-cards that do not have the Visa/MC option, EQ is the go-to. This is a YMMV scenario, but the trends are thereNavy FCU:\u00a0Navy uses TU9 for new account HPs.

This individual is gainfully employed in the U.S. and earns a steady income. Their heartfelt desire is to financially assist their family, who resides in India, in a meaningful way. To achieve this, they are contemplating a cross-border financial strategy that involves issuing credit cards to their family members in India, leveraging the individual's U.S.-based income and credit history. The primary objective is to empower their family members in India to spend.Specifics:1)The credit cards will be exclusively issued to family members in India, facilitating their transactions and expenditures within India.2)The credit limits and eligibility criteria for these cards would primarily hinge on the income and credit history established by the individual in the United States.3)The individual intends to meticulously manage and settle all credit card bills promptly from the United States, thereby ensuring that the credit card debt is consistently paid off in full.My Questions:1)In the context described, is it indeed feasible to assist one's family in India through this unique financial arrangement? I kindly request your valuable insights and expertise on this matter.2)Will the family members in India be eligible to enjoy any credit card rewards, or will these benefits accrue solely to the individual in the United States?3)Is it accurate to presume that the credit score of the individual in the United States will be impacted in any way by this cross-border financial initiative? Please share more insights into it.4)Are there any prospective legal or financial considerations that demand attention within this cross-border financial arrangement?5)Could the favorable payment history established through these credit cards potentially influence the credit scores of family members in India?6)Are there any specific considerations or best practices that should be observed to optimize the effectiveness of this financial strategy?I wholeheartedly understand that navigating cross-border financial matters can be intricate.

of 20.63 percent.47 percent of all U.S. cardholders are now carrying balances from month to month.The average credit card debt level in the United States continues to grow.Most Americans are not running up credit card debt because they are making frivolous purchases.The number of credit card delinquencies in the U.S. has surged dramatically over the past two years.One recent survey discovered that many Americans that actually use personal loans to consolidate credit card debt end up quickly running up new credit card balances close to their previous levels.At a time when economic

Stocks tumbled across the banking industry as a whole.\u00a0Moody's says the banks \"remain vulnerable to nervous depositors and investors, risks from higher interest rates, and a weakening commercial real estate market.\" Which is basically the same thing that took down Silicon Valley, Signature, and First Republic banks -- they locked up too much money in long-term investments like 30 year treasuries or mortgages, and as interest rates rose and new bonds were issued with much higher rates, the resell value of those long term investments plummeted. So when investors got scared and started pulling out their money, they couldn't cover it.

But to hit the highlights: Amex introduced a product aimed at small and medium sized businesses called Premium Wire, where Amex would wire a payment to a payroll company for a fee ranging from 1.77% to 3.49%. In return, the customer would receive 1 MR point per dollar wired, which could be redeemed for 1.25% CB into a Charles Schwab account.\u00a0This wouldn't normally be a very good trade off, but Amex promoted the fee as a business deduction, which could reduce the fee enough for the company to have a positive return. In addition, the MR points could be earned by individuals, so Amex promoted this as an opportunity for business execs to grow their own personal wealth at their company's expense.\u00a0A small sales unit of several hundred Amex employees promoted this heavily, leading to multi-million dollar commissions.\u00a0This was all ethically and legally dubious, and has apparently led to several investigations, though they don't seem to have gone anywhere (the article is very vague on this). The question is whether the small sales unit was a rogue group who acted outside of company policy (Amex's company line), or whether they were acting under the instructions of senior management, and are being used as scapegoats (according to the whistleblowers).\u00a0Most of the small unit have been fired or laid off, and the others have been reassigned to less lucrative positions. Their commissions have been canceled. They were forced to sign gag orders in order to get severance packages, or reassignment bonuses, so nobody's talking publicly.

As we worked through what a full zero-based budget might look like, it became clear that we could spend the full total but that doesn't account for saving for a tax bomb on her huge (say $500k) student loans or for her other goals (rental properties/passive income and private practice).

My dad is very traditional and don't like the online banks but whatever. So, the first rep I talked to said that she's going to do a cashier's check. She said I should be getting 2 emails, never got any emails. She said if I don't get an email then to call them. I don't know why I waited 2 full days but I thought the fedex person would come with my check... I decided to call them, to see the status, they said something about I need to give my name, access #, photo id, 3 signatures, etc. and so the nearest branch is about 1hr away. I don't want to drive over there, and there's not even a local # that I could call. I didn't want to question the rep but I was confused as to what's the problem and why do they need more additional information...\u00a0\u00a0I then looked on the holds of bank account on chase website and it's to protect from organized crime, cyberhack, etc. but I wish somebody would have sent me an email instead of waiting and calling...

This is not an endorsement of Zurp; my personal (worthless) opinion based on just instinct is that they are honest but could fall apart at any moment.\u00a0Pointless backstory: I was interested in the fintech Enzo, and now Zurp seems to be its successor. Enzo fell apart and sort of partnered with Zurp on its way out, and now Zurp seems to be working on a similar business model to Enzo.

It's backed by First Pryority Bank, which I've never heard of but is allegedly FDIC-insured.Rent rewards: Anyway, Zurp has a number of rewards gimmicks including rewards on rent payments. Since this is pretty rare (Bilt is the only other one I know and I think the point value is lower for near-cash redemption options), I figured it might be worth looking into despite all the issues with it.Payment methods: Right now I think they only support ACH, and I'm guessing that's how it's going to stay. However, in an email response to me they did say that they planned to roll out support for rewards on rent checks as well in a month or so. I'll believe it when I see it.Redemption options: They don't give cash back but per this review they will give gift cards for Amazon or Target, which for me is just as good. I admit that I couldn't figure that out from the Zurp site because I got boomer fatigue trying to navigate it.

worth the extra $$$?", "date": "2023-08-03 09:00:00", "content": "My name is Jason, and I am a male in my 30s living alone in the Chicago area.\u00a0 Like many people, I am looking to get into the world of travel cards.\u00a0 I recently travelled on a solo 2.5 week vacation to England, spending around $4,000 on airfare (business class), $3,500 on hotels, $1,200 on restaurants and $400 on other travel (i.e. trains & buses), along with a few other things for a trip total of $9,000 - $10,000.\u00a0 I really enjoyed the trip, and I plan on doing trips like this once per year for a long period of time.\u00a0 I am already planning on going on similar yearly 2-2.5 week trips to southwest England, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the Northeastern US cities (Boston/New York/Philadelphia).\u00a0In addition, I typically take 1-2 domestic leisure flights with family per year, typically flying in economy (or economy plus) and travelling for 3-7 days.\u00a0 Those trips typically cost around $1200-$2000, with airfare around $500-$600.\u00a0 Therefore, I am looking at a travel budget of $10,000 - $14,000 on a yearly basis.\u00a0Outside of the trips, I don't spend very much money, especially for material goods.\u00a0 My main expenses on my credit cards are groceries (~$200/month), restaurants (~$200/month), ride-hails on Lyft (~$50/month), and sporting events (~$125/month).\u00a0While my income isn't very high (~$80,000 - $90,000/year pre-tax), I have no car, children, rent, or mortgage, as my condo is completely paid off.\u00a0 I have no major expenses (i.e. children, car, second home) planned, so I can easily afford to splurge on the vacations.\u00a0 I do like travelling on business/first class on long-haul flights, as it enables me to relax in the lounge (and plane) and get some sleep.\u00a0I currently have a Costco Anywhere Visa Citibank card (credit limit $16,000) and a Fifth Third Bank Mastercard (credit limit $7,700), both of which I pay in full every month.\u00a0 Credit score is also great - my Transunion/Experian/Equifax is 807/803/807 respectively.\u00a0Due to my plans for future travel, I was looking at getting a travel card to get bonuses on airline miles, and earn credit for free trips faster.\u00a0 The Chase Sapphire brand appealed to me more than Capital One Venture, as Chase gives bonuses for Lyft and train tickets, while Capitol One does neither.\u00a0 I want to visit destinations that are walkable and transit-friendly so that I don't have to rent a car, so bonuses on car rentals are irrelevant to me.\u00a0Based on my situation, would you recommend the Chase Sapphire Preferred, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, or a different card altogether?\u00a0 I am new to the world of travel cards, but the $550 annual fee ($250 effective fee after the $300 hotel credit) for the Sapphire Reserve is no issue for me.\u00a0 Before you decide, here are some pointers:\u00a01.\u00a0 As mentioned before, I typically fly business-class on my (soon to be) yearly long-haul vacation, which gives me lounge access.\u00a0 I would value the Priority Pass as roughly $25-$50, as I would only use it my 1-2 economy flights/year for departures.2.\u00a0 I estimate that my current airfare spend/year would be around $3,500 - $6,000.\u00a0 With the extra 5x on Sapphire Reserve, I would earn at least $300/year (based on a $4,000 airfare spend at $0.015/point at 10x) vs. Sapphire Preferred.3.\u00a0 Lyft is a nice part of my transportation mix, as I use it around 3 times per month (around $50) as a supplement to my public transit pass (which is paid using employer transit benefits).\u00a0 My Mastercard gives me a $5 reward after taking 3 Lyft rides in a month, which automatically resets at the beginning of the next month.\u00a0 With the current rewards system (10x for Sapphire, 5x for Preferred) and $0.015/point, I would get an extra $45 with the Reserve vs. the Preferred.\u00a0 The Lyft Pink membership would be a nice bonus as well.4.\u00a0 One of my relatives has a Chase Sapphire Preferred, and I understand that the referral would earn my relative bonus points.\u00a0 Would the referral also earn me bonus points?\u00a0 If so, would that be valid for the Chase Sapphire Reserve, or just the Chase Sapphire Preferred?5.\u00a0 Should I apply for the card online or at my local Chase Bank branch?\u00a0 Are there extra bonuses for applying in person?6.\u00a0 Finally, my credit reports are currently frozen due to issues with identity theft several years ago.\u00a0 How long does it take to unfreeze them, and when should I apply for the card?\u00a0For me personally, I am leaning toward the Chase Sapphire Preferred due to the recommendations for first-timers to apply for a sub-$100 annual fee credit card, and the credit requirements are lower for the Preferred vs. the Reserve.\u00a0 In addition, the sign-up bonus is the same amount of points for the Preferred and the Reserve.\u00a0 However, with my travel habits and a yearly long-haul business-class round-trip, the Chase Sapphire Reserve might be a better value.\u00a0I look forward to your responses!", "label": "Credit Cards", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Credit-Cards/Chase-Sapphire-Reserve-vs-Chase-Sapphire-Preferred-worth-the/td-p/6699811"}, {"title": "Discover balance posting", "date": "2023-09-29 03:58:00", "content": "Recently with my Discover It card I've noticed that it generally takes the maximum possible time for balances to post when paying at non-online stores.

High interest rates aren't good for credit but they are good for savings. I've been looking at banks that are offering 4.5%-5% for savings accounts and thinking about the money that money could be making. So I think it's time to close those accounts but I don't want to lose a third of my total limits. Not that I need them but... I think if anything maybe I'll close the two cards that won't graduate then hold onto SDFCU to see if it becomes unsecured next year.\u00a0My goal is to get all of my scores to 700.

They sent me over to the verification department. They pulled up my application and said I was declined because I filed for bankruptcy. I understood, thanked the lady and hung up. Then, I though about it and said wait a minute because I filed for bankrupty over 5 years ago.

I see a few upsides and a lot of downsides to my applying right now.\u00a0There are two things that stick out for me with this offer:It's 0% APR for 21 monthsAssuming it qualifies, having the card could keep my US Bank checking free without a minimum direct deposit or balance. (My checking is currently free until next summer IIRC, because it was grandfathered in from Union Bank.)It's not a Cash+ or Altitude Reserve, but having some positive history with a USB card could potentially help me get one or both of those down the road.\u00a0Negatives: I'm currently 8/12 for new cards and 9/12 for new accounts, which I think disqualifies me from any USB cards (I'm also 13/24 for new accounts). Inqs are 12/24 (not including 3 duplicates from car shopping) and 9/12 (not\u00a0including 2 duplicates from car shopping). My FICO8 on Experian is currently 689, reporting 20% utilization.\u00a0\u00a0I'm interested in home shopping in the next year if rates decline enough (probably not for at least the next 6 months). Even if that wasn't the case, I wouldn't be interested in applying for this or any other card in the short term unless I was quite sure I'd be accepted. Because I have a lot of new accounts, US Bank would be one of the last banks I'd consider unless I was very sure I'd be accepted.\u00a0If I was approved for a toy limit like $500, I would not consider that worth the hit to my\u00a0inquiries and the minor hit to my AAoA. (Needless to say, the 0% APR at 21 months would be useless at that limit, there's no cash back or points on the card, and I already have cell phone protection on my Wells Fargo Autograph.) My AAoA is currently 2 years and 8 months with 23 accounts, and my AoOA is 9 years 11 months.\u00a0I appreciate any feedback about this.\u00a0Edit: A possible mitigating factor to my recent new credit spree is my history with US Bank, including my history with Union Bank since May of last year.

I used the card to pay for my Magic Key (Annual Pass) renewal at Disneyland, and that one transaction alone rocketed my utilization from 0% to 55%. I currently have that paid down to about 25-27%.

I had only low use the first month, but the following 2.5 months had far above my average spend for any card on it due to a mix of the 3 month/$2500 intro promo pulling spend from other cards onto it, landing on the months that I have the highest, by far, whole foods spend of the calendar year coincidentally, and a \"spending spree\" that happens to have a lot of Amazon spend while buying supplies for a project, so I definitely had much higher than average spend that landed right in this time on that card, however I never used even half of the CL.

Well, with the holidays coming up, I began to miss some of the perks of holding a Macy's card. Except now (unlike pre-BK)...since I don't carry balances and don't care about high APRs...I started to open my mind to consider reapplying.\u00a0I really did think...for some reason...that I IIB Citi/Macy's, but, as it turns out, I did not. It turns out that I paid them off quite some time before my BK. To be honest, that entire time is a blur as I was treading water financially. Even though not IIB, I do know I was a slow payer on my Macy's Amex during that time with high utilization on the card.\u00a0I really did not want the store card. When I previously got my Macy's Amex, it was only offered by invitation after you had been a store cardholder for some time. I recall waiting a few years for the Amex upgrade. My reading on here led me to believe that you could now apply directly for the Macy's Amex.\u00a0Well...tonight...I got a little bit itchy and decided to gamble and apply. I had not yet decided what I would do if I received just the store card, but I went for the application anyway.\u00a0Shockingly...I was approved for both the Amex and the store card. I selected the Amex, of course. The SL is only $1500, but I know that a little use will help this card grow.

Since my last CLI request for my Blue Cash Everyday (BCE), which was about eight months ago (Jan 2023), I could not make any requests, albeit I don't use the card at all except for the Disney Plus credit (about $7 a month). My credit limit was $12,000. That is until a few minutes ago, I decided to make a CLI request and saw that I could do it. I figured it would not hurt since AMEX CLIs are typically SP. So I requested 3X my limit, which would have been $36,000, and was countered with $24,800. Not bad; this will help with padding, which is what I was looking for anyhow, and the interest rate is too high for a bal transfer at this time, so I will keep it only for Disney Plus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few DPs to share.

Hope this is in the right section.\u00a0 My wife and I own our current home (first home purchase) that we purchased in 2019. To this date, we have been fortunate enough to build some equity with our current home. Purchase price was $290k and current market value has our house for around $380k. Due to life things, we plan on moving and \"upgrading\" within the next 1-2 years and staying within the area. With that said, I want to piece together a rough game plan on what our best approach is since neither my wife or I are financial experts. My wife works a salaried w2 job that is consistent with pay. My career has recently changed for the better and is a base salary + commission w2 job. Some questions I have are as follows:\u00a01. As far as income is concerned, will mortgage lenders look at my FULL yearly w2 income (base salary + commission) ? I hear mixed opinions that it should be a steady 2-year income if I am salary + commission based? How exactly will this be taken into account?\u00a0 2023 is my first year with this pay scale.\u00a0\u00a02. There is a remote possibility that I will either be building an addition or having a space for my parents to move in to our next home. Would it just be my wife and I on the deed of the home? What if my parents want to contribute to the down payment of the home?\u00a03. My wife and I both have \"decent\" credit currently in the low to mid 700's. I plan on bringing mine up as high as I can get it, hoping to be 750+. Is this a good area to be in credit wise?\u00a04. Our current\u00a0DTI\u00a0is no higher than 15%. We have no credit debt, but I am actively paying off school loans with monthly installments and I have a car loan.\u00a05. As far as equity from current home, current principal balance is $265k.

For example, it's amazing to me how much the house will cost when you add the purchase price (current face value), and then you add 30 years of interest payments on top of that, which doubles the price of the house! (roughly) The first time I figured out the math, that number was a shocker. **bleep** near caused me to say: Oh hell no! \ud83d\ude32\u00a0That large number has caused me many sleepless nights since then! \ud83d\ude12\u00a0So I'd like your honest opinion of these two approaches of how to NOT pay double for the house. But in order to do this the way I have it set up in my head, I'll be cash-poor for the next 6-7 years. (straight)\u00a0Note: A little background about me to help everyone put all this in context:\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 55-year-old man, not married, and no kids. And YES, the following situation is primarily because I'm no spring chicken. If I was 25 years old again, I wouldn't be trying to go warp speed! lol \ud83d\ude02\u00a0\u00a0Scenario #1: I simply go for broke (empty all savings accounts and cash in some investments) throwing absolutely everything that I've got into the initial downpayment (equal to 67% of the purchase price of the house) then make Bi-Monthly mortgage payments AND Bi-Monthly EXTRA PRINCIPLE payments equal to one mortgage payment for the next 6 years and 2 months to pay off the house. This would eliminate approximately 75% of the interest if I could pull this off, but it would leave me vulnerable if I needed quick cash for any unforeseen issue for that entire timespan. (health issues, job layoff, etc)\u00a0 But the huge upside is FEWER TOTAL DOLLARS SPENT (nearly 100 thousand dollars in my case!) and epic financial flexibility for the rest of my life once the mortgage is completely paid off.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0Scenario #2: I put down a more modest down payment (33.33%), and I still make the same Bi-Monthly Mortgage and EXTRA PRINCIPLE PAYMENTS (as in Scenario #1) but I end up paying approximately THREE TIMES more in interest payments, and the time span to pay off the house increases to 9.5 - 10 years.\u00a0----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0So, if you were in my shoes guys, what would you do, and WHY? \u270c\u00a0The SUPER AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY (gloves off, don't hold anything back)\u00a0or\u00a0\u00a0The more conservative approach (don't put all your eggs in one basket, don't risk it all just in case something goes wrong)", "label": "Mortgage Loans", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Mortgage-Loans/Getting-ready-to-apply-for-a-mortgage-and-I-need-some-advice/td-p/6705324"}, {"title": "Medical Debt", "date": "2023-07-01 01:23:00", "content": "Does anyone know if settled debt counts as paid in full for medical collections?I am going for USDA 502 Direct loan and collections have to be either paid or on payment plans within the 6 months before you apply.

I thought I was good if I negotiated the best price?===========================================================================================\u00a0This is true, but only if you pay in cash. If you finance or lease a car, the loan/lease brings in a whole new set of parameters which allow the dealer to make more profit off of you. As a savvy consumer, you must understand the process and watch out for any ripoffs.\u00a0I won\u2019t mention too much in detail how to negotiate a good price here as that is already covered by another thread stickied in this forum. Look there for some good tips on negotiating price, but the gist is negotiate with a bunch of dealers via email. The further you are willing to drive, the better your deal. For my last car, I shopped all dealers within a 250 mile radius of my home (which covered 6 states). I saved ~$2k over buying the car from a dealer in my state. It's all about finding that one dealer that needs to make the sale to meet a month end/year end dealer incentive.\u00a0Link to thread on how to negotiate price itself: http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Auto-Loans/How-to-buy-a-car-for-the-first-time-buyer/td-p/1923289\u00a0Any tips beyond the link above on how to negotiate price?===========================================================================================\u00a0Well, I'll mention how I do it for new. Used is similar. But you should find multiple similar models at different dealers and play them off of each other over email.\u00a0I set my target price by going to TrueCar to see what TrueCar says is the price making sure I've selected/otherwise taken into account any possible incentives. Do NOT use your your real name and address/email/phone on the TrueCar site if you want to negotiate on your own. Depending on the car (helps to know what others are buying for), I'll set my price $1k-$2k below TrueCar and see if I can get a dealer to bite...though I have sometimes seen TrueCar be higher by >3k even on a 25k car. If dealers don't bite, move up your target price. Also be sure to tell dealers what incentives you do or don't qualify for and tell them to only include those in the quote.\u00a0I NEVER accept out the door prices. Insist on broken down prices. They should quote you car+destination/freight-incentives you qualify for+doc fees+any options/extras you want+sales tax+tags. Any dealer that refuses to give you exact prices broken down is fishy and should be treated as such.\u00a0Refuse to pay for unwanted options...they tend to back down and remove those (off the price, the options tend to be so worthless, they often don't bother uninstalling them from the car). If they won't remove some options they've added, move on to another dealer.\u00a0Also before going over there, try to insist they send you a buyers order. It's the only way to guarantee they won't play games when you get there and nobody likes driving 200 miles to have a bait & switch done on them. Tell them exactly why you want a buyer's order (you're driving long distances and don't want games + know the buyers order is the only way to not have games played).\u00a0I seriously don\u2019t have this much spare time. I only want to [insert finance or lease here] and would like to skip anything that\u2019s not about [insert financing or leasing here]===========================================================================================\u00a0This guide is going to deal with both in two separate sections. You\u2019ll gain the most insights if you read both. But I understand if you don\u2019t want to. Financing will be covered by the rest of this and the next two posts. Leasing will be covered by the posts after these three. Just skip to the second part (the fourth post in this thread) if you don\u2019t want to read about financing a purchase.Part I: Financing\u00a0What are the biggest things I need to watch out for when I\u2019m financing?===========================================================================================\u00a0When financing, the process is pretty much the same for both new and used cars (as well as pitfalls). Mainly you want to watch out for the loan approval process, dealer participation, LTV, term of loan, and dealer extras.", "label": "Auto Loans", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Auto-Loans/Guide-to-Financing-Leasing-and-Refinancing-a-Car/td-p/2898720"}, {"title": "Do I qualify for an auto loan? Info that is needed.", "date": "2013-07-07 03:27:00", "content": "One of the most FAQ on the fico forums is, \"Do I qualify for an auto loan?\" When asking about approval chances, it would be helpful to include the information below. Some of the information may be sensitive, and it is up to you as to which information and how much details you wish to provide.\u00a0\u00a0Credit\u00a0This is one of the biggest factors when applying for any type of credit. What does your credit scores look like. What does your credit report look like. Do you have any negative marks like charge offs, collections, judgements. When were the negatives. What is your average\u00a0age of accounts\u00a0(AAoA).\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any auto loan history on your reports? Or is this your first time financing a car? How was the payment history on your auto loan tradeline? Many lenders may use 'auto-enhanced' fico scores which takes any previous loan history as a bigger factor. An auto enhanced FICO is often higher than your regular FICO if you have previous auto loan history with a flawless payment history. Some lenders who do a manual review on credit reports will also pay special attention to auto loan tradelines.\u00a0\u00a0Include any other relevant credit information you feel might be helpful.\u00a0Income & EmploymentWhat is your current income. How long have you been at your current employer (more or less than 2 years).\u00a0\u00a0Debt-to-Income (DTI)Calculate your monthly debt minimum required payments versus your income. Remember to include items like child support payments, alimony, and rent. Things like ultility bills and insurances are not included in this.\u00a0\u00a0Collateral (the car you are wanting to purchase)Is the vehicle new or used. What is the year of the vehicle. How many miles are on the vehicle. Lenders usually have collateral restrictions for example some banks will only finance vehicles no older than 7 years old and/or no more than 100,000 miles. If you know the value of your car, it would be helpful in figuring out the Loan-to-Value (LTV).\u00a0\u00a0Loan amount & down payment\u00a0This helps determine the LTV. How much do you want to borrow. Are you planning to give a down payment or trade-in a car as down payment. If the car you are purchasing is $20,000 and you want a loan for $22,000 to pay for TT&L then your LTV would be calculated as 22,000 / 20,000 = 1.1 or 110% LTV. Lenders usually have a maximum threshold LTV before the loan application is automatically declined. Sometimes this is a good question to ask a lender before applying.\u00a0Transaction type & loan terms\u00a0Purchase or refinance. How many months are you looking to finance your vehicle. This isn't a big factor in getting approved, although most lenders usually increase interest rates if you finance more than 60 months.\u00a0\u00a0Co-borrower / co-signerAre you planning to use a co-applicant. Do you have one available.\u00a0\u00a0OtherEverybody's situation is different. Provide any other information you think would be relevant. Remember the more information you provide, the more accurate assessment can be made.

I want to share my experience with this forum because I hope it will help others find the best deal on a car and the best deal on the interest rate on a loan. Also because I've learned so much from myfico that I also want to contribute to it. I'm not an expert car buyer, so take this advice for what its worth. It will be mostly about buying a new car, and shopping for an auto loan. I will include a short section on buying used cars and trading in your current vehicle, although I have virtually no experience in this. This may turn out to be a lengthy read, but it will help if you just have no idea on where to start.\u00a0\u00a0*tldr = too long, didnt read (know this acronym)\u00a0How much can you afford?\u00a0Well first step is the create your budget.\u00a0If you don't have a monthly budget, a good time to create one is when you're considering the purchase of a car. Begin by making a list of all your monthly bills and their associated payments, such as utilities, credit-card payments, rent or mortgage payment and insurance. Also track how much you spend on things like food and gas for a week to determine what these items are truly costing you.\u00a0The general rule of thumb is to spend no more than 20% of your net income towards a car payment. So if you bring home $2000 after taxes multiplied by 20% is $400.\u00a0So if you're budget calculations doesn't allow for 20% towards your brand new dream car, then you should reconsider buying a new car. Things you could consider are putting off the purchase of your new car until your financial situation improves, buying a cheaper car or even used.\u00a0\u00a0Now you have to figure out what loan terms you have to be approved for to stay within your recommended 20% net income. You can do this by using an auto loan calculator. Play with the loan terms until you figure out the loan amount, months to finance, and interest rate you need to be approved for. Know that loan interest rates generally go up if you finance over 60 months.\u00a0Don't let the loan amount you figured to dictate what you will be willing to pay for the car when you negotiate. You may very well be able to negotiate a lower price than what you figured.\u00a0Here's the link to Chase's auto loan calculator. I used it and it was only off by $1.\u00a0https://wwwq3.chase.com/auto-loans/payment-calculator\u00a0Don't forget about your DTI:If you are considering the purchase of a home in the foreseeable future, you might want to abide by the mortgage-industry standard for debt-to-income ratio. Mortgage lenders typically want to see that your total monthly debt expenditure, not including housing costs, does not exceed 36 percent of your gross monthly income. If purchasing a new car will push you past this threshold, consider postponing a vehicle purchase until after you've bought a home. If you already own a home, you can still use this standard as a guide when buying a new car.\u00a0\u00a0Yes there's a DTI explanation and calculator, here you go:http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/ratio-debt-calculator.aspx\u00a0So, I decided to internet shop for my car:I emailed 5 local Honda dealerships asking for a price quote on the same model and trim. Most of them replied within 15 minutes, some requested me call. I didn't call, and instead replied, \"I'm requesting online quotes because I don't have time to call around. Please send me a quote.\" Some eventually sent me quote, one didn't so I simply didn't deal with them. I then replied to all the dealership except for the one that offered me the best quote. \"I appreciate your quote, but this dealership offered me a better quote at $25,000. If you are able to come down, please let me know.\" I repeated this until it was down to 2 dealerships bidding for my business. Of couse dealerships hate it, but I'm the customer so I have every right. Finally the last dealership gave up and said, \"if they want to lose that much money we cannot lose that much, they can have the deal.\" I found my best quote. Remember to always ask for a breakdown of the driveout quote that itemizes the TT&L (it shows everything you're paying for and makes comparing quotes easier).\u00a0Why I choose to do internet shopping? I did my research and found this article:\u00a0Internet vs Traditional Car Buying:http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/part-one-internet-vs-traditional-car-buying.htmltldr:\u00a0No face to face sales pressure. No spur of the moment decisions spurred by the new car smell.\u00a0Internet salesmen make less commission and focus more on selling volume. Traditional car salesmen depend on a higher commission for their living so they need to pad prices. Internet salesmen get to the bottom line price faster. Saves money and me time from visiting dealership to dealership.\u00a0Auto Loan Shopping:As I was nearing the best quote on my car, I started shopping for a loan. I first applied to my primary bank (Chase), then my secondary bank (Capital One), and then to like 6 different credit unions. After I got a few approvals, and awaiting others, I went to visit the dealership to apply with Honda financing. The best rate I had was from a credit union at 4.89% with zero down and 650 fico score, amount financed was $25,700. I told the finance manager at Honda I was approved for \"around 4.5%\", cause technically I was around there lol. They offered me 3.8% and with my credit score I was very excited about that (but didnt show excitement, don't show excitement to them). BUT I didn't accept and instead replied, \"I'm still waiting on a few credit unions to give me their rate.\" As I waited, none of the remaining CUs could be this rate. But the original one that approved me for 4.89% was calling to follow up, I told them my offer from Honda, and they said, \"let me inform my underwriter and see what we can do to beat that rate\". I didn't know CUs would do rate match. They called me back and offered me 3.75% but said I could reduce this rate by another .40% by starting a relationship and autopay. A rate of 3.35% total and at only 650 FICO. Of course I gave Honda one more opportunity to beat this rate, but they couldn't. In fact they attempted to say well that was a one day offer at that rate, and gave me a worse rate. I was a little peeved, but was still okay because I simply went with the Credit Union and started a whole relationship with them: checking, savings, auto loan, and even a credit card at $2500 limit (using the same hard pull on the auto loan to give me credit card).\u00a0tldr: Apply at atleast 5+ financial institutions with most being CUs (they offer best rates). Apply at dealership financing last (they love to beat rates). Yes its a lot of Inquires on your credit report, but if you do it all within a short period it counts as 1 inquiry for scoring purposes. How do I know? Here's the link to myfico explaining:http://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/CreditInquiries.aspx\u00a0**Please note: If you're not sure if you will be approved for a loan, shop for a loan first. It would be a waste of time for you to negotiate car prices if you are unable to get financing. Most loans are good for atleast 30 days after approval.\u00a0What to expect in the finance office:They'll try to keep you excited about the car you just bought and in a \"yes mode\" as they continue to sell you lots of different warranties, GAP insurance and other packaged products. Know what you're buying and if you really need it. I declined on all products, because I felt like I didn't need any. Remember if you don't understand, dont sign it!! \u00a0Don't be afraid to tell the finance manager that you're not ready to sign anything. And don't take the finance manager's answer, they are so vague and wont tell you what you actually need to know. If you do want a product, remember that price is negotiable. Also remember CUs may offer same products such as GAP. Be aware of shady practices. Main thing to remember, the dealership interest rate is also negotiable and that the finance manager will get commission for setting up the loan.Here is the article on this:http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/confessions-of-an-auto-finance-manager.html\u00a0tldr: 10 Things Not To Do in F&I (Don't skip this section)\u00a0Here is the Top 10 list that should get you in and out of the F&I room unscathed.\u00a0Don't agree to be a monthly payment buyer. If you do, you'll quickly lose control of negotiations as they pack payments and hide the real cost of the car.Don't buy a car without first checking pricing guides such as Edmunds.com's TMV. Print out this information and take it with you to the dealership.Don't buy the extended warranty. The bumper-to-bumper warranty will last for at least three years/36,000 miles. The powertrain warranty will then cover all the things that make the car go down the road, often for up to 75,000 miles.Don't buy the extended warranty (if you really want it) for the first price they offer. Mark-up is about 100 percent, so there is plenty of room for negotiating.Don't enter the F&I room unless you have independent financing or you have recently checked your credit report and investigated what your bank or credit union will offer for a rate. Otherwise, how will you know what interest rate you deserve?Don't buy paint protection (it's just a glorified wax job) or fabric protection or VIN etching or LoJack (unless you have an irreplaceable collector's car). These are high-profit items for the dealership and can always be purchased somewhere else if you decide you really want them.Don't pass up gap insurance if you're leasing (unless it's already in the contract).Don't forget to run your monthly payment numbers using an auto loan calculator\u00a0get a rough idea of what your car payment will be.Don't believe that the F&I guy is really your friend, even though he acts like it.Don't believe the F&I guy if he tells you that you have to buy the extended warranty to qualify for low or no-interest financing. I've used this line a few times before. And it's not true.If you have a car to trade in:\u00a0I didn't trade in a car, so I couldn't post a personal experience about it. But I included a link to an article I found that may be helpful.http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/navigating-the-trade-in-process.htmltldr: Find out what your car is worth, dont get ripped off on your trade. Negotiate the trade-in before talking anything about new car price. Consider selling \u00a0to private party.\u00a0Buying used cars:\u00a0\u00a0I didn't buy a used car either, but after reasearch here is some great information.\u00a0\u00a0As a rule of thumb, \"every $10,000 has a $2,000 mark up included.\" There is also a processing fee of $300-600 depending on the dealer. The average markup rate is 26%, but can be as high as 45% on a used car. Know the real value of what your car may be worth. Expect the dealer to make a little mark up, otherwise they wouldn't be in business. But still negotiate like a mad man. Estimate the car value:http://www.kbb.com/used-cars/\u00a0 \u00a0*Not sure how accurate kbb is.\u00a0Rule #1: Don't trust used car salesmenRule #2:\u00a0NEVER TRUST A CARFAX REPORT\u00a0Short video on abc news about carfax:\u00a0http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/check-carfax-18743237\u00a0tldr: Know that there is 26-45% markup on all used vehicles. Know what the actual worth of the car you're thinking about buying. Don't trust a carfax report even when buying from a 'reputable' dealer. Always get the car inspected by an independant mechanic regardless of where or who you are purchasing from.\u00a0\u00a0Conclusion:\u00a0The best thing you can do when buying a car is\u00a0Do Your Research.\u00a0That's exactly what I've done and compiled it here for you and the myfico members. If you are reading this article, then I applaud you for already doing some research. But if you don't know or unsure about anything, google is your best friend. Don't forget that the myfico community is a great place to ask questions.I hope this helps at least one person, as it would make the time spent to write this post worth it. If you have questions, feel free to PM me. But I ask that you also post it here, as the question may help others wanting to know the same.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "label": "Auto Loans", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Auto-Loans/How-to-buy-a-car-for-the-first-time-buyer/td-p/1923289"}, {"title": "FICO Auto-Enhanced Scores", "date": "2008-05-02 07:33:00", "content": "What is an Auto Enhanced score and how do I leverage it?Most people do not realize there is a difference between your normal FICO score, and the score you are graded on when you apply for auto credit. Your normal credit score is simply referred to as \"Classic FICO Score (also referred to as your BEACON score)\". The auto score is usually referred to as your \"FICO Auto Industry Option\". This score it not available for you to purchase and only dealers\\finance companies are able to pull it. Here are the major differences between Auto and Classic scores:-The major difference between FICO scores and FICO auto scores is that the auto scores rate you more on how you've managed your previous auto credit. Most car lenders primarily care about how you\u2019ve paid your auto loans. The auto score gives them this information.-Have you made late payments on a current or previous auto loan or lease?-Have you ever settled an auto loan or lease for less than you owed?-Have you had a car repossessed?-Have you had an auto account sent to collections?-Did you include your car loan or lease in your bankruptcy?How some car dealers \"play the spread\" to get you to pay more (and increase their commissions)It's possible that a car dealer has the ability to pull your traditional FICO scores AND your FICO auto scores. That means they'll have six scores on you. It's a guarantee that some of those scores are going to be higher than the others. So which ones will they use when trying to get you financed?It depends.Are you familiar with the term \"spread\"? It's how car dealers make money when they finance you. If they can quote you a higher interest rate than you deserve\u2014then they stand to make a nice chunk of change from the bank that finances you.The only way to make a killer \"spread\" is to make you think that you have lower scores.How to use your FICO scores to your advantage when buying a car?Fortunately, you don't have to fall for their dirty tricks. Now that you know all about FICO Auto Industry Option scores, you can protect yourself. Here's what I suggest...When you first walk into the finance director's office, don't tell him what your FICO scores are. Wait until he reviews the scores himself. Then ask him what your scores are. If the scores he reviewed are higher than the ones you have, don't say anything and just go by his scores. However, if your scores are higher, then pull them out and show him. If he has a choice in the type of scores he can use, there's a possibility that he'll be able to use your highest score. And, it will let him know that he doesn't have a fool sitting in front of him. He can't take advantage of you!How do you find out what your FICO Auto Industry Option scores are before you walk into a car dealership?The following Auto Enhanded FICO scores are provided here at myFICO when your purchase your credit report:\u00a0Experian:FICO\u00ae Auto Score 8FICO\u00ae Auto Score 2FICO\u00ae Auto Score 9\u00a0Equifax:FICO\u00ae Auto Score 8FICO\u00ae Auto Score 5FICO\u00ae Auto Score 9\u00a0TransUnion:FICO\u00ae Auto Score 8FICO\u00ae Auto Score 4FICO\u00ae auto Score 9\u00a0So how can you use this information to help you get your next new car financed at the best interest rate?First, get your three FICO scores\u00a0from myfico.com. Remember, myfico.com is the ONLY place you can get\u00a0all three of your FICO\u00a0scores as well as their auto-enhanced counterparts. The three major buraeus sell credit scores. There are commonly referred to as FAKO scores and are worthless to you. Some credit bureaus will sell a standard FICO score, but it will not include the auto-enhanced version. If you handled your previous auto credit well\u2014your FICO Auto Industry Option scores will be higher than your traditional FICO scores. So expect more from the lender. You can also ask the lender to show you their tier levels. Tiers are basically charts lenders use that have different interest rates based on your scores. You want to see which tier your fall in.If they won't show you...at least have them break it down verbally for you. (Personally, I like to see it with my own eyes, as I never believe a word that comes out of most car dealers' mouths.)If you've handled your auto credit poorly...then you should simply try to find an auto lender that uses just the traditional FICO credit scores. When you find a lender that uses a traditional FICO credit score, you'll have your best chance to get the lowest interest rate.Start by calling dealerships and ask the finance person the following:-What credit reporting agency do your lenders use?-Do your lenders use FICO Auto Industry Option scores (or you can say, \u201cFICO auto enhanced scores\u201d) or regular FICO credit scores?-What\u2019s the minimum score that I need to get approved through your captive lender?-What\u2019s the minimum score that I need to get approved at the best rate by your captive lender?-How does a discharged bankruptcy (or other major negative item) affect your loan decision?-When was the last time you got someone with a [mention whatever concerns you about your credit reports here] on their credit reports approved? Tell me about that deal.-What factors other than my scores go into your decision-making process?-Can you dictate which score or which credit reporting agency the lenders you work with use to make a loan decision?\u00a0Message Edited by fused on 06-08-2009 07:15 AM", "label": "Auto Loans", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Auto-Loans/FICO-Auto-Enhanced-Scores/td-p/228198"}, {"title": "Pay off auto loan before applying for a new loan?", "date": "2023-09-27 06:07:00", "content": "Hi everyone,\u00a0wanted to get a little advice on timing for my scenario.\u00a0I have two vehicles with two loans.\u00a0I sold one vehicle today and want to use some of the equity to pay off the second loan as well.\u00a0in November/December timeframe I will be getting a new auto loan for a new vehicle that should be arriving which I previously custom ordered.im trying to decide, from a point perspective, if it would actually hurt my scores to have both auto loans paid off, or if I should wait to pay off the last auto loan after I get my new vehicle in a few months.\u00a0there is only about 10 months remaining on my current loan and figured I'd save a few bucks on interest even though it's fairly low at 3%.

Please keep this in mind. On day one, from the time you sign your loan papers, the interest accrues and is compounded on a daily basis. So, by the time you finally make your first payment, all the interest adds up. This sum amount will be higher than the original amount that you signed for.\u00a0\u00a0Here is how to figure\u00a0out the daily interest that you will be charged.\u00a0You just bought a truck or SUV for $ 40,000 with an interest rate of 7.5% (example). Your first payment is not due for 90 days. Take $ 40,000 and times that by .0750% (interest). This would equal an annual interest fee of $ 3,000. Take that $ 3K & divide by 365 (how many days there are in a year) which would equal $ 8.22 of interest per day charged before any principle payment is considered. Then take $ 8.22 of interest per day & times that by 30 (number of average days in a month. The total of interest payments without principle being applied will be $ 246.60 which is more than the original amount. Then you recompute\u00a0the new interest after that. Always go off of what the new balance is. In other words, the daily interest will just keep increasing if you do not immediately start making payments. I am aware that some may not be able to do this because of different financial situations. I wanted to share this because on the last two auto loans with the credit union, I made the first payment on the same day that I signed the agreement. Then I made additional payments to keep the interest under control 2 to 4 times per month.\u00a0", "label": "Auto Loans", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Auto-Loans/No-payments-for-up-to-three-months/td-p/6711708"}, {"title": "Increasing my FICO Auto Score 8", "date": "2023-09-12 07:47:00", "content": "\u00a0Hello, I am reaching out in hopes for more understanding and tips on what I can do to increase my Auto Score 8.

You awesome myFICO contributors have always come through for me by sharing valuable experience, knowledge and advice....soooo, i'm coming back with a new question that I am hoping to obtain advice/opinions on. I am currently in a position to pay off my auto loan 7 months early. The loan was originally approved for 75 months at 9.60% interest (I was in a credit rebuilding stage at the time) and, as of today, has a pay-off amount of $4,500 (15.9% UTIL). I have 1 other debt consolidation installment loan with SOFI, opened in February 2022 for 48 months and 14% interest. Therefore, if I pay off the auto loan, I will still have another installment loan. Here's my question......if I go ahead and pay of the auto loan early, should I expect a big hit to my credit score? All 3 of my scores are currently sitting at 678 - 689. If my scores take a significant hit, how long does it take for the bounce-back to happen?....or does it even happen?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "label": "Auto Loans", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Auto-Loans/Pros-vs-Cons-of-Paying-Off-Auto-Loan-7-Months-Early/td-p/6682181"}, {"title": "Welcome to our new Student Loans board!", "date": "2008-05-26 09:42:00", "content": "Welcome to our new Student Loans board!\u00a0This board is not only for students and prospective college students but also for parents, student loan lenders, college financial office\u00a0reps,\u00a0and other folks interested in and with the knowledge of the rapidly changing world of student lending.\u00a0Thanks for contributing to the FICO Forums and tell your friends!\u00a0- Barry", "label": "Student Loans", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Student-Loans/Welcome-to-our-new-Student-Loans-board/td-p/247642"}, {"title": "University Accounting Services (UAS) not following CFR rules for servicing perkins loan", "date": "2023-09-24 07:48:00", "content": "In late February 2023 an automatic payment was not made due to insufficent funds.

UAS called me in June (found out in September 2023 after getting calls from collection agency) but never left a message I was told during a Sept. 1, 2023 conversation asking why UAS did not reach out to me about the problem of receiving payments. The manager told me that sometimes it is against policy to leave messages about sensitive information about a loan. This explanation flies in the face of Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) requirements. In the CFR Section 643.43 (f) If the borrower does not respond to the final demand letter within 30 days from the date it was sent, the institution shall attempt to contact the borrower by telephone before beginning collection procedures.

Select \"Spark Cash for Business\" accounts created on or after October 2020 do not report to personal CRA's.

I finally took the time considering all of the interest in the forums about establishing and building business credit. As always, I am not a lawyer and YMMV. Establish the Business1. NAME YOUR COMPANY - The first step in this process is to select a company name. Be sure you pick one that has not been selected by another company in your state, You can check with you Secretary of State and once that is done you can move onto the next step.2. INCORPORATE YOUR COMPANY - Now that you have selected your business name, you are going to need to establish your corporation with the state of your choosing. To do this, you can go to \"Free Registered Agent\". which is owned by InCorp Services. They will give you registered agent services free for the first year. They also only charge a nominal fee plus your states filing fees to incorporate your business.3. OBTAIN AN EIN - Once you have incorporated your business you will need to obtain a Federal Employer Identification Number. You can file form SS-4 online at the Internal Revenue Service website.http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,00.htmlOnce you have completed this form you will obtain your EIN in a matter of seconds. Be sure to print it out and write it down because they do not send you an email confirmation. This is the number that you will need in order to apply for credit under your business name without a personal guarantee.4. ESTABLISH A LOCATION - So now you have your EIN and are incorporated. Your business needs to have a physical location that is not your home address. The UPS store will not work because most creditors have them flagged. An alternative is to get a virtual office in your home town. Most of these will supply you with a lease agreement (sometimes needed to get credit), license hanging services, your name on a wall plaque at the location, and mail forwarding services. You should be able to find these services bundled for about $100 per month. In addition, some of these places will even allow you small usage of the buildings conference room and offices for an additional fee. This is great if you just need a completely quiet place to work for a few hours or if you need to sign a contract or conduct a meeting.5. ESTABLISH PHONE SERVICE - Now that you have a physical location for your business, you will need to establish a utility bill using your newly received EIN and business address. There are many choices for this step of the process.a) Contact your local telephone companies business sales department and request what they call a Remote Call Forwarding Number. This is a number that the phone company manages at their and is forwarded to a number of your choosing. They will usually charge a setup fee and $10 to $15 per month. Make sure you give them\u00a0the address of the office that you set up and the EIN number. Also make sure that they will list you in the 411 directory under your address, not theirs.b) Another method is to get an 800 number and have it forwarded to a number of your choosing. You can then utilize \"List Yourself\" to add yourself to your local 411. However, this is not recommended because there is still no free way (that I know of) to list yourself in the national 411 directories.c) For those of you that need a true business line, you can subscribe to the Vonage SmallBusiness Premium service (or any other small business VOIP service) and for $49.99 per month and they will list your business in both your local and national 411 directories.6. ESTABLISH A CHECKING ACCOUNT - Once you have all of that in order, you can now open your corporate checking account. Many banks only require $100 to open the account, 2 forms of identification, and your Articles of Incorporation. 7. OBTAIN A D-U-N-S NUMBER - Now you need to go to Dun & Bradstreet and obtain a D-U-N-SNumber. In the two more years of buidling business credit I have noted one ever constant factor.... Dun & Bradstreet is the leading cause of headaches for businesses trying to build a credit file.  New business owners are especially prone to the sales pitches thrown by commission hungry DUNS sales reps. Just about every new business owner tends to ask a question about DUNS or ends up complaining about them. The front lines of D&B are covered by the DUNS sales representatives. More often than not if you are trying to get a DUNS number from them it starts the vicious cycle of how worthless simply having the number will be and how you \"need\" to buy CreditBuilder or another product to have a full rated file. The plain and simple fact is, you do NOT need to buy anything from DUNS to end up with a fully rated file! DUNS sales reps will of course try and tell you otherwise in hopes of making you pay. Unlike personal credit CRAs, DUNS is not governed by the FCRA. They are a loose canon existing within a realm of pure gray area when it comes to regulation. Simply put, they can screw you and get away with it if your not careful.First thing that has often been misunderstood is that you need to get a DUNS number in order to have a file. Or that you need to contact DUNS to open a file or get a number. This is misinformation.A DUNS number can and is automatically created by one of the following: a) When your first NET30 account reports the tradeline the DUNS system will automatically create your number and file. b) If you are incorporated, the Secretary of State in your state will often automatically report your corporation's existence as it reports quarterly or semi-annually to DUNS.I am unsure if every states SOS office in fact does this. Many I know do. The best bet for auto creation is to simply open some starter NET30 Internet based office suppliers (see below). Be sure and use the account and then promptly pay the invoice you get. Most of these places will open you a NET30 terms account with as little as a 411 phone listing for your company. There are enough of these vendors out there to use if one or the other gives you grief insisting they need to see a credit file. Some of these vendors may ask you to place an initial prepaid order. No biggie. Get it out of the way and move on to having a NET30 terms account. Many will open you one from the start no questions asked.If you need a DUNS number immediately it can often be obtained from the government contracts site:http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform/pages/CCRSearch.jspThough it's just as easy to let it auto create. The thing you MUST be is PATIENT! It's not going to all happen in a day or even a week. If you miss out on the vendors reporting cycle it may take a number of weeks for the NET30 to report. But given your alternative of calling the main DUNS numbers and getting grief from the commission hungry reps and possibly getting your file flagged by a rep who is going to try to hamstring you or otherwise extort services from you, it would be wise to just let it auto create.Again, you\u00a0DO NOT\u00a0need to call DUNS to get a number or file. Just like Experian business files, DUNS will auto create with the SOS or first tradeline data.When you do a search on DUNS for your business and it finally shows up, then you want to get eupdate access. In order to access your eupdate report you need two things, your DUNS number and an eupdate password. The easiest way to accomplish this is to click your business when it shows up in a search. It will give you several different type reports you can buy on the company. Select the cheap $9.99 basic report. All you want is the DUNS number here. Buying more expensive reports will likely not yield any other info given how new your company is. Don't waste your money. Spend the $9.99. Buy the report. You will then get to see your DUNS number.Ok, go to eupdate....https://eupdate.dnb.com/ (keep in mind that the eupdate site is frequently down for whatever reason)Bookmark this page. But do not do anything yet cause chances are if you fill out the sign up info at this point your just gonna get an error page saying your entered info doesn't match what's on file. The real problem actually is that your report doesn't have all the info on file for the eupdate system to match against.Instead, call 1-866-834-4699. This is the entity department. Tell them your DUNS number and that you are having an issue getting your eupdate password. They will either verify company info with you right then and there or they will take your company and phone number and put you on the callback list for their department. If they tell you the rep will call you, they will and be sure to answer the phone when you see them calling (this department is not the sales department) they will run down the company info asking about biz stats and owners, etc. They will probably ask for financials to round out your report. All this really means is they want a copy of a balance sheet. If you don't do them typically, go on Google and find a balance sheet template and fill it out. They will give you a fax number to send it to.After they take your info you need to let the new info register into their system. This may take a day or two. At this point if they haven't already emailed you an eupdate password, the info that will allow the system to send you one should now be on their system and you can go up to the aforementioned eupdate link and sign up. They should simply send you one within a day or two after taking all your info. When you talk to the rep at the above number, or the one that calls you back, be sure to get their direct number and extension as to follow up should they put an error in your file like an incorrectly spelled name or phone number. When you get your eupdate password log in. Do not choose the edit profile option. Just choose the one that lets you see the report. Any time you hit the edit button, DUNS keeps a running count and if you go into edit mode too much they will flag your file. You can get updates done easier when dealing with this department anyway. Most things you enter into eupdate will get you a verification call from DUNS anyway, so just don't screw with the edit section. Also don't look at your eupdate every day. Updates are typically only done once a week and visible on Sundays anyway. So look on Sunday.Other helpful hints.... - Do NOT go on app sprees. Inquiries set off alarms with DUNS and gets your file sent to an early fraud department which often results in your file being frozen with all reporting data and ratings removed.- There is NO reason to call the main DUNS numbers or even deal with the sales team. There is not even any good reason to go get your DUNS number as to simply letting it auto create. I know some folks need it for Government bidding, but plan it out a little ahead of time and get the number by auto creation and you will have taken a serious step at avoiding the front line sales people that is the main reason for most peoples complaints. - There are departments within DUNS who are not on commission and will never try to sell you a thing. You just need to go in the back door.Establishing your Business Credit1. ESTABLISH YOUR INITIAL ACCOUNTS - Once you have everything that is required to apply for credit you can go about establishing your initial accounts, Before you go applying everywhere think again. This is a slow process and your business credit might be flagged or even blocked if you apply to too many places at once, I recommend that you start out with 6 to 8 companies on NET30 terms. Below is a list of companies that offer NET30 Terms. Purchase a small initial order from each of these companies that approved you for NET30. Pay your invoice off well before its due date as that is how the D&B Paydex Score is calculated.- Fedex\\Kinkos- Quill- ULine- Nebs- Reliable- Office Depot- Gemplers- Interstate Battery2. WHAT IS A PAYDEX SCORE - A Paydex score is what D&B uses to tell potential creditors about your payment history and worthiness. It scales from a range from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best possible score. You are going to want to keep your Paydex score at or above 80. Paydex score are broken down as follows:100 - Pays before invoice is generated90 - Pays during discount period80 - Pays when invoice is due70 - Pays 15 days beyond terms60 - Pays 22 days beyond terms50 - Pays 30 days beyond terms40 - Pays 60 days bevond terms20 - Pays 90 days beyond termsUN - Unavailable3. WAIT FOR PAYDEX SCORE - In order to receive a Paydex score, you will need to have five tradelines reporting to D&B. Once you have five reporting you will be assigned your Paydex score. Now that you have this Paydex score you can move on to establishing revolving accounts, you can move on to Building Your Business Credit.4. WHILE YOU WAIT -\u00a0 While you are waiting for your Paydex score to come through, you should also be able to open a revolving charge account at Staples without having your Paydex score. Most people get approved for $750 right off the bat. You will need to fax them in a copy of your phone bill however or at the minimum have your company listed in the 411.5. GETTING A CELL PHONE - If you need cellular service for your business you should use youbusiness name and EIN to obtain a cellular phone, Most carriers will approve you for service without any deposits.Building Your Business Credit1. ESTABLISH MORE TRADE LINES - Now that you have your Paydex score you are going to want to begin applying to companies for revolving credit accounts. Remember, you DO NOT want to go on application sprees. You should start by applying to just a couple of companies.2. CONTINUE YOUR BUILDING - Always wait a few weeks in between applying for more trade lines, and only do one or two at a time. Again it is important to stress that you should NEVER go on application sprees. This affects your business credit just as bad as if you were to do it with your personal credit.3. REVOLVING CREDIT COMPANIES - Here is a list of companies that offer credit on revolving terms. Please remember that if they ask you for a personal guarantee to tell them you do not want to give it. Most times the company will just process the application without it.- Staples- Frys- Walmart- Lowes- Home Depot- Citi PP- Dell4. GAS CARDS - Here is a list of gas cards that you can get without a personal guarantee as well. These will come in handy when you are on the road for business.- Conoco 76- Shell- Exxon/Mobile- Chevron- SunocoGood luck!- Tuscani", "label": "Business Credit", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Business-Credit/Business-Credit-101/td-p/108894"}, {"title": "About the Business Credit forum....", "date": "2009-03-22 10:58:00", "content": "Welcome to our new Business Credit forum!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0How does business credit differ from personal credit?What are the best business cards to get?

The 0% APR promotion on my AMEX BBC expires on 10/25 and I have almost $17,000 to pay off. I have some cash to put forward to it and the possibility of BT onto my Elan Business Cash Preferred where I have some cap room.\u00a0Overall though I'd recommend Elan's business cards as they pump out regular 0% APR balance transfer offers unlike other 0% APR business issuers like Chase or AMEX where the 0% APR is a one time thing.\tOfficial travel point totals as of 7/29/23 (1,264,664 Total Points)Chase Ultimate Rewards 500,112 | IHG One Rewards 184,815 | Hilton Honors 143,801 | AMEX Membership Rewards 101,672 | World of Hyatt 90,413 | Marriott Bonvoy 84,039 | Citi Thank You 62,555 | Southwest Rapid Rewards 27,709 | United MileagePlus 13,316 | British Airways Avios 12,333 | Jet Blue TrueBlue 11,661 | NASA Platinum Rewards 1,883 | AA Advantage 1,744 | Navy Federal Rewards 792 | Delta Sky Miles 175 | Virgin Atlantic Virgin Points 100 | Discover CB 18,459 ($184.59)| Lowes Business Rewards 6,780 ($67.80) | Amazon Rewards 2,305 ($23.05)", "label": "Business Credit", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Business-Credit/Elan-Business-Card-Application/td-p/6711444"}, {"title": "Chase Business Unlimited In Branch", "date": "2023-09-07 12:22:00", "content": "About to apply for my 2nd Business Unlimited card in August and after some fustrations with the internet I decided to try the in branch thing back 2 weeks ago.

He thought I said I wanted a 30,000 limit and I said 10,000 would be enough for me. Once I returned home he sent me an email and I had to sign the application. I adjusted a few things such as lowered my monthly spend for the credit card to make it more realistic. After submitting I received the 30 day message.\u00a0Two weeks later I called Chase. What was fustrating is that I didn't receive an application reference number as I had in the past. But wasn't asked that by the Chase CSR either. They just said wait 30 days. Well today I got that call from Chase wanting to verify that I wanted the card and was told they were going to endorse the application. I asked when I should receive notice and they said by email or in the mail within a week or two.\u00a0Naturally out of my own curiosity I check into my Chase account and there it was a new Business Ink Unlimited sitting there with a balance of 10,000. Last time out with this same businesss I only got 3,000 limit though requesting more online but it seems doing it in branch made a difference for me relative to my limit. It could be i was due for an auto CLI or something anyways and that reflected how much credit chase was willing to give me.\u00a0Still have to wait a couple of weeks for the actual card and the clock on my SUB starts ticking as of 9/7.

Not sure if this should be posted here or in approvals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Started rebuilding about 18 months ago. Illness followed by death of my husband caused a financial meltdown almost 6 years ago. I am retired, so still stuck with low income and inability to do much to repair the damage. I still have 4 COs and a collection that are holding my scores down. With EE, they will begin to fall off in about a year. I don't have any baddies on Chex or anything similar. No lates or other baddies since 2018. Due to low income, about all I can do is establish new trade lines and wait.\u00a0\u00a0My rebuild started in Feb 2022 when Ollo/Ally sent me a preapproval in the mail. I was thrilled to get ANY preapproval and figured why not, scores are so low it can't hurt (I had 0 inquiries anyway). I was ecstatic when I was approved for a $1k SL. They pulled Experian. Carried low/no balance for 6 months and they granted an auto-CLI to $2300 in September a year ago. They don't have a luv button, so no idea when another CLI is available. Since they were acquired by Ally, rewards on this card are decent for a rebuilder card, but APR is still very high. I believe it is still invitation only, but Ally has other cards.\u00a0\u00a0In June 2022 I joined NFCU. The Ollo card was still very new and I intended to garden, but the CSR who opened my acct strongly urged me to apply. It was declined, and although I had a decent internal score as a new customer, they did not make a counter-offer for the nRewards secured card.\u00a0\u00a0Scores were slowly climbing, but then I paid off my auto loan in Sept 2022. Now I had no open installment loans (house is also paid off), so scores dropped ~30 pts across the board. I was back where I started. Wow, was that ever discouraging!\u00a0\u00a0I received a few Mission Lane pre-approvals in the mail and went for it in Feb of this year. They pulled TU, property tax records, what color is my toilet paper, the whole works. Approved for their no-AF card 1% cashback Mastercard with a $2k limit.\u00a0\u00a0Around the same time, checked the pre-approval page at Navy and it came back with a pre-approval for any of their products. I know to take pre-approvals with a grain of salt, but I apped for the GoRewards VISA. Approved with a $3100 SL. Scores at this time were hovering around 580-ish. They pulled TU.\u00a0I am a long-time customer of B of A, and they had been sending me pre-approvals for a while for various versions of their 99/500 partially secured card. Then in March I had an \"offer\" on my banking app for their Customized Cash Rewards VISA. I apped for the unsecured version, which they immediately declined (no surprise). I had to wait 90 days to apply again, but the mail pre-approvals for the secured card kept coming once a month, and it says in the fine print that it is a firm offer of credit. I knew from reading on here that that card has great potential, so I apped in June and was approved. It's my first secured card, but it is also my most flexible rewards card. They pulled Experian. I read that they like heavy use with PIF. There's not a lot of room to maneuver with a $500 limit, but rewards are pretty decent. Internet and cell phone bills are included in their \"online shopping\" category, so it's convenient to use it for things like that, PIF, and get the cashback. We'll have to see how fast it graduates. Either way, I am very happy to have a card from an institution that is not CU or sub-prime.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In July 2023, after the 90 days/3 full statements, requested NFCU CLI. Instantly declined. They pull EQ 9, which for some reason I can't determine, is significantly lower than my other scores. Again, very discouraging. Am I doomed to be one of the few that Navy doesn't like? The decline letter did not include an internal score. In terms of rewards, it's average, so for now I am only putting small charges on there and carrying a very low balance. If I don't get an auto-CLI, I'll push the luv button again when it's been a full year.\u00a0\u00a0This week, my Mission Lane acct came up for 6-month auto-review and I received a $1k CLI ($2k to $3k).\u00a0\u00a0Also this week, I was shopping at Lowe's, and got a shopping cart (seriously!) pre-approval. I shop at Lowe's all the time and have never gotten one of those before--not even when I had a decent credit score! I was very skeptical because SyncB (Amazon) got burned in my meltdown. So instead of using the shopping cart pop-up, I went to their pre-qual page and was surprised to qualify there as well. I was still gardening but hey, you know, I shop at Lowe's a lot, and it's a good card. So I pulled the trigger and got an instant approval for $3k SL. (What!?) Yes, I know that those cards grow very fast, and a lot of people immediately ask for a higher SL, but I didn't. I don't need the temptation and also don't want to poke the bear.\u00a0Just a cautionary note: they only asked for last 4 of the SS#, so I expected a SP. Somehow they still got a HP on TU.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this time scores are hanging around 610-ish for TU and EQ 8, with EX lagging behind. SyncB reported the trade line to TU immediately (like, the VERY NEXT DAY). CLI with ML has not yet been reported, so, between the two, hoping for a small score increase. Hope this helps someone.\u00a0", "label": "Rebuilding Your Credit", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Rebuilding-Your-Credit/Rebuilding-and-approvals-DPs/td-p/6710709"}, {"title": "Is my logic reasonable; next steps on paying CO?

This forum was so helpful to me when I was trying to fix my credit to buy a house and then after a number of years of putting into action everything I learned here, my credit was fixed, I had a very high Fico and was able to buy a house. I'm worried 20+ year repossession has come to ruin everything all over again. I did speak to an attorney, but he could only speak generally and not guarantee I was not in the process of being sued. So what's going on? Well in the pass couple weeks I've been getting restricted calls. I don't ever answer those. Then I got a call from a random 866 or something number. I did answer that for some reason. It was a woman wanting me to identify myself for a \"personal matter\". She asked me to confirm my address. I refused saying I was not falling for a scam; she said it wasn't a scam and I hung up. Then today, a bill collector left a message on my work phone. The message said I was being sued and that this call was the equivalent of me being served. So I called back the number certain this was a mistake. I don't owe anything but some medical bills from a hospital stay dating back to Novemember and I am going to pay those shortly. I know they are not in collections or anywhere near being put into collections. So when I call the number, I give the person the case number that was left on my voicemail. Turns out this is a creditor trying to collect money owed on a repossession from 2000--23 years ago. He used a lot of scare tactics saying I only had 30 minutes to pay or they would take me to court and I wouldn't be able to settle in court and this was my only chance to work out a payment plan. I didn't acknowledge this was my debt, but I said a debt from 2000, there has to be some statue of limitations attached. The guy said it may have fallen off your credit report, but the debt doesn't go away and then he said something about payment in 2018, which I definitely didn't make. He also said when you're doing a bit better financially, which we can see you're doing better, we can come back and demand payment. He started reading from my credit report telling me how much availabe credit I had on different cards and that they can take the amount do from one of those. It was all very dismaying and confusing. I asked him to send me paperwork and he said it was already sent and then he went back to bullying tactics saying they would put a lean on my house (he named my bank and said they would call them to put the lien on my house) and finally I asked for paperwork again and I said I don't know that this is a debt I owe and they need to send me paperwork. He hung up. That's when I called the attorney who helped me close on my house. Again, he said it sounded like a scam and that there are processes that people need to go through to sue me and that if he wouldn't send me paperwork that was a red flag he wasn't legitimate. He also said that when I bought my house three years ago that if there was a judgment against me that I didn't know about it would have come up then because the title company does a judgement review, so they likely don't have a judgement.\u00a0 Again, he said he can't guarantee this isn't on the up and up, but that if they continue to call me I needed to take the telephone number (as they never identified themselves by a businesss name and when you Google the number, nothing comes up) and file a police report for harrassment and file with the FCC . I'm definitely going to follow the lawyer's advice, but just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar surrounding a really old repossession and can offer some insight. My student loans were just forgiven and I am currently waiting for that to fall off my report. I'd be devastated if a 20 year old repossession was suddenly added to my credit report. I'm worked so hard to get my Fico score and to feel financially stable.\u00a0Sigh. Also, my current EX FICO is 780. I don't know how to update my signature anymore.

When I started college, I didn't have the credit history to obtain a private student loan for tuition expenses, and I didn't know anyone who would co-sign for me -- and my parents weren't in the position to do so either. Having a decent job at the time, I had the 'bright idea' to obtain a personal loan through my credit union (Founders FCU in SC) to pay for my tuition expenses. Each year I borrowed a little more to pay for each semester -- the loan ended up reaching a whopping $10,000. My credit union also talked me into applying for a credit card -- which I did and had a limit of $5,000. My fall semester of college I lost the job I had throughout college, and having no income until my internship started the next summer, I wasn't able to make the payments and they eventually went into charge off status. Also, during my Junior year in college, my grandmother needed a loan for medical expenses, and her credit not being good enough to qualify on her own, I agreed to co-sign for her, which was dumb, I know. It was a smaller open line of credit ($2,500) at State Employees Credit Union in NC. Around 6 months in, she couldn't make the payments, so I paid it off for her. Unknown to me, she took out an advance on the line right before she passed, and I found out shortly after and was stuck with the bill, and that did not help with the fact that I had lost my job and was already drowning in debt that I could not pay. That account went into charged off status as well shortly after. I paid off this charged off account last month since it was the lowest one I had. I have been in a relationship for a couple years, we recently moved in together, and the struggle of being approved as a co-applicant due to my credit made me realize that I needed to get my credit back in shape. It's easy to give up and forget about it, but I know that in the next 3-5 years we will want to buy a house, and I don't want to be the one who makes it difficult because I haven't addressed my credit situation. I have attempted a settlement and payment arrangement with Founders FCU and they have suprisingly been very difficult to work with -- they will not settle and will not make a payment arrangement with me. They also told me that they have filed a judgement. The loan through Founders is still accruing interest as well, but the credit card is not.\u00a0I got a secured loan through NFCU in March for $300 at a 6 month term, after that aged and I made my last payment, it boosted my score 42 points, and the State Employees line of credit reporting as paid, it boosted my score 12 points. What do I do now? I make $45,000/year ($3,210/month) -- getting a pay raise to $55,000 soon.

We are here to help! \u00a0I will add to this thread as needed, and if you also have any suggestions you'd like to me to add, PM me!\u00a0COMMON ABBREVIATIONS:BK/BK7/BK13 = Bankruptcy/Bankruptcy Chapter 7/ Bankruptcy Chapter 13MOC = Meeting of CreditorsDC = DischargeCC = Credit cardsIIB = Included in BankruptcyDL = Driver's LicenseSSC/SSN = Social Security Card/Social Security Number\u00a0PRE-FILING FOR BK:\u00a0- OK...so you've decided to go ahead and file for Bankruptcy. \u00a0I would start by googling Bankrutpcy Laws for your state, and do a little research \u00a0regarding it, and do a practice \"means test\" for your state as well. \u00a0Most common BK's areBK7 (total liquidation, assest/non-assest) & BK13 (3-5 year payback plan) filings, and the means test will depend a lot on which one you'll be most likely be able to file.\u00a0\u00a0- You can also file your own BK to save money, by researching, How to file for BK without an attorney for your state, and then download the template to fill out. There's a lot involved, and even though we dont recommend this style due to all the specifics involved, its an option available. We have a few posters who filed their own \u00a0BK here on the forums, and they can help answer questions regarding this. One poster is\u00a0@CreditInspired\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0Next, do your research on attorney's in your city who specialize solely in BK's, and make an appt with a couple of them (consults are usually free), and they tell you their price for filing up front, which can be anywhere from low end $1000 up to $2500, depending on how big your BK is, what type, \u00a0and the details. For Example...assest vs non-assest, etc, and also where you live play a role in price.\u00a0\u00a0- Before you file, your attorney might recommend that you STOP making payments on you CC's, and other creditors, and to move your banking to a bank or CU that you wont be burning in the BK. \u00a0This is because once you file, all your lenders/creditors will get notice of your filing, and some will suspend your banking accounts you have with them, especially CU's due to the cross collateralization clause most have, and your other accts will be closed.\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\"Can I pay a few lenders before I file\"? \u00a0Answer is , no. That would be considered \"preferrential treatment of a creditor\", and could get your BK dismissed once the trustee finds out, and they will find out, as you'll be providing all sorts of documents to your attorney for the filing such as, W2's, 6-12 mo of pay stubs, insurance policies, credit card statements, \u00a0etc.\u00a0- With that said....you can pay your livable bills...like house, car, (if you're not already behind in payments), \u00a0electricity, food, medical needs/medication...the basic needs. You cant go crazy before filing and charge up all your CC's, \u00a0as that is fraud, and you should STOP using your CC's at least 90 days before filing!. \u00a0Your attorney will advise you on everything pre-filing in your initial consultation.\u00a0\u00a0Here is a great thread from poster\u00a0@Tuscani\u00a0 to refer to BEFORE filing as well......\u00a0https://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Bankruptcy/Bankruptcy-pre-planning-tips/m-p/5680446#M65510\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FILING:- So you've had your consultation, did the means test, paid your attorney. \u00a0Your attorney will tell you what date they will file your particular BK on (7 or 13), \u00a0and will also let you know what you need to be doing in the meatime, like any paperwork you need to start getting together for the next step of the process......which will be your MOC. \u00a0That takes place usually 30-45 days after your filing.\u00a0\u00a0- During this time of actual filing, the CRA's will pick it up almost immediately, and your credit scores will drop drastically. (mine dropped 150 pts once they got wind of the filing). DO NOT BE ALARMED! This is all normal, and typical. Eventually over the next couple of months, your scores will start rebounding. \u00a0One by one your accounts will start closing on your reports once the lenders have received notice as well, and your scores could take another dive. Again, dont be alarmed!!\u00a0- Once you filed for BK, you now have the protection from the federal BK courts, and the \"automatic stay\" is now in place. This means, NO lender/creditor can try to collect on any account...period. \u00a0You can now answer your phone! Its ok! Tell them you filed for BK on such and such date, and give them you BK attorney's name and #. That will be the last you'll hear them. If they continue to call you, have your attorney take care of it.\u00a0\u00a0- Now that you're filed, you can go on with your daily life. While you're waiting for your MOC to happen, provide your attorney with whatever they are asking for as far as paperwork, as they will be forwarding it to the the trustee now assigned to your case. Dont forget to relax, breathe, trust in the process, and it will all be over with soon. \u00a0Register with PACER and follow your BK filing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MOC:Your MOC is finally here. First, dont panic! It will be over in 5-10 min, not kidding! \u00a0 Make sure you brought with you your DL and SSC for verification!\u00a0~ Don't dress to the nines...You're filing BK, you dont want to look like you just stepped out of Neiman Marcus or Brooks Brothers! \u00a0You want to look like you cant afford anything! \u00a0Actually, jeans and a casual shirt is OK. \u00a0Ladies, dont take the designer purse in with you, minimal make-up, casual attire...leave the jewelry at home as well. \u00a0See where I'm going with all this?? Look like you needed to file your BK.\u00a0\u00a0- The MOC is actually just that. \u00a0Most creditors DO NOT show up, but in the off chance one does, \u00a0 you and your attorney will already have known beforehand, so its not a surprise. Let your attorney handle things.\u00a0\u00a0- You will sit in the court room with your attorney waiting for your name to be called. Once called, you and your attoney will stand, and walk to the front, and will be sworn in under oath in front of the trustee and the judge overseeing things. \u00a0They will basically ask you to verify your name, DOB, etc.. If the trustee asks you a direct question, \u00a0answer it honestly. \u00a0He or she will then tell you that they are done, and call the next person. \u00a0Then you leave! You're done with your MOC!\u00a0\u00a0- At this point your attorney may tell you its ok to go ahead and start rebuilding. We highly advise you to NOT try until after your official DC!! A lot can happen from the \u00a0time of MOC to DC, \u00a0like your case could get dismissed for presumption of abuse/fraud, \u00a0the trustee may decide to convert your BK7 case to a BK13 instead. Just dont chance it, and just wait.\u00a0\u00a0- While waiting for your DC, you should be montioring your reports to make sure everything is updating to show $0 balance and the included in bankruptcy comment on each account.\u00a0 Your scores will also be flucuating hopefully for the better at this point and start rising. Also, take this time to read the following threads for rebuilding. They have good information \u00a0These threads are posted in the next comments\u00a0DISCHARGE!!\u00a0You're finally discharged, YAY! Congrats on your new founded freedom and you can now start the rebuilding process. \u00a0Here are a few great rebuilding threads to refer too for rebuildig.

Always seek a reputable bankruptcy lawyer to answer your questions prior to filing. \u00a0- Tuscani\u00a0---\u00a0Should I file Bankruptcy? \u00a0A person should file a bankruptcy if, and only if, he or she can\u2019t pay bills as they come due or is about to lose property or have property attached by the Court. Very few people lose any property when they file bankruptcy. \u00a0Filing a bankruptcy is generally better than having a foreclosure on your credit record. A person will often be able to rebuild credit and buy a house within 2 years after a bankruptcy. A repossession can do more damage to your credit, and it may take much, much longer to recover. Government regulations may forever keep you from financing a home with the VA or FHA if you have a repossession for a home, but allows financing 2 years after bankruptcy. Only 7 magical items may not be bankrupted: Child Support and Alimony; taxes less than 3 years old; federally guaranteed student loans; debts due to fraud; debts due to drunk driving; debts due to intentional injuries; and criminal restitution. There are many exceptions to even these. A driver\u2019s license can be reinstated by filing, if you lost your license because of unpaid damages for an auto accident. When in doubt, always list the debt when filing: It may be bankruptable due to an exception.\u00a0What does it cost to file bankruptcy? \u00a0After October 2005, Court costs are about$300 for a Chapter 7 and $275 for a Chapter 13. After October 2005 Chapter 7 attorney fees run about $1000 plus any filing fees. Chapter 13 Attorney fees are set by the Court.\u00a0What happens when I file? \u00a0When you file a bankruptcy, a Court order goes into effect immediately stopping all collection activity. This includes stopping foreclosures, attachments, garnishments, and Creditors calling you. The sooner you come in to the law office, the sooner you can get relief\u2014and the more you can save from Creditors. You will have a 341 hearing within about 4 to 6 weeks after the bankruptcy is filed. When the bankruptcy is finally over, a discharge is issued. This is a final and permanent order to stop all collection activity and declaring the debts to be non collectable. Bankruptcy does not normally get rid of a security interest that you gave to a Creditor such as a mortgage or a standard car lien, but it does make you not liable for the debt.\u00a0Can I plan my bankruptcy?\u00a0Of course! Good planning is why you read this thread and allows you to save more money and property. Just like taking proper tax exemptions. There is nothing illegal or improper with properly taking the exemptions.\u00a0Which bankruptcy is right for me: Chapter 13 or Chapter 7? \u00a0A Chapter 13 is like a bill consolidation loan, and you normally file it to keep property and stop foreclosures. A Chapter 7 is used to completely wipe out unsecured debts and to get rid of secured debts for property you don't want to keep. Both will stop garnishments and Creditor harassment. If you earn more than the average wage for your state and size of family you will normally be required to file a Chapter 13.\u00a0Chapter 13 cases are becoming more popular. Over 95% of all Chapter 13 cases used to fail because they became unaffordable. But now 10 and 20% repayment plans are being approved in Chapter 13 cases and they are now more successful. After 10-2005 plans below 10% will be common. Often an attorney may want to file a Chapter 13 because he or she will earn more than he would in a Chapter 7, but you will usually profit far more from filing a Chapter 7. Usually, the only times you will want to file a Chapter 13 are 1) when you have already filed a Chapter 7 and can't file another one or 2) if you have so much property and equity that a Chapter 13 is necessary to keep that property.\u00a0You may have to file a Chapter 13 if you have so much income (after you pay your normal monthly living expenses) that you can repay something to your debts. A Chapter 13 can no longer be used for special purposes, such as to debts due to fraud. But can repay child support, repay student loans, or protect a co-signer. The fortunate thing about virtually all Chapter 7 cases is that the Debtor\u2019s assets are normally exempt, so there are rarely any assets to liquidate. \u00a0Each state has different rules for what property can be kept.\u00a0Why file a Chapter 7? \u00a0If you have substantial unsecured debts you may want to file a Chapter 7. You may also want to file a Chapter 7 if you want to surrender property and not owe for it. You can usually keep all your property in a Chapter 7, because you won't have enough equity in any property to exceed the exemptions allowed.\u00a0Why file a Chapter 13? \u00a0You may want to file a Chapter 13 if you have secured debts and are threatened with foreclosure or repossession, if you filed a Chapter 7 less than 6 years ago, if you wish to protect your cosigner, or if you have debts that are not dischargeable in a Chapter 7 but are payable in a Chapter 13. Child support can be paid first in a Chapter 13 before secured creditors giving you the advantage of not losing a car or property but having all of your payments go to child support at the start of the case.\u00a0Can I convert from a Chapter 13 to a 7 or from a 7 to a 13? \u00a0Yes they can be converted. Few people convert from a 7 to a 13. However if you earn over 60-70,000 you have a strong chance that the US attorney\u2019s office will file a 707 b motion that may force you into a 13. If you file a Chapter 13 you have a good chance that you will have to convert from a 13 to a 7. Over 3-5 years, you are very likely to miss payments and have the Chapter 13 dismissed (or have to refile). Some Chapter 13 cases are never finished and are converted into Chapter 7 cases. If you are close to completing the plan, you may be granted a hardship discharge. Plans can also be later modified if incomes change.\u00a0What is a Chapter 20? What is a Chapter 26? \u00a0Some people file a Chapter 7 to wipe out unsecured debts and then file a Chapter 13 to keep their property. This is jokingly referred to as a \u201cChapter 20\u201d. Filing a \u201cChapter 20\u201d can be the intelligent and affordable way to file a Chapter 13 later. Filing a Chapter 7 and then a Chapter 13 to obtain the benefits of both is very effective in stopping a foreclosure. A \u201cChapter 26\u201d refers to filing back-to-back Chapter 13 cases. You would do this to pay debts that can\u2019t be paid in 5 years by just one Chapter 13. In a sense, you are \u201cextending\u201d your repayment time by filing two Chapter 13s. These forms of filing are no longer available after 10-2005.\u00a0How long will bankruptcy take? \u00a0It will take about 3 to 4 months for a Chapter 7 to be final. (You will get a letter within 10 days of filing, telling you the time and date of the 341 hearing. This hearing will be held about 4 to 6 weeks after you file.) A Chapter 13 will take as long as the repayment plan takes. If you file after 10-2005 before getting a discharge you will attend a hearing.\u00a0What are the most common mistakes I can make when filing? \u00a0Not showing up for your hearing and not listing all of your debts. Fail to show up at the hearing, and your case is dismissed. Fail to list a debt, and you continue to owe it. Also people often have too much in a checking account when they file or a tax refund coming. The best policy is to list all your debts and assets. Always list every debt, even if you think it is nondischargeable, it may be discharged anyway. Even include last month\u2019s utilities.\u00a0How do I qualify for bankruptcy? Can I not be approved? \u00a0You qualify for bankruptcy if either your outgo exceeds your income or your liabilities exceed your assets. You basically have to be a US citizen, reside in the state you file in, and not have filed within certain time periods (you can\u2019t file two Chapter 7s within 8 years of each other).\u00a0\u00a0What if the Court does not approve my Chapter 13 or Chapter 7?\u00a0\u00a0If there is anything wrong with your Chapter 13 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy it will usually be changed and amended. Of course, it is less costly and time-consuming to do it right the first time. If you earn so much money that you can afford a Chapter 13, you will be forced to change it from a Chapter 7 to a Chapter 13. Repayment plans often are amended.\u00a0How often can I file? \u00a0You can file a Chapter 7 8 years after you filed your last Chapter 7 the time used to be 6 before 10-2005. The time is measured from the time of filing your first case to the time of filing of your second case. You can file Chapter 13s 2 years after a Chapter 13 discharge. You can file a Chapter 7 4 years after a Chapter 13. You can only have one bankruptcy going on at a time.\u00a0If I file does it mean my old bad debts are erased from my credit report? \u00a0NO!\u00a0What is reported is that you had a debt and that a bankruptcy was filed. Bankruptcy does not give you a good credit record or \u201crepair\u201d your credit record automatically. You repair your credit by paying your debts on time after the bankruptcy.\u00a0Can I file without an Attorney? \u00a0Yes. You can file a bankruptcy yourself, and this is called \u201cfiling pro se\u201d. You can also do dentistry on yourself, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Doing your own case is a very bad idea. This thread alone won\u2019t give you the knowledge you need to file on your own. Use this thread to educate yourself, so you can find a good Attorney and discuss the issues.\u00a0As an example, if you file a reaffirmation and represent yourself, it must be approved in a hearing by the Judge, and that will mean extra hearings and time for you. Considering the time and risk involved, I recommend you use an Attorney. You may lose far more\u00a0in Court than what the Attorney would have cost\u2014plus there is the extra time and effort on your part doing the work.\u00a0What about a Bankruptcy Mill? \u00a0Filing a bankruptcy through a Bankruptcy Mill or paralegal may be even worse than doing it yourself and they often charge as much as the attorney. Many people have lost thousands of dollars with these businesses\u2014through intentional scams or just plain bad work. Non-Attorney bankruptcy petition preparers are barred by law from providing you with any legal advice. In enacting legislation governing bankruptcy petition preparers, Congress stated: \u201cThese preparers lack the necessary legal training and ethics regulation to provide [legal advice and legal services] in an adequate and appropriate manner. These services may take unfair advantage of persons who are ignorant of their rights both inside and outside the bankruptcy system.\u201d\u00a0The bankruptcy petition preparer's role is limited by law solely to typing. Unlike an Attorney, a bankruptcy petition preparer can not help you understand the law, advise you how to answer questions, assist you in planning, or be in Court. Federal law requires that bankruptcy petition preparers sign any documents they prepare; print on the document their name, address, and social security number; and furnish you with a copy of the document. \u00a0A bankruptcy petition preparer may not sign any document on your behalf, may not use the word \u201clegal\u201d or any similar term in any advertisement, and may not receive any payment from you for Court fees. The bankruptcy petition preparer is also required to disclose to the Court the amount of any fee you pay. Beware of any bankruptcy petition preparer who does not comply with these requirements an emergency, even the filing fee can be paid in payments to the Court. \u00a0\u00a0What paperwork do I need to bring to my Attorney? \u00a0Bring the names, amounts, account numbers and proper addresses of all of your Creditors. You may estimate the amounts. After 10-2005 you must have the account numbers. Credit bureau reports normally don't have the addresses on them. If you have gotten a Credit bureau report before filing, you still have to get the addresses.\u00a0Can I file jointly with my spouse? Does my spouse have to file or sign if I want to file individually? \u00a0Yes, you can file jointly. No, your spouse doesn't have to file but, if most of your debts are joint debts, he or she may want to. There is no need for a spouse to file if the debts are not in his or her name. If you are filing a Chapter 7, and the bills are also in your spouse\u2019s name, he or she generally should file to be protected. (Cosigners are protected in a 13 with 100% plans, but are not in a Chapter 7.) There should be no additional charge for a spouse filing, but some firms charge extra. The only extra work to do in a joint filing is adding an additional name and social security number to the petition.\u00a0Will it affect my spouse\u2019s credit? Is he/she responsible for my credit cards if he/she is an authorized user? \u00a0No, filing will not affect your spouse's individual credit, but if he or she is a co-signer on any debt that is not paid that will affect him or her. The fact that you filed bankruptcy does not appear on a spouse's credit report unless he or she also files bankruptcy. Unless your spouse has signed to be legally responsible, they are not responsible. However, many credit card companies will argue that she is responsible. They may even put a \u201cno pay\u201d on her credit report if the amount is unpaid; however, she may ask any credit reporting service to correct that. \u00a0If she does so, the credit card company will have to show that she signed for it. If they can\u2019t, it will be removed from her credit report file. In other words, the credit card collectors may try to collect from her by claiming she is liable, but she really is not. If they damage her credit record, it may be grounds for a lawsuit. Credit is normally granted based on a score from your past payment history, the amount of debt that you owe, the length of time you have been repaying present credit, if you have opened credit recently, and the types of credit accounts you have.\u00a0Will my co-signers be protected? \u00a0Co-signers are protected only in a Chapter 13 to the extent that the plan pays the full amount of the co-signed debt. If the plan pays the debt completely, the co-signer is protected, but it will be listed in his or her credit record as being paid late. The Creditor may ask the cosigner for any remaining portion of the debt if it not paid completely. In a Chapter 7, the co-signer will have some small protection regarding the collateral during the proceeding, but only because the Creditor can\u2019t go against the property of the estate. After a Chapter 7 is over, the Creditor will proceed against the co-signer personally.\u00a0Can I file a personal bankruptcy and not have it affect my business? \u00a0If you own your own business, the business is a part of your assets. If it is worth very much, it may be property of the Court. If your business files bankruptcy, it won\u2019t affect you because the business does not own you.\u00a0Can Bankruptcy stop foreclosures, wage assignments, help me get my license back from an uninsured accident, stop evictions, a judgment, or remove a lien? \u00a0Yes.\u00a0What will happen to my bills? \u00a0When you file a bankruptcy, a Court order goes into effect that keeps Creditors from legally collecting from you. When you are discharged (i.e., the bankruptcy is final), the Creditor \"charges off\" the debt and gets a tax deduction for the loss. The bill is not paid, and the debt shows up as a bankruptcy charge-off on your credit report. Some Creditors will attempt to get around the law and will continue attempts to collect after the bankruptcy is filed. They can be sued for this, but you need to prove they did it. One of the best methods is to record their call and then surprise them in Court with it when they deny ever making the call. Most Creditors that ignore the law will never send you letters or anything on paper after you file, but they may make phone calls hoping that you will pay anyway.\u00a0What if I keep getting bills? \u00a0You will continue to get some bills from bankrupted debts after you file. What happens is that the Bankruptcy Court sends out notices to the addresses that you give to them (that is why correct addresses are so important), but some Creditors never get these notices and continue to bill you. You should make copies of your hearing notice. If you get a bill from a Creditor, send them a copy of the bill and the notice. Some Creditors will continue to send bills even if they receive notice. It may be that their computer can\u2019t stop sending out the bills, or they may simply be ignoring the stay hoping that you will pay anyway. You can file a motion for contempt with the judge, and you may also be able to sue for a violation of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act.\u00a0Do I have to pay my bills during the Chapter 7 or 13?\u00a0No. Don\u2019t pay any bill until after you file a Chapter 7 until you have negotiated with the creditor to keep the property. Don\u2019t pay any payment in a Chapter 13 unless it is the regular monthly mortgage payment or car payment, and the 13 was filed to catch up the arrearage. A stay is a federal Court order to stop. If the item is secured, your overdue payments will continue to add up while you don\u2019t pay on the item. However, the Creditor can't take the collateral until the stay is terminated. If no reaffirmation is filed within 45 days after the bankruptcy is filed the stay terminates and the bank can take the car. \u00a0The Creditor may also file a motion to terminate the stay after the bankruptcy is filed. Bankruptcy stops your obligation to pay, but the Creditor still has a lien and rights in the property. You often quit paying for items when you file so that you have time to decide if you want to workout a repayment, redeem, or surrender. I have rarely ever had a bank refuse to agree to repayment, but you don\u2019t want to make payments if they aren't going to let you keep the property. Singing a reaffirmation will make you liable for any deficiency if you have it repossessed later. In some rare cases, with people who are never going to repay, the bank may refuse to reaffirm. Some credit unions may refuse to keep a car or mortgage unless you also repay their credit cards. In cases like this, you may want to redeem property instead. That is why you don\u2019t want to make payments just before or after you file. You can take the time to negotiate your options. You don\u2019t have to be caught up on your payments to reaffirm, but some banks may request it\u2014and all of them want it.\u00a0Who notifies the Creditors and bill collectors? \u00a0After the bankruptcy petition is filed, the Court mails a notice to all the Creditors listed in the schedules. This usually takes 1-2 weeks.\u00a0Do I have to go to Court? \u00a0Not exactly, but you will have to attend a hearing presided over by the bankruptcy Trustee. This hearing is called the 341 Hearing (Meeting of Creditors). At this hearing, the Trustee (who is an Attorney) will ask questions, under oath, regarding the content of your bankruptcy papers, assets, debts, and other matters. It is very much like a deposition, not like a trial. If you can\u2019t attend (example: if you are in the service overseas), you can answer the questions by Affidavit. The Trustee is not the judge. He is there to take any assets from you, if he can, and to check the accuracy of your paperwork. The Trustee represents the banks\u2014not you. In a Chapter 13 you will have a second hearing to get your discharge if your case was filed after October 2005. In this hearing you must show that you are no charged or convicted of a crime of fraud or further behind in support.\u00a0Where is my 341 hearing? \u00a0Your 341 hearing is always at the Federal Court closest to you.\u00a0What do I wear to the hearing? \u00a0Don\u2019t wear cut-offs or jeans with holes in them and don\u2019t wear sandals. Suits are not required, but dress properly for a hearing in Federal Court. Children are not supposed to be in the hearing room. Do not borrow and wear flashy jewelry. This is not the time to brag about how rich you are or how much you own. The Trustee is looking for assets to take from you. He is not your friend. He represents the persons that you owe. You must report what you own and it\u2019s real value, but don\u2019t brag about your income and how much your car is worth\u2014especially if you don\u2019t have any. \u00a0When should I file tax returns if I am going to file bankruptcy? If I file in December do I keep my refund? \u00a0If you are considering filing a bankruptcy, you must file your tax returns. No file returns\u2026. no file bankruptcy. If you can get your refund before you file. If you do and spend it, you will keep your refund no matter how much it is. If you get your refund after you file bankruptcy, and the refund is over the exemption, you may lose part of your refund. File a quick refund if you have to or apply any refund amount to next year\u2019s tax debt. If you are considering filing in the later part of the year, file before December. If you file in January, you may have to wait for some time after you get your refund back. You will be asked when you got your refund and how you spent it if you got a large refund. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Message Edited by Tuscani on 10-01-2007 12:47 PM", "label": "Bankruptcy", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Bankruptcy/Bankruptcy-FAQs/td-p/74796"}, {"title": "About this board....", "date": "2007-09-27 12:46:00", "content": "Welcome to the FICO Forums Bankruptcy board!\u00a0This is the place to share\u00a0personal experiences and expertise regarding:Reestablishing a good credit history\u00a0following bankruptcyHow filing bankruptcy impacts FICO scoresWhen\u00a0you should\u00a0consider bankruptcyAlternatives to filing\u00a0to bankruptcyBefore you post, make sure to read the Credit Repair Discussion Guidelines.We hope you find this board informative.-BarryMessage Edited by Raine on  01-13-2009 01:01 PM", "label": "Bankruptcy", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Bankruptcy/About-this-board/td-p/73210"}, {"title": "Copy of FTC Staff Opinion Letter re: No reporting of Chargeoffs or Lates after FILING Date", "date": "2016-01-29 01:20:00", "content": "I had a number of accounts that were current at the time of filing chapter 7. \u00a0No lates, not in chargeoff status. \u00a0I have been trying to find this FTC letter for awhile (in full -- not just mention of it) and located it. \u00a0I intend to use this in a written dispute for each account sent to each CRA\u00a0by mail and also to the original creditors insisting that they remove these chargeoff/late pays after filing date.\u00a0I am also attaching a very old link from 2006 from a different site discussing the ins and outs of this. \u00a0It is the best discussion I have ever found on the topic.\u00a0FTC Advisor Opinion Letter: \u00a0\u00a0https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advisory-opinions/advisory-opinion-lovern-04-24-98\u00a0(Old) extensive discussion about the reporting requirements. \u00a0Good ammo for creating dispute letters:\u00a0\u00a0(Mod Cut - Im sorry links to this site are not permitted on myFico)\u00a0I hope this will help others. \u00a0I am ordering my\u00a0paper reports from each CRA so I can see precisely how they are wording each account. \u00a0Under payment status it needs to say (included in bankruptcy) and not as a chargeoff.\u00a0Good luck. \u00a0I hope this helps others.", "label": "Bankruptcy", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Bankruptcy/Copy-of-FTC-Staff-Opinion-Letter-re-No-reporting-of-Chargeoffs/td-p/4433858"}, {"title": "How to Select a Legitimate Credit Counseling Agency", "date": "2008-07-11 12:30:00", "content": "How to Select a Legitimate Credit Counseling Agency\u00a0\u00a0The last thing a consumer needs when struggling financially is to fall into the hands of an unscrupulous credit counseling agency.\u00a0 If you\u2019re considering using a credit counselor, shop around, and ask each agency the following questions.\u00a0 More importantly, be certain that you are comfortable with their answers before you book that first appointment.\u00a0 A legitimate agency is always more interested in your bottom line than theirs.\u00a0Is the agency affiliated with a national body such as the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) that requires strict quality, financial and ethical standards for membership?\u00a0 Examples of such requirements are annual audits by an independent CPA, written action plans provided to each consumer, and consumers provided with statements at least quarterly.\u00a0Is the agency accredited by an independent third party?\u00a0 Self-accreditation is not the answer you want.\u00a0 An example of a reputable third party accreditating body is the Council on Accreditation (COA).\u00a0 Such accreditation signifies that appropriate checks and balances are in place to protect you, the consumer.\u00a0Is the agency a 501(c)(3) nonprofit community organization? \u00a0Being a nonprofit does not guarantee that the agency is legitimate, but it is a step in the right direction.\u00a0What is the composition of their Board of Directors? \u00a0Board members should not be paid by the agency, should not be family members or friends, but should represent a wide cross-section of the community and civic interests.\u00a0What services does the agency offer?\u00a0 A wide-range of services is a good sign.\u00a0 This could include: budget counseling for those who are not in debt; debt counseling for those who may need professional assistance digging out; housing counseling for pre-rental, pre-purchase, first-time homebuyer, reverse mortgage, and foreclosure prevention; and the mandated bankruptcy pre-filing counseling and pre-discharge education.\u00a0What are the fees associated with the services provided?\u00a0 The agency should be forthcoming about fees, and no fee should be assessed prior to the service being provided.\u00a0 Be wary if the agency says their fees are voluntary.\u00a0 Any set-up fee or monthly fee should be reasonable, usually defined as $50 or less, with monthly fees in the $25 range.\u00a0 The agency should be willing to waive all fees in cases of true hardship.\u00a0What delivery options are available to you for counseling? \u00a0Does the agency offer in-person counseling?\u00a0 Counseling by phone?\u00a0 Internet counseling?\u00a0 Is the channel that\u2019s most appealing to you offered?\u00a0Is the counselor assigned to you a Certified Consumer Credit Counselor? \u00a0You want someone qualified assisting you with your critical financial decisions.\u00a0 NFCC certification means that the counselor has passed a rigorous battery of tests measuring their financial knowledge.\u00a0Does the agency provide educational classes or workshops? \u00a0Are any of these tools offered online?\u00a0 Is there a fee to attend?\u00a0 The absence of any true education offered to the general public is a red flag.\u00a0Will the agency work with all of your creditors?\u00a0 Some agencies only work with creditors who agree to make a payment to them.\u00a0 A legitimate agency will take a holistic approach to solving your financial distress.\u00a0Is there a minimum amount of debt required to be counseled?\u00a0 True credit counseling agencies will work with you regardless of how large or how small your debt may be.\u00a0What debt relief options are offered? \u00a0If the only tool is the Debt Management Plan (DMP), keep shopping.\u00a0 A DMP is a useful tool, and is often the appropriate resolution.\u00a0 However, each consumer\u2019s situation is different, thus the solution should be customized to fit their specific needs.\u00a0 A one-size-fits-all approach signals that you should continue your search.\u00a0Are the counselors compensated for writing DMPs? \u00a0Any such incentive is not a part of a legitimate agency\u2019s pay to their counselors.\u00a0How long will your counseling session last? \u00a0Don\u2019t be tempted by \u201cdrive-by\u201d counseling.\u00a0 A counselor simply cannot do an adequate intake of your income, expenses and debts in a short amount of time.\u00a0 An initial session length of at least one-hour is standard.\u00a0If you go on a Debt Management Plan, how soon after receipt of your monthly payment will it be disbursed to creditors? \u00a0The success of a DMP depends on timely, consistent payments to creditors.\u00a0What happens to your first payment?\u00a0 Believe it or not, some agencies keep the consumers first payment and consider it a donation.\u00a0 Be sure to ask about this.\u00a0Will the full amount of your payment be disbursed to your creditors? \u00a0The full amount should go toward the repayment of your debts, with no portion going into the agency\u2019s pocket.\u00a0How will your deposits be protected?\u00a0 Ask for written evidence that the agency is bonded or insured to protect the consumer from fraud or the agency\u2019s own financial difficulties.\u00a0As a final step, check with the Better Business Bureau and your state\u2019s Attorney General to see if there are unresolved complaints about the provider you are considering.\u00a0 Anyone can file a complaint.\u00a0 What is relevant is how the agency resolved it.\u00a0Legitimate credit counseling agencies counsel and financially educate millions of consumers each year, making financial stability a reality in their lives.\u00a0 It all starts with selecting the right agency.\u00a0 Asking the above questions, and receiving the right answers, will ensure that your credit counseling experience is a positive one.", "label": "Bankruptcy", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/Bankruptcy/How-to-Select-a-Legitimate-Credit-Counseling-Agency/td-p/287470"}, {"title": "Ch13 payments", "date": "2023-09-25 08:48:00", "content": "Hello there,\u00a0\u00a0So 09/17/2023 marked my 60th month of me filing my Ch13. \u00a0Haven't heard or seen anything on NDC or PACER.

Have been doing a lot of reading and I think i am heading in the right direction but want to hear from people that have actually gone through the process.\u00a0\u00a0A little background history:Had some financial trouble in 2016-18 and a lot of my cards ended up being closed/charged off. A number of them went to collections, wasn\u2019t well versed on things and didn\u2019t go to court and some ended up with a judgement. A good number of those cards have fallen off the credit reports but some of the collections are still there.\u00a0\u00a0Income:\u00a0Covid resulted in my wife not having an income. She went back to work July \u201922 full time and then reduced to PT in April \u201923. She started doing cake recipes and started getting small partnerships in the middle of 2022. From then to now, its probably been about $6K plus her\u00a0@$26K in part time wages.\u00a0\u00a0I left my staff position at a community college in July \u201922 after being there for 9 years. This resulted in a large retirement withdrawal ($50K). This was used to pay some overdue debt, get some new things for us and the kids and then was used to cover bills, expenses, rent. I went back to work FT in Feb\u201923. Work from home.\u00a0$54K income.\u00a0My family (Wife, 2 Kids and I) live outside of Boston, MA. We rent ($2K), have 2 cars- both under my name.

Credit monitoring for Experian and TransUnion may not begin for up to 72 hours (or more in the case of TransUnion) after purchase. As a result, credit events that occur during this enrollment window (example NEW CREDIT CARD #2) may not trigger alerts as your enrollment into the monitoring service is not yet complete.\u00a0For TransUnion, credit events that occur even after the enrollment window may not trigger alerts because TransUnion alerts are triggered only after a baseline (i.e., your first post-enrollment credit event) is established in TransUnion\u2019s systems - so this may result in a\u00a0further delay in receiving your first alert.\u00a0 Once your first post-enrollment credit event baseline is established for TransUnion you will begin to receive TransUnion alerts for subsequent credit events. [see FAQ: When do I receive alerts about my FICO\u00ae Score?]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How does the FICO\u00ae 3-Bureau Credit Monitoring product monitor\u00a0my FICO credit score?Note: For Experian and TransUnion, the credit monitoring service may not begin for up to 72 hours.\u00a0Every time a monitored credit file change is detected by the FICO\u00ae 3-Bureau Credit Monitoring product, your current FICO\u00ae Score is also included with the alert (please note that it is possible to have the current FICO Score be the same score as you previous score). When you pull a new credit report, a FICO Score is also included with the report. As an active subscriber, your FICO Scores are updated and tracked on the FICO\u00ae Score Timeline.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the FICO\u00ae 3-Bureau Monitoring product, do I receive an alert every time my score changes?No, the FICO\u00ae 3-Bureau Credit Monitoring product only provides score updates that are the direct result of a change to a monitored credit file. This happens through the credit file monitoring feature of the product. By monitoring a consumer\u2019s credit file for key changes, the product detects changes to this file which triggers an alert containing details about the credit file change. This alert also contains an updated FICO\u00ae Score (please note that it is possible for the current FICO Score be the same as your previous score).\u00a0When do I receive alerts about changes in my FICO Score?The FICO\u00ae 3-Bureau Credit Monitoring product provides daily monitoring of all 3 CRAs for key changes in a consumer\u2019s credit file. Subscribers will receive alerts containing the credit file change and an updated FICO\u00ae Score for the following scenarios:\u00a01. \u00a0When a change on a monitored item is detected at TransUnion, Equifax or Experian, an alert with an associated current FICO Score is sent.\u00a0To illustrate this, consider\u00a0the following example:\u00a0ACTION: You apply for a new line of creditCREDIT FILE IMPLICATION: A new line of credit is now reported on your credit file and should be reported to one or more of the credit bureaus.FICO 3-BUREAU CREDIT MONITORING ALERT: Once the new line of credit is reported to one of the credit bureaus and the credit bureau notifies myFICO of the change in your credit file, the FICO 3-Bureau Credit Monitoring product generates a credit alert informing you of the change to your credit file. This alert also contains the current FICO\u00ae Score.\u00a0NOTE: It is possible for the current FICO Score to be the same as the previous score and therefore, no actual increase/decrease to the FICO Score will have occurred even though the score is current. In this case, the alert will indicate that the \u201cScore has not changed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a02. \u00a0When a FICO Score Alert is triggered specifically based on Equifax credit data\u00a0Get notified when your FICO Score based on Equifax data reaches your target scoreGet notified when your FICO Score changes and puts you into a different estimated interest rate band on one of 3 types of loans.Get notified based on customized criteria set by users (default settings can be changed within the member center via\u00a0Alert Settings) to alert for an Account Balance Change (increase or decrease) based on $ dollar amounts or % percentage amounts.3.\u00a0An alert for an Account Balance Change (increase or decrease) based on Experian credit data will be triggered when an account utilization change of 5% or more of the account\u2019s credit limit has been detected.\u00a04. After enrolling in the monitoring service, a baseline has been set at TransUnion. The initial or first credit event will set a baseline against which all future changes are measured and alerted against. So using the example below, the first NEW CREDIT CARD #1 will set the baseline and no alert will be triggered. The second NEW CREDIT CARD #2 will result in a change to the monitored baseline and should trigger a New Account Alert. What this means to you is that there will likely be a delay of when you start receiving account balance change alerts for TransUnion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What triggers an account balance change alert?Account Balance Change alerts are triggered based on changes in an account\u2019s balance and is triggered differently for each bureau. Please refer to the chart below for the specific trigger thresholds used by each bureau.\u00a0CREDIT REPORTING AGENCYTRIGGER THRESHOLD DEFAULTCONFIGURABLETransUnionChange (increase or decrease) in an aggregated account balance across all accounts greater than $1YES - Users can set notifications based on a $ dollar change.\u00a0 Default settings can be changed within the member center via\u00a0Alert SettingsExperianChange (increase or decrease) in account balance amount greater than $1 dollarYES -\u00a0Users can set notifications based on a $ dollar change.\u00a0 Default settings can be changed within the member center via\u00a0Alert SettingsEquifaxChange (increase or decrease) in account balance amount greater than $1 dollarYES \u2013 Users can set notifications based on a $ dollar change. Default settings can be changed within the member center via\u00a0Alert Settings\u00a0I opened a credit card over 10 days ago and I haven\u2019t received a credit monitoring alert or associated score update yet \u2013 why not?\u00a0 Sometimes, credit events that occur after your enrollment into the FICO\u00ae 3-Bureau Monitoring product are not immediately reported to credit reporting agencies. Because some merchants/card issuers only report on a monthly basis, this can lead to a \u201clag\u201d of over 30 days from the time the transaction occurred to the time it appears on your credit report.\u00a0EXAMPLE:I enrolled into the FICO 3-Bureau Credit Monitoring product on 8/22 and the enrollment was complete as of 8/26.The merchant did not report the new line of credit to the Credit Reporting Agency\u00a0until 8/30.The credit reporting agency\u00a0then updated its systems with the reported data on 8/31As a result, the New Account alert should trigger on or sometime after 8/31\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seems like I receive a lot more Equifax alerts \u2013 Why is that?Each bureau has different thresholds for sending an alert. Equifax alert thresholds are much lower than the other two bureaus, resulting in more alerts. However, you can customize your alert settings, a feature only available for Equifax alerts, so you receive less alerts. Simply head to the member center and configure the exact dollar or percentage amount for which you would like to trigger a credit alert along with a current FICO\u00ae Score. You can even set a target FICO Score so that when it is reached, you will receive an alert. \u00a0\u00a0As a new subscriber, the default settings for Equifax is set at the lowest threshold possible to enable the generation of credit alerts with minute credit file changes.\u00a0 As a result, \u00a0you may\u00a0notice a difference in the number of alerts generated for the same accounts across the different bureaus.Default settings can be changed within the member center via\u00a0Alert Settings:\u00a0CUSTOM SETTINGDESCRIPTIONDEFAULTSETTINGMONITORING INTERVALCONFIGURATION OPTIONSFICO Score \u2013 Target ScoreGet notified when your FICO Score based on Equifax data reaches your target score.ON - your FICO Score on subscription dateWeeklySet a target score between 300 and 850.FICO Score \u2013 FICO Score change qualifies you for a different interest rateGet notified when your FICO Score changes and may qualify you for a different interest rate on one of 3 types of loans.\u00a0ON -30 year mortgageWeekly30 year mortgage, 15 year home equity loan, 48 month auto loanAccount Balance Change \u2013 By $ dollar amountGet notified when\u00a0your account balance changes (increases or decreases) by more than $x dollar(s).\u00a0ON - $1DailySet a balance change of $1 - $99,999Account Balance Change \u2013 By % dollar amountGet notified when your account balance increases by more than x%.\u00a0OFF \u00a0DailySet a percentage of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 100%, 200%Account Balance Change - Newly Active AccountsGet notified of\u00a0new activity on an inactive account (defined as an account that has been inactive for more than specific period of time that you set).ON \u2013 3 months\u00a0DailySet an inactive period of 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months\u00a0\u00a0", "label": "myFICO\u00ae Product Feedback", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/myFICO-Product-Feedback/FICO-3-Bureau-Credit-Monitoring-FAQs-about-Monitoring-and-Alerts/td-p/3410319"}, {"title": "PLEASE READ ABOUT THIS BOARD BEFORE POSTING", "date": "2007-03-05 04:36:00", "content": "Welcome to the myFICO Product Feedback board! \u00a0We are very proud of our products and the level of service we provide at myFICO.\u00a0 We also understand that we are not perfect and that even when we are we can't please everyone all the time.\u00a0 \u00a0While this board is intended to be\u00a0the place\u00a0for myFICO customers to\u00a0share\u00a0information with others, it should not be confused with myFICO Customer Care.\u00a0 The moderators and administrators here don't always have access to the account information needed to resolve specific product-related issues for individuals, so please direct any questions that require access to your own account to myFICO Customer Care.\u00a0We very much appreciate your feedback, so let us know what you think -- whether positive or negative!\u00a0-Barry", "label": "myFICO\u00ae Product Feedback", "link": "https://ficoforums.myfico.com//t5/myFICO-Product-Feedback/PLEASE-READ-ABOUT-THIS-BOARD-BEFORE-POSTING/td-p/23"}, {"title": "MyFico question.....", "date": "2023-09-10 04:15:00", "content": "Evening all,\u00a0I'm having trouble understanding the alerts section here and I'll explain why in hopes the guru's can shed some light....\u00a0On Sept 6th I applied and was approved for a NFCU card...
