Only now, the best deals aren\\'t in the Sunbelt region but rather along the Eastern coast.\\\\u00a0At least that\\'s the view of Matt Frazier, CEO and cofounder of Jones Street Investment Partners, a multifamily investor with roughly $2 billion in assets under management. Frazier thinks the best opportunities have shifted from southern cities like Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, to smaller New England cities like Portland, Maine, as well as Mid-Atlantic hubs like Richmond, Virginia.\\\\u00a0Of course, Jones Street\\'s entire portfolio is focused on the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic multi-family homes. Still, he\\'s created a compelling slideshow that explains why the dynamics have changed in favor of these regions. It\\'s a contrarian view in an industry obsessed with the Sunbelt\\\\u00a0since Jones Street was founded in 2014.\\\\\"We came out of the investment world, not out of the real estate world, and our observation was that there was a dangerous amount of groupthink in the industry,\\\\\" Frazier told Insider.According to Frazier, one of the biggest reasons for turning north is the impending \\\\\"supply glut,\\\\\" or fears that a rush of multifamily construction \\\\\"could flip the script on the supply and demand imbalance,\\\\\" which threatens to lower rental income. According to Jones Street\\'s analysis, \\\\\"this dynamic is specific to Southeast and Sunbelt markets,\\\\\" not the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.\\\\\"Over the next four years, the number of multifamily units delivered in the NeMA is projected to average 1.4% of total supply, which is less than historical averages and less than the 2.2% expected in the Southeast and Sunbelt markets,\\\\\" the company wrote in a recent note to investors, a copy of which was obtained by Insider.\\\\u00a0What\\'s more, supply in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions isn\\'t going to surge suddenly, thanks to higher building costs and bureaucratic government control over zoning.\\\\\"The current supply and demand imbalance is not likely to be remedied soon,\\\\\" the company said in the report. Indeed, Jones Street estimates that if the pace of new housing delivery doubled relative to historical averages, \\\\\"it would still take 20 years to find supply and demand equilibrium.\\\\\"With $440 billion in multifamily loans coming due by the end of 2024 and many operators underwater on their investments, Jones Street is ready to pounce on the opportunities.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"This really substantial wave of loan maturities doesn\\'t necessarily mean there\\'s going to be blood in the streets and a lot of distress, but it certainly will create more deal flow,\\\\\" Frazier said.Frazier walked Insider through a Jones Street whitepaper that outlined this thesis and shared some charts that his investor relations team has created to show why the company is focused on smaller markets in the Northeast and Midatlantic, where the fundamentals are good, but investment demand, and therefore pricing, is lower, including Manchester, New Hampshire, Boston, Massachusetts, Portland, Maine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Richmond, Virginia.\", \"label\": \"Real Estate, BI Prime, Finance, Markets, Real Estate Investing\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-place-to-buy-multi-family-homes-rental-properties-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Inside JPMorgan\\'s Plan to Woo Startups After the Fall of SVB and First Republic\", \"date\": \"2023-09-28 13:47:01+00:00\", \"content\": \"The March implosion of Silicon Valley Bank created a\\\\u00a0banking\\\\u00a0vacuum in the startup world.JPMorgan is racing to fill it.So far this year, the Wall Street bank has doubled the head count of its commercial-banking unit dedicated to early-stage companies to more than 400 bankers. This group, dubbed the innovation economy team, has expanded to Beijing, Frankfurt, London, Stockholm, Sydney, Tel Aviv, and Zurich with more than 40 overseas hires.\\\\u00a0Many of the senior hires, both overseas and domestic, came from the ranks of SVB, including the division\\'s new cohead, John China, a 27-year veteran based in San Francisco who joined JPMorgan in July. New York-based Melissa Smith, who has led the innovation economy business since its inception in 2016, told Insider that her co-leader was hired to build trust in Silicon Valley.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"It became very clear to us in that March to April timeframe that having a senior West Coast presence that was a known commodity in the VC ecosystem was very important,\\\\\" said Smith, who also oversees the specialized industries group that includes the innovation-economy unit. \\\\\"We all recognize there is a bit of a void since the events of March, and we have the winning hand to fill that.\\\\\"This window of opportunity, however, comes at a grim time for startups. In the second quarter of 2023, venture-capital-backed companies in the US raised 48% less year-over-year, and their median valuations have fallen across nearly all stages, according to PitchBook. But Smith is \\\\\"cautiously optimistic\\\\\" with signs of green shoots in capital markets. She told Insider that this is the right moment to invest in serving startups and illustrate the advantages of working with a megabank.\\\\\"I think JPMorgan has often been viewed as the port in the storm,\\\\\" she said.The innovation-economy team was formed to attract middle-market startups and retain them until they grew large enough to need the services of JPMorgan\\'s investment bank. Within the commercial bank, it caters to small and midsize companies with services including credit, financing, treasury and payments, and international banking. JPMorgan declined to specify the unit\\'s revenue.\\\\u00a0Scooping up SVB employees is a well-trodden playbook for the innovation-economy team. In 2019, the group poached four executives from SVB to work with venture capital funds and their portfolio companies. Two years after that, JPMorgan hired another four alumni.The division was preparing to expand before SVB\\'s downfall, Smith told Insider. But these plans were accelerated by the collapse as customers fled to JPMorgan from SVB as well as First Republic, which JPMorgan now owns. Both banks were beloved by Bay Area startups and high-net-worth individuals.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"We had a decent influx of clients coming our way, so we needed to make sure we had the resources in place, whether that be in the US or in other countries, to serve those clients that had come knocking at our door,\\\\\" she said.Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\\'s chief executive, has openly acknowledged the influence of both banks. \\\\\"We\\'re building what we call the innovation economy to do a better job, and what First Republic did and Silicon Valley Bank was a big lesson to us, how they cover those clients,\\\\\" he said of the growth efforts at a recent conference.SVB had a particularly strong presence in Israel, and JPMorgan brought back Darya Fuks, an ex-JPMorgan banker who left for software company Wix, to lead a team of 10 former SVB bankers in Tel Aviv in June. First Republic also served emerging venture capital\\\\u00a0firms, an untapped client segment for JPMorgan\\'s commercial bank.The unit\\'s coverage spans life sciences, healthcare, information technology, climate tech, and e-commerce. The purpose behind building out these verticals and expanding geographically is to demonstrate to small startups that they wouldn\\'t get lost in the shuffle at the giant bank.In some aspects, the breakdown of SVB strengthened JPMorgan\\'s appeal to tech upstarts that had previously eschewed too-big-to-fail banks, Smith said.After a rush of hiring this year, Smith expects hiring to slow down in the near term, though JPMorgan has plans to hire innovation-economy bankers in Beijing.The unit\\'s customers have relatively simple needs when it comes to accounting and treasury services, but their needs have shifted in this turbulent market, Smith said.With interest-rate hikes, startups are concerned about getting the most yield on unused cash from fundraises, which wasn\\'t an issue in a zero-interest rate environment, she said.The funding crunch has given JPMorgan a chance to tout Capital Connect, a digital platform for private companies to find investors and vice versa, which was launched in October. The bank also acquired fintech Aumni in March and is integrating its benchmarking term sheet data into Capital Connect\\\\u00a0Bankers are also having tough conversations with clients who are trying to raise funds and facing unattractive valuations.\\\\\"I think that\\'s been a huge focus area, particularly in a constrained capital environment,\\\\\" she said, \\\\\"having that conversation with founders around when is the right time to raise the next round of capital, and helping them kind of digest or get over the hump of a down round or just a valuation that\\'s not as attractive as they would have seen in 2021.\\\\\"\", \"label\": \"Finance, BI Prime, JPMorgan, Startups, Venture Capital, Banking, Wall Street, Finance\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-startups-commercial-bank-svb-first-republic-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"\\\\\"Dumb Money\\\\\" Movie Review Based on GameStop Meme-Stock Trading Saga\", \"date\": \"2023-09-29 16:37:52+00:00\", \"content\": \"When individual investors sent shares of so-called meme stocks skyrocketing in early 2021, putting billion-dollar hedge funds on their heels, one thing seemed obvious: This would make a helluva movie.\\\\u00a0More than two years later, we get to see for ourselves.\\\\\"Dumb Money,\\\\\" which opens for a wide release today, navigates the lead-up, peak, and aftermath of the GameStop short-squeeze, which led short-sellers to lose billions of dollars.Full disclosure: I was critical of how the movie was cast.

The depiction of hedge fund managers Ken Griffin (Nick Offerman), Steve Cohen (Vincent D\\'Onofrio), and Gabe Plotkin (Seth Rogen), whose firm\\'s GameStop short position put it in Reddit traders\\' crosshairs, came across as too over-the-top and cartoonish.\\\\u00a0That\\'s not a defense of them.

A 2023 survey found that 82% of Americans worry about the impact of inflation. And two in three adults fear the next recession is just months away.In the face of financial uncertainty, it\\'s always wise to reexamine your plan for saving. What steps can you take to shore up against the unknown? How can you maximize your savings and your peace of mind?Saving more money means widening the gap between your income and your expenses.Knowing those numbers is the first step. Try tracking money in and money out for at least one month. Then, use what you\\'ve learned to create a strategic plan for your finances \\\\u2014 a simple but powerful budget.\\\\u00a0Next, get creative in reducing those expenses:Two amazing allies when it comes to saving are time and compound interest.When you leave money in an account that offers compound interest, you reap savings exponentially over time. What starts as a few dollars of interest transforms over the years into hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.Savings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs are ideal tools for reaping compound interest on short-term savings. Consider these accounts for money used for paying bills, traveling next summer, or stashing for a rainy day.\\\\\"The most important first step is moving whatever funds you have to save to a separate account to avoid the temptation of spending unnecessarily. Beyond that, it often comes down to a tradeoff between flexibility and earning the highest guaranteed rates possible,\\\\\" said Jaspreet Chawla, senior vice president of savings products at Navy Federal Credit Union.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"Your standard savings account will generally have a lower rate than a money market account but will allow more options for utility. Certificates, particularly in the 3-month to 18-month range in today\\'s environment, give a higher guaranteed return but lack the option for immediate access without penalty.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0Longer-term savings goals might include a college fund for your child or your own retirement savings. For these goals, consider taking on more risk in exchange for higher rates of return with specialized investment accounts. For college, try a 529 Plan or Coverdell ESA. For retirement, explore 401(k) plans, IRAs, Roth IRAs, and dedicated accounts for the self-employed.\\\\\"I always recommend meeting with a financial advisor at your bank or credit union because they can help you evaluate the possible solutions to meet your financial needs,\\\\\" Chawla added.At some point, an unforeseen expense will come your way. It may be a necessary repair for your home or car, a medical bill, or even a lost job.Facing that event without cash on hand triggers two more problems you definitely don\\'t need \\\\u2014 added stress and the possibility of being forced into costly debt.Fortunately, an emergency fund can carry you smoothly over many financial bumps. And you can start building yours quickly:People often overlook the high cost of interest payments made every month on debt. However, reducing or eliminating those payments frees up cash for extra savings.First, look at every account on which you carry a balance. This may include credit cards, personal loans, car loans, a mortgage, and student loans.Next, examine your interest rates. Are they fixed at a low rate? Variable and subject to climb? Fixed at a rate that\\'s costing you dearly?Assess your options for the debts with the highest interest rates:If you\\'re a current or retired service member \\\\u2014 or if you\\'re part of a military family \\\\u2014 there are a variety of exclusive savings that may be available to you:\\\\\"While points and cash back are the primary benefits of using a credit card, many cards have other often overlooked and underused benefits that can save you time and money,\\\\\" says Russell Nelson, manager of the credit card products acquisition team at Navy Federal Credit Union.\\\\\"For example, maximize benefits by shopping through your card issuer\\'s online shopping portal. By doing so, you can earn extra rewards beyond what you\\'d get for purchasing in-store or directly from a retailer\\'s website.\\\\\"No one knows for sure what the economic landscape will look like next year or even next month.

Another $25 million will go toward building up law enforcement on the island, according to the statement.As part of the settlement announced Tuesday, the bank is also paying an additional $20 million in fees for the US Virgin Islands\\' attorneys, from the firm Motley Rice LLC.The funds come on top of the $290 million JPMorgan Chase has already agreed to settle a separate class-action lawsuit brought by Epstein victims, to fund a compensation program.According to the statement, JPMorgan has also settled legal claims with Jes Staley, the former CEO of Barclays who stepped down in 2021 following revelations about his relationship with Epstein. During an earlier time as a JPMorgan executive, Staley kept close ties with Epstein, exchanging over 1,000 emails, including during a period when Epstein was incarcerated for soliciting sex with a minor.JPMorgan had sued Staley, alleging he was solely responsible for any liability from the US Virgin Islands\\' lawsuit \\\\u2014 a claim Staley had denied.The settlement arrived hours before lawyers for Staley and JPMorgan were scheduled to argue in a Manhattan federal court over the scope of a trial, which a judge set for October. The terms of the settlement with Staley were not disclosed.The US Virgin Islands had claimed that JPMorgan \\\\\"pulled the levers\\\\\" of Epstein\\'s sex-trafficking operation by running his bank accounts and turning a blind eye to payments that should have raised alarms within the institution. At least 20 of his victims were paid $1 million through his accounts managed by JPMorgan, the government alleged.In pretrial court filings, JPMorgan claimed the US Virgin Islands government was essentially guilty of the same practices. Local politicians, it claimed, had received donations from Epstein and allowed the pedophile to run rampant as law enforcement turned away from red flags. Epstein owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands, which were sold by his estate earlier this year to billionaire Stephen Deckoff for $60 million.The lawsuits caused turmoil in the US Virgin Islands when they were filed last December. Shortly after they were fired, the territory\\'s governor ousted Denise George, the previous attorney general, who brought the JPMorgan case.In a statement, US Virgin Islands Attorney General Ariel M. Smith said he was looking forward to \\\\\"building a new relationship with JPMorgan.\\\\\" The bank would inform law enforcement when customers are involved in human trafficking and terminate their accounts, he said.\\\\\"This settlement is an historic victory for survivors and for state enforcement, and it should sound the alarm on Wall Street about banks\\' responsibilities under the law to detect and prevent human trafficking,\\\\\" Smith said. \\\\\"Our Department of Justice tirelessly pursued this enforcement action to make it substantially harder for traffickers to finance their crimes in the future, and we are confident this settlement will help achieve that goal.\\\\\"In a separate statement in response, JPMorgan spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank had not introduced any new policies. It was \\\\\"committed to previous and ongoing efforts to fight human trafficking\\\\\" through its anti-money laundering program.\\\\\"There are no new commitments. Our controls, compliance, risk, and other functions are always improving, and we are continually investing to become even better,\\\\\" Wexler said. \\\\\"We have always worked closely with law enforcement to help combat human trafficking, and we will continue to look for ways to invest in advancing this important mission.\\\\\"The additional funds from JPMorgan, Wexler said, will help the US Virgin Islands improve its own enforcement practices, she said.\\\\\"We are pleased that the USVI will use settlement proceeds to enhance the infrastructure and capabilities of their law enforcement to prevent and combat human trafficking and other crimes in their territories,\\\\\" she said.Epstein killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019. His acquaintance Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of trafficking girls to him for sex in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence.Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million to settle a similar class action lawsuit brought by Epstein\\'s victims, also alleging the financial institution facilitated his sex trafficking. Epstein\\'s estate, following the financier\\'s death, paid out $125 million to his victims.This story has been updated.\", \"label\": \"News, Finance, Politics, Jeffrey Epstein\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/jp-morgan-settles-virgin-islands-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-suit-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Why Gen Z in the UK Are Struggling More Than Any Generation Before Them\", \"date\": \"2023-09-26 12:29:37+00:00\", \"content\": \"I\\'ve been working since I was barely in my teens, first with a morning paper route then part-time in retail during my studies.I\\'m three years older than my parents were when they bought their first house in 1995 at the age of 21.I make on average \\\\u00a33,000 a month as a freelance writer, roughly \\\\u00a3500 above the monthly median wage in my area, according to PayScale, and still, the prospect of buying a house with my partner feels completely unachievable.I was the first in my family to go to university and consequently racked up almost \\\\u00a365,000, or around $80,000, in student-loan debt.To attend university, I took out both tuition fees and maintenance loans \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0the maintenance loan paid for my accommodation but little else. I worked part-time in retail and as a freelance writer during my studies.After graduating in 2020, I freelanced full time while living on my own. England was in and out of lockdown and I managed to save \\\\u00a35,000 thanks to a lack of expenses aside from rent and utilities.I started my master\\'s degree in 2021 and took out another student loan. It covered my tuition fees but not all of my accommodation, so I had to dip into the money I\\'d saved the previous year.Between both degrees, as of September 11, I owe \\\\u00a364,834.46 in student loans, with an interest rate of 7.3%. Before June, the interest rate was 12%, but the government has reduced it due to the cost-of-living crisis.For British students in the UK, tuition fees are currently capped at \\\\u00a39,250 a year. In 2006, tuition at a UK university cost an average of \\\\u00a33,000 a year, according to the House of Commons Library. In 1998, when tuition fees were first introduced, I\\'d have been paying \\\\u00a31,000. Tuition prices have risen far beyond general inflation.The UK has been in a cost-of-living crisis since 2021. The crisis is the fall of disposable incomes in the UK as a result of the national and global rise in inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and the war in Ukraine.While everyone will be affected to some degree, young people \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0who are more likely to have lower incomes and less savings \\\\u2014 are among the most affected.As a freelancer, the money I make each month can fluctuate, but I always make enough to look after my rent, bills, and other expenses.Generally, I can expect to make around \\\\u00a33,000 a month, before taxes. I currently pay around \\\\u00a31,000, or about $1,250, in rent and utilities a month.I\\'m fortunate to be in a relatively decent financial situation, but I still find it impossible to imagine a real future for myself \\\\u2014 one in which I own a house and a car, have a comfortable standard of living, and the thought of retiring before the age of 75 isn\\'t a pipe dream.When my parents had me in 1999 they were able to raise a family in a house they already owned.My parents said they never had it easy, but they\\'ve acknowledged they wouldn\\'t have had the same security or be able to get on the property ladder now.They\\'ve had to work hard over the years, but it feels as though their hard work has been rewarded in a way that the hard work of my generation isn\\'t.In 2022, nearly half of young people in the UK surveyed by Deloitte reported spending their entire monthly salary on living costs. This makes saving money for retirement or for a home seem nearly impossible.As of June 2023, the average house price in Bath and North East Somerset, where I live, was \\\\u00a3435,313, up 2.8% from last year, according to the UK House Price Index.Homes are only getting more expensive \\\\u2014 and quickly. Go back a decade, to 2013, and the average house price in this area was \\\\u00a3250,911. In 2003, the average price was \\\\u00a3180,278.The average house price in 1995, when my parents moved in together, was around \\\\u00a356,000. According to the Bank of England\\'s Inflation Calculator, something that cost \\\\u00a310 in 1995 would cost \\\\u00a319.48 in July 2023, an increase of 94.8%.However, if you compare the average house price in 1995 to the average house price in the UK in June 2023 \\\\u2014 \\\\u00a3287,456 \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0it\\'s increased by more than 413%.Meanwhile, median weekly earnings are roughly \\\\u00a3575 according to PayScale, so I\\'m earning over the average for my area.When my girlfriend and I talk about moving in together in a couple of years, we find the thought of buying a property almost hilarious.My friends and I are resigned to long-term renting, even those of us who have the degrees and qualifications our parents didn\\'t.I chose to go to university and rack up student debt, and I could stop going out to socialize to save more money \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0but it\\'s not feasible to expect all young people to stop living their lives to save.Young people are struggling financially not because they get a latte on their way to work or meet their friends for a drink on the weekend. They\\'re struggling because\\\\u00a0it\\'s simply more difficult to get started as an adult in life now.It\\'s more difficult to get onto the property ladder and to save and plan for the future, whether you buy the occasional small treat to help you through or not.\", \"label\": \"Opinion, Finance, gen z\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gen-z-financially-struggling-living-in-england-uk-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"AI Study With Consultants Shows Impact on Office Workers\", \"date\": \"2023-09-25 14:47:23+00:00\", \"content\": \"When I think of white collar workers, I think first of consultants.Armed with MBAs and case studies, these consultants parachute into the biggest companies in the world to find efficiencies, sharpen strategy, and justify tough decisions.There\\'s been a lot of talk recently around how AI might impact these kinds of so-called knowledge workers.

The pitch session is meant to push them out of their comfort zone, Harry Schwefel, Point72\\'s co-chief investment officer, told Insider.They ask questions like, \\\\\"How are you going to get there? What are the building blocks?\\\\\" Schwefel said. \\\\\"It creates a great forum for Steve to dig into those building blocks to give his own view on things he\\'s seen work and things that haven\\'t worked.\\\\\"The exercise is part of Point72\\'s program for emerging long/short equity investors, LaunchPoint. It takes on internal and external senior analysts looking to take the next step and run their own book.\\\\u00a0It\\'s a chance for Cohen to share his wisdom and draw on his nearly 40 years of experience. The billionaire opened Point72 in 2014 as a family office after his previous firm, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to securities fraud tied to allegations of systemic insider trading.\\\\u00a0Point72 is a pioneer in developing investor talent; the multi-manager has been running LaunchPoint, previously known as Nines, since 2012. It also runs the Point72 Academy, a 10-month boot camp for college graduates looking to become investment analysts.LaunchPoint is an incubator, a training ground for promising analysts to build a team and test their strategies through mock portfolios with the support of Jon Weiner, the head of LaunchPoint and a longtime healthcare PM, and his team. They remain in the program for the first year they manage real client money. Point72 declined to disclose how much money these PMs are seeded with.A pipeline of new managers is handy in times like these, when the world\\'s biggest hedge fund managers are deploying more money and perks to hire top traders. To find long/short talent\\\\u2014 investors that own some stocks in hopes their prices will rise and others short, hoping their prices will fall\\\\u2014 it\\'s becoming increasingly difficult.\\\\\"In my day to day, a good long/short manager is an endangered species,\\\\\" said John Pierson, head of portfolio manager search firm P2 Investments. \\\\\"Not that they\\'re going away, but to survive in a market-neutral mode, you have to learn to time the market\\\\u2014 to tilt\\\\u2014 it\\'s a very hard thing to be good at. And if you\\'re good, they\\'re going to move heaven and earth to get you on their side.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0And just as Cohen has flexed his billions to build up the roster for his New York Mets, Point72 is involved in the current hedge fund hiring spree.\\\\\"We believe that it\\'s important to be incredibly active in the external talent market, but also to not leave things to chance, not leave things to the ebbing and flowing of supply and demand and cyclicality and instead develop it ourselves,\\' Schwefel said.If the hunt for hedge fund talent resembles bidding wars for star athletes, then Point72\\'s LaunchPoint is its feeder team.\\\\u00a0In a press conference after buying the New York Mets in 2020, Cohen said: \\\\\"We\\'re going to build a process that produces great teams year in and year out. You build champions. You don\\'t buy them.\\\\\"Weiner said: \\\\\"We\\'re taking the same approach here, which is we\\'re not just buying PMs, we\\'re building them internally.\\\\\"And they\\'ve benefited from setting investors up in-house. More than 70 long/short managers have launched through LaunchPoint since it started in 2012, and 75% of those are still at Point72. They make up 50% of the firm\\'s 100 long/short managers. The firm has about 175 PMs globally.Becoming a PM at a multi-manager like Point72 can be daunting: You\\'re handed a significant level of autonomy to run your team and make investment decisions. There are often specific risk parameters and a set amount their strategy can lose before getting the ax.\\\\u00a0For Point72, LaunchPoint was created with the idea that it can take two to three years to figure out how to be a PM.\\\\\"Sometimes the mistakes happen before they\\'ve even launched capital because of how Jon\\'s team runs their process,\\\\\" Schwefel said. \\\\\"Sometimes it happens after they\\'ve launched, but we\\'re not subjecting them to binary outcomes with drawdowns in those early years because they\\'re figuring it out.\\\\\"Point72 helps PMs with startup costs and infrastructure builds, finding the proper research tools, and analyst talent. Weiner and his team, Nick Shivers and Ariel Herman, help facilitate the build-out of models and data, \\\\\"anything that basically gives you a nudge, helps you make decisions.\\\\\"\\\\\"We saw that preparation really influenced the long-term success of new PMs,\\\\\" Weiner said.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0The program currently has 21 candidates, but it fluctuates as people join or roll off. The candidates are typically split between Point72 senior analysts ready to take the plunge and senior analysts from single-manager hedge funds or their rivals who make it through the firm\\'s intricate hiring process.The candidates come forward with detailed business plans and spend months fine-tuning their investing approach with a paper book that stimulates their portfolio without putting any money at risk.\\\\u00a0There is no set time frame before they go live; Weiner said it could vary between six and 15 months. They launch once PMs have their team, infrastructure, and other necessary tools set, and they\\'ve shown signs of success.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"We don\\'t just hand the manual to new PMs and say, \\'This is how to be a PM.\\' It\\'s very customized. We\\'re underwriting their business, and we want to help it evolve,\\\\\" Weiner said.Griffin Newman, who joined Point72 from Brigade Capital Management in 2015 as an analyst, knew he wanted to evolve into a manager at the firm and made that goal known in the hiring process.After four years of working under another PM, he hit a point where he felt ready. He worked on his business plan for about eight months, getting feedback from his colleagues along the way, ahead of joining LaunchPoint.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0\\\\\"Places will use the carrot of big dollars that you can manage as a way to get it in there, which I think is just very risky,\\\\\" said Newman, referring to other multi-managers. \\\\\"I think that the benefit here as you go and do it on a paper book with people monitoring and your dollars scale up in a measured way, it just really ensures your probability of success instead of being thrown totally into the deep end.\\\\\"Newman, who started the program in 2019, took about a year to start running his book, which meant he launched during the pandemic. His focus is airplanes and aviation and the sectors that touch that, including industrials, consumers, and tech.\\\\\"The scary thing is you\\'re now in charge, and so you\\'re going into a new role where you\\'re managing money, and you have a team of analysts looking up to you to be the point person, making your own decisions when you haven\\'t done it before,\\\\\" Newman said.\\\\u00a0 \\\\\"And I got to try that into a pandemic, a travel aviation person.\\\\\"He was lucky to be able to pick up the phone and call Weiner and other PMs for guidance. He said he still hears Weiner in his head \\\\\"every single day\\\\\" regarding lessons he learned during the program.\\\\\"They\\'re phenomenal at finding your weaknesses or areas that you could be adjusting,\\\\\" he said.Weiner was a day-one employee at SAC Advisors. He spent over 25 years as a healthcare PM and personally developed several analysts who went on to run their own money.In 2019, he decided to hand over his team to one of those analysts, Ryan Wilder, who recently left the firm to launch his own healthcare fund, according to Bloomberg.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"It was my time to move on and do something else,\\\\\" Weiner said. \\\\\"And this was just a great next step for me where I could still be part of a firm I grew up in and give back and help the next generation of talent.\\\\\"Weiner took over in 2020 and rebranded the program from Nines \\\\u2014 a 10 would mean a person is entirely ready to be a PM \\\\u2014 to LaunchPoint to reflect better what it did.\\\\u00a0Including the annual goal pitching session with Cohen\\\\u2014 which is typically followed by a dinner with him, Weiner has made mentorship core to what he does, from setting up coffees with PMs and candidates in the same sectors to inviting managers to host fireside chats where they talk about their struggles when starting out.\\\\u00a0One such common struggle is team management. Weiner and his team work on communication and encourage conversations with PMs who had issues with their team early on.\\\\\"A lot of the PMs go to a place of vulnerability where they really share some of the real challenges that they had,\\\\\" Weiner said. \\\\\"The hope is really that our new PMs can learn from them, and hopefully avoid them, but if they encounter them, they realize, \\'hey, this is not just unique to me.\\'\\\\\"\", \"label\": \"Finance, BI Prime, Hedge Funds, Trading, Wall Street\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/point72-launchpoint-hedge-fund-steve-cohen-emerging-manager-training-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Citadel Securities in Legal Battle With 2 Ex-Staff Who Started Crypto Firm\", \"date\": \"2023-09-24 09:55:18+00:00\", \"content\": \"Ken Griffin has made some scathing comments about cryptocurrencies in recent years.The billionaire founder of the hedge fund Citadel and Citadel Securities, the market-making firm based in Miami, said in October 2021 that due to the \\\\\"lack of regulatory certainty around cryptocurrency, we just aren\\'t involved today.\\\\\" He added: \\\\\"I just don\\'t want to take on the regulatory risk in this regulatory void that some of my contemporaries are ready to take on.\\\\\"Griffin also described crypto as \\\\\"a jihadist call\\\\\" against the US dollar.Alex Casimo and Leonard Lancia did not share the same view of crypto.

An Emirati helped change that.As he drew attention at home as an ambitious royal in the mid-2010s, becoming defense minister before the age of 30, it was United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan who helped the Saudi prince\\'s name reverberate in the West.\\\\\"MBZ was basically telling Obama, \\'You\\'ve got to pay attention to this young prince because he will be a future king of Saudi Arabia\\' \\\\u2014 when at the time, nobody had really heard of him,\\\\\" Kristian Ulrichsen, a Middle East fellow at Rice University\\'s Baker Institute, said, referring to Sheikh Mohamed.By giving Crown Prince Mohammed credibility from Washington to London, Sheikh Mohamed, now 62, began to foster a close relationship with the future leader of the biggest economy in the Middle East.That relationship is now fraught.The stratospheric rise of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed in recent years has created a turbulent relationship between him and Sheikh Mohamed \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0a man considered by many to have been his mentor \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0as the crown prince\\'s unrelenting pursuit of glory has threatened to sow deep discord between neighboring states.How the UAE and Saudi Arabia navigate their growing tensions is crucial: The consequences of an escalating rivalry threaten to ripple far beyond the Persian Gulf.While the crown prince and the UAE president started out as close allies, the rivalry between their two nations has deep roots.In the 1950s, a three-year territorial battle known as the Buraimi dispute saw the Saudis attempt to wrestle an oil-rich oasis around the city of Al Ain into their possession, sparking furor in the UAE \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0then part of what was known as the Trucial States.In the \\'70s, when the British completed their withdrawal from the Gulf in the twilight of their empire, a settlement that established borders between the UAE and Saudi Arabia later left the Emiratis feeling cheated as a huge oil field known as Shaybah went to the Saudis.Ulrichsen said Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE\\'s founder and former president, was believed to have spent \\\\\"the rest of his life\\\\\" feeling \\\\\"he had been tricked by the Saudis\\\\\" into giving up this resource-rich area.Fast-forward to the 2000s, and battles seemed to spill into all arenas \\\\u2014 naval standoffs, disputes over a gas pipeline from Qatar, and fallout over a proposed common currency in the Gulf came to define the relationship between the two nations.It wasn\\'t until the Arab Spring that the competing nations found significant common ground.\\\\\"Both the UAE and Saudi, especially Abu Dhabi, felt that Qatar was supporting different groups, and they aligned against Qatar, and this brought them onto the same page,\\\\\" Ulrichsen said.It was only a matter of time before sparks would fly again: The two states are battling to determine which will be the region\\'s superpower.\\\\\"These are two countries increasingly eyeing each other in a hostile way for geo-economic purposes and are going to be at odds with one another on an array of issues,\\\\\" Abishur Prakash, the founder of the Geopolitical Business, an advisory firm, said.On an economic front, the UAE has had a huge head start with Dubai, which has consistently been a destination for young Saudis and others seeking jobs not available at home, as well as foreign direct investment from global businesses looking for a gateway to the Middle East.That advantage is now threatened by Vision 2030 \\\\u2014\\\\u00a0the crown prince\\'s radical transformation plan to future-proof Saudi Arabia\\'s economy by reducing its dependence on oil. Its scope is enormous.Along with \\\\\"gigaprojects\\\\\" such as The Line \\\\u2014 a 100-mile-long glass structure on the cusp of the Red Sea envisioned as a car-free, futuristic city for 9 million people \\\\u2014 Vision 2030 is targeting entertainment, hospitality, and travel as growth areas for the country.These sectors, of course, are central to the UAE\\'s economy, making Saudi Arabia\\'s focus on them a direct competitive threat.\\\\\"You cannot have a business hub in two neighboring countries in such close proximity,\\\\\" Abdullah Alaoudh, the Saudi director at the Freedom Initiative, a US human-rights organization, said. \\\\\"Sometimes their influence or their interests, actually, do not see eye to eye.\\\\\"Recent developments have made this direct competition clearer than ever. In March, Saudi Arabia unveiled Riyadh Air, a new airline serving as an alternative to the UAE\\'s Emirates and Etihad Airways.In 2021, the Saudi Public Investment Fund completed its $400 million takeover of Newcastle United FC, giving it ownership of a sports club that would directly compete in the English Premier League against the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.Saudi Arabia is also upping the ante as it prepares to introduce regulations that go into effect on January 1 barring foreign companies from operating in the country unless their regional headquarters is also there. Several firms have their bases in the UAE.\\\\\"A move like that fundamentally redesigns the relationship between the UAE and Saudi Arabia,\\\\\" Prakash said. \\\\\"You\\'re telling the world to pick sides. If you want to do business with Saudi Arabia or Saudi state-owned entities, you\\'ve got to base your regional HQ in Saudi Arabia.\\\\\"Experts say Crown Prince Mohammed\\'s full-blooded political ambitions have made relations between the UAE and Saudi Arabia a real high-wire act, too.The anti-corruption purge that turned Riyadh\\'s Ritz Carlton into a prison for elite Saudis targeted by the crown prince in 2017 sparked alarm as the consequences of unbridled ambition from the leader presented a huge uncertainty.The murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 \\\\u2014 which an intelligence report released by the Biden administration in 2021 concluded had been approved by the Saudi crown prince \\\\u2014 presented a similar uncertainty.\\\\\"I think there was a concern that MBS seemed to have no limits over his actions,\\\\\" the Baker Institute\\'s Ulrichsen said. \\\\\"It was almost a wake-up call to some people in Abu Dhabi, like, \\'What\\'s next?\\'\\\\\"The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been sparring well beyond their own borders, too. A critical flash point has been Yemen, where the UAE formed a part of the Saudi-led intervention into the country torn by civil war in March 2015. The two are now on opposing sides.As the war has descended into a full-blown humanitarian crisis following periods of intense airstrikes and targeting of Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the Saudis have sided with the Yemeni government, while the UAE has backed an opposing secessionist group in the south.\\\\\"For Saudi Arabia, this is a very dangerous game,\\\\\" Alaoudh said. \\\\\"Saudi Arabia sees the separation project in Yemen as a way to let the Houthis control the north and therefore have a more-threatening border at the south of Saudi Arabia.\\\\\"How far the rivalry between the two nations goes largely depends on Saudi Arabia\\'s actions. While a Qatar-style blockade is unlikely, experts told Insider, Saudi Arabia may look to push the UAE by getting the upper hand economically.Both are members of the oil cartel OPEC+ but have opposite stances on oil production. Saudi Arabia is seeking to reduce production as crude nears $100 a barrel; the UAE said in July it wouldn\\'t make further voluntary production cuts.Prakash added that much of this now came down to the crown prince\\'s ability to deliver on the central promises of Vision 2030.\\\\\"Is Saudi Arabia posing a threat today to the UAE? No, because the projects Saudi Arabia is working on are not finished yet,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"The Line is an incredible project, but once it\\'s built, will people come? That\\'s the million-dollar question.\\\\\"Evidence also suggests some promises may not be kept. During a press conference in 2016, the same year the Vision 2030 project was announced, the crown prince made the bold claim that Saudi Arabia \\\\\"can live without oil\\\\\" by 2020.Three years have passed, and the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco generated record profits of $161 billion in 2022, with Saudi Arabia\\'s role as the world\\'s top oil exporter boosted by the Ukraine war.\\\\\"We\\'re almost going to finish the year 2023, and Saudi Arabia is more dependent on oil than ever,\\\\\" Alaoudh said.The foreign investment needed for Vision 2030 has also been slow to arrive. Figures published in July by the United Nations showed that Saudi Arabia\\'s foreign direct investment dropped almost 60% to $7.9 billion last year, but the figure for the UAE rose by 10% to $23 billion.Ulrichsen said this reflected the fallout from the Ritz Carlton siege, which spooked overseas investors: \\\\\"Foreign-investment levels collapsed after that, partly because investors were thinking, \\'Well what happens if our business partner suddenly gets detained?\\'\\\\\"That said, there is still a possibility of Saudi Arabia pulling off a generational transformation. What that could mean for the UAE, Prakash said, is \\\\\"more competition, more clashing.\\\\\"\", \"label\": \"Economy, Finance, Saudi Arabia\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-vs-uae-middle-east-economic-power-supremacy-dubai-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"The IRS Will Know If You Made Big Money Reselling Your Concert Tickets\", \"date\": \"2023-09-24 08:35:46+00:00\", \"content\": \"A new law will make it harder for people to make money reselling concert tickets online.The law, which was introduced as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will require sites such as StubHub and Ticketmaster to hand over the data of all sellers who make more than $600 to the IRS.Those sellers will then be required to fill out a 1099-K form, which is \\\\\"a report of payments you got during the year,\\\\\" and their earnings will be subjected to tax income deductions.Previously, the threshold needed before stating taxable income on ticket resale sites was far higher \\\\u2014 a user needed to have received over $20,000 in revenue and have more than 200 transactions, The Wall Street Journal reported.But this year the topic of ticket resales has made headlines, as prices for big events surged.Tickets to see MLS side Inter Miami CF, for example, rose from an average of $30 to $255 online as fans rushed to see the team\\'s new superstar Lionel Messi.The average price for a Beyonc\\\\u00e9 concert ticket averaged $380, while fans wanting to see Harry Styles live needed to fork out an average of $400, the Journal reported.The resale of Taylor Swift\\'s Eras Tour tickets has caused the most commotion, as hugely inflated prices, fake ticket sales, and site crashes angered her fanbase.The average face-value price of a ticket for the tour is $254, Fortune reported.

Garg also said the money would give the company breathing room to wait out the rough market, and predicted a refinancing boom once interest rates fall.The mortgage industry has been hit hard by rising rates, leading to revenue declines and layoffs across the industry.

But let\\'s face it, many of the tasks junior bankers spend their time on could very well be done by a robot.Talk to any entry-level investment banker and they will tell you their day is full of tedious chores: Adding corporate logos to slideshows, fixing a messy million-row Excel sheet to look neat, and gathering information on a company or industry and summarizing it into a document.\\\\\"A lot of the work analysts do is very mundane. You\\'re doing random Excel stuff or editing a deck or putting logos on a Powerpoint,\\\\\" said a first-year investment banking analyst who works on tech deals. \\\\\"As a junior banker you don\\'t critically think. You just do as you\\'re told.\\\\\"With artificial intelligence progressing by leaps and bounds, how will it impact the job of the junior banker? Insider spoke to six finance professionals, including an entry-level banker. We learned that AI could be good for junior financiers, making their jobs less tedious and maybe even improving their notoriously grueling schedules. But it could also mean firms will require fewer analysts on staff, making an already competitive industry even fiercer, and causing them to raise the bar when it comes to the skills required to break into the field.To some extent, it\\'s happening already. Deutsche Bank, for example, has begun testing out generative AI pilots, and Insider spoke to Tamara Bitticks, one of the execs involved in the project, to get her insights into how it\\'s going and what the future holds. She said it\\'s already helping junior bankers get their jobs done faster.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0Whether you think about AI, it\\'s advancing fast and will have major implications for our lives and work. Here\\'s what it could mean for people who start off on the lowest rungs of the investment banking career ladder.According to a recent study by consulting firm Deloitte, generative AI will unleash \\\\\"a new era of productivity\\\\\" for investment banking, boosting the productivity of front-office workers by as much as 35% by 2026, which could translate to additional revenue of at least $3 million per employee.\\\\u00a0It also has the potential to improve the lives of junior bankers, who work long hours, sometimes upwards of 100 hours a week. Junior bankers can use the tech for a range of tasks, like creating pitch books, industry reports, and performance summaries, according to the Deloitte study. They can also use it to help generate deal structures, peer analysis, and term sheets.\\\\u00a0Industry insiders agree.\\\\\"It could be a good thing for banking if there are some parts that are more automated because it\\'ll get rid of some of the work that takes hours and hours for some of these junior guys to go through,\\\\\" said a Wall Street recruiter who specializes in placements in investment banking.\\\\\"It could be good for the hours,\\\\\" added the first-year analyst. Both the analyst and the recruiter asked to remain anonymous because they weren\\'t authorized by their companies to speak to the press.Over at Deutsche Bank, executives like Bitticks are seeing the benefits firsthand. The bank has been running dozens of generative AI pilots and hiring hundreds of engineers to transform how its employees work across the firm. Some of the pilots aim to improve time-consuming and mundane tasks carried out by juniors in the corporate bank, which serves Deutsche\\'s institutional clients, financial services firms, and investors.One tool set to launch at the beginning of the year will use AI to generate reports senior bankers need to prepare for client meetings, Bitticks said. Making one of these reports \\\\u2014 which brief the bankers on leadership changes, company performance, and relevant industry trends \\\\u2014 usually takes a team of junior bankers a day or two to produce, said Bitticks, vice chair in Deutsche\\'s corporate bank.\\\\u00a0The new tool will allow these reports to be created in just a few keystrokes.The technology will pave the way for \\\\\"a new way of being a banker,\\\\\" Bitticks said, and enable juniors to focus on building up more analytical skills and soft skills.\\\\\"What I struggle with our juniors a lot of times is they\\'re gathering the information, and they\\'re so consumed with the gathering that they don\\'t think about the analyzing,\\\\\" Bitticks told Insider in an interview at the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco last month.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"AI gives them these great tools to know what all the data is behind the scenes and to come in fully up to speed on what the client\\'s doing and allows them to worry about the engagement itself instead of putting all the data together,\\\\\" Bitticks said.\\\\u00a0The recruiter echoed that sentiment, saying AI could allow analysts to do \\\\\"more of the associate level work in the future.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0Peter Torrente, a partner at KPMG working with financial services firms, agreed that AI may require future generations of junior bankers to hone their analytical skills and become better at understanding data and extracting insights.\\\\\"It will allow junior bankers to operate at a higher level with that first pass of analysis being prepared by the technology,\\\\\" said Torrente. But it will also likely give bankers larger datasets to work with \\\\u2014 whether it\\'s a broader peer analysis or data that goes further back in time \\\\u2014 which will lead to more investigating and analysis on behalf of the banker, he added.The skills required to become a Wall Street trader or investment banker are also changing in other ways, said Bogdan Tudose of Training the Street (TTS), which preps up-and-coming finance and business students and new hires at client firms like Blackstone, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley.\\\\\"Coding is becoming an essential skill for all bankers and financial analysts to have,\\\\\" explained Tudose. \\\\\"They don\\'t need to be full-on computer scientists or engineers; however, they need to know some of the fundamentals so they can automate some of their processes and also deal with large data. In this day and age, some of the data sets our PE and bank clients are dealing with are too large to even open up in Excel.\\\\\"While AI is expected to add to this burden, it could also help people acquire new skills faster. For example, Tudose\\'s students are using tools like ChatGPT to dramatically reduce the time it takes them to produce code to automate a task.In the past, a financial analyst might spend two to three hours creating the code \\\\\"by first googling or reading forums, copying someone else\\'s code, and then having to modify it for their own use case,\\\\\" said Tudose. \\\\\"Now, with tools such as ChatGPT, as long as you provide it the correct prompt, they can get some initial draft code in a matter of seconds to get them started.\\\\\"The proliferation of generative AI could also have its downsides. By turning over more of the mundane tasks to automation, AI also threatens to make the uber-competitive industry even harder to break into. The fewer tasks there are to be done by humans, the fewer junior workers firms will need.\\\\\"In the future maybe instead of 10 analysts, you only need five,\\\\\" said the first-year analyst.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"It\\'s good for people in the industry. I guess it\\'s bad for the people trying to break into the industry,\\\\\" the analyst added. \\\\\"There are going to be less roles, so it will be hyper competitive.\\\\\"Tudose of Training the Street says he\\'s hearing these same concerns from some of his students. People who have already broken into the industry are excited about the technology because they see it improving their workflow. New hires are more worried about generative AI replacing them, Tudose said.\\\\u00a0But he warned against buying too heavily into doomsday predictions. \\\\\"Generative AI \\'hallucination\\' is a real problem right now,\\\\\" he added, comparing it to the introduction of Excel, which had people predicting that accountants and financial analysts would be out of a job.\\\\\"Sure, it replaced some very low-entry jobs, but overall models have become more complex and powerful,\\\\\" Tudose said. \\\\\"Tools such as generative AI will have the same impact. They will help automate some of the mundane, repetitive tasks so that analysts can focus on more value-add analysis and apply critical thinking to their models.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0In other words,\\\\u00a0 there will always be a need for humans to check the work done by AI.\\\\\"Some of our participants joke in our classes that ChatGPT is currently a \\'glorified intern\\' who is overconfident in their answer but you still have to fix up their mistakes and double-check for any incorrect information,\\\\\" Tudose said.The recruiter agreed \\\\u2014 there will always be a need for some analyst roles, he said.\\\\\"At the end of the day, regardless of if there is a model or a presentation that was built by AI, I still think that they\\'re going to require the human touch to be behind that before showing it to the client realistically,\\\\\" said the recruiter.\\\\u00a0In addition to Deutsche Bank\\'s initiatives, Visa\\'s tech chief wants to have every employee working with AI by the end of the year; Goldman Sachs is piloting AI to help its 12,000-strong engineer workforce code more efficiently; JPMorgan has a team of about 60 academics who focus purely on researching the possibilities of AI.Though Wall Street\\'s embrace of AI is accelerating, industry insiders predict it could be many years before financial firms widely adopt it.\\\\u00a0A recent KPMG study found that 40% of financial services executives surveyed said their organization\\'s IT and digital infrastructure would limit their ability to innovate and adapt to advancements in AI. Financial firms built on legacy systems come with a price (for maintenance), leaving less money on the table to pursue new technologies, the survey found.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"Banks are moving more work to cloud environments, where they would have more flexibility and agility in adding new capabilities such as LLM models, but the process is slow,\\\\\" the KPMG report says. \\\\\"Banks can also face organizational barriers that limit their agility versus fintech startups. As a result, they may struggle to keep pace with the rapid innovation and product development cycles of cloud-native and AI-native startups, losing market share to these more agile competitors. Legacy asset managers face some of these same challenges.\\\\\"The first-year analyst told Insider that he isn\\'t very worried about AI taking his job because the finance industry is so \\\\\"slow\\\\\" that it\\'ll take a long time to see actual implementation at an industry-wide level. By the time that happens, if it does, he\\'ll be at his next gig on the buy side.The investment banking recruiter agreed.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"I don\\'t want to be naive because technology is obviously moving very quickly,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"I just don\\'t know how quickly the adoption of those things will be across all firms. Banks are such regulated environments and it probably has to go through so much regulatory discretion to really ultimately be implemented across all firms.\\\\\"\", \"label\": \"Finance, BI Prime, Careers\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ai-will-change-the-investment-banking-career-path-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Robinhood Is Cutting Jobs and Focusing on Credit Cards to Solve a Shrinking User Base, Insiders Say\", \"date\": \"2023-09-21 21:38:53+00:00\", \"content\": \"Robinhood is laying off more employees and reorganizing teams as part of a new focus on credit cards as the company tries to mitigate a shrinking user base, insiders say.In June, Robinhood announced plans to acquire no-fee credit card startup X1 for $95 million. Insiders say the company is planning to merge X1 with its Robinhood Money organization, the subsidiary focused on cash management and spending features of the app like its debit card, direct deposit, and peer-to-peer payments. Credit cards are much higher-margin products than stock-trading and generally less exposed to volatile markets.A Robinhood spokesperson confirmed after publication that Robinhood made internal changes as a result of the acquisition and laid off what the spokesperson said was a very small number of the 60 employees who joined Robinhood since the acquisition. The company is still hiring and has 200 open roles, the spokesperson said.The changes come as Robinhood tries to address a shrinking user base.

Moreover, many of them were able to buy stocks and homes at far lower prices in the past, and have enjoyed substantial appreciation in the value of their assets.McDonald\\'s X post made the point that higher rates have lifted yields on Treasury bills to more than 5%. As a result, baby boomers have the option to cash out their profits, invest in short-term government debt, and collect a solid, guaranteed return.The former Lehman Brothers trader, who wrote a book about the investment bank\\'s collapse at the start of the financial crisis, has flagged wealth disparities between generations before. He\\'s noted that at the age of 40, baby boomers had paid far less for college and their homes than millennials, a larger percentage owned homes, and they generally had higher net worths and smaller debts.\\\\\"Baby boomer party, then left the check in the lap of Millennials,\\\\\" McDonald tweeted in early 2019.

As the firm names 80 or so new partners every two years, a number close to 200 would need to leave over five years to make way for the new elite class.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"There\\'s nothing that\\'s going on in the context of partner transitions that\\'s different than any other cycle,\\\\\" Solomon said earlier this month at an investor conference. The average tenure from executives once they make partner has increased from 6.2 years to 8.3 years, Goldman says.\\\\u00a0But the departures arrive as Solomon faces a barrage of negative press, focused on his use of the corporate jet, his strategy missteps, and his temperament.An August piece in New York magazine put it bluntly, asking: \\\\\"Is David Solomon Too Big a Jerk to Run Goldman Sachs?\\\\\"\\\\u00a0To better understand their reasons for leaving, Insider set out to gather the perspectives of former partners. Interviews with six of them who have left over the past year or so, as well as with one former managing director, shed fresh light on what\\'s going on inside Goldman, and why so many are exiting.The executives worked in different parts of the bank, and each had their own motivation for leaving. They\\'ve since moved to smaller rivals or to clients, or are keeping their next step under wraps.\\\\u00a0There\\'s no way of fully capturing the reasons behind each and every partner\\'s departure under Solomon. But put together, the interviews highlighted a few recurring themes, including personnel decisions, pay, and strategy missteps.\\\\\"You want to suspend belief and say, I will follow these guys, but with the number of people mistakes and business-strategy mistakes that they have made, I think people have lost confidence in the plan,\\\\\" said one former partner who was referring to Solomon and Goldman\\'s president and chief operating office, John Waldron. The person, like the others, was granted anonymity to preserve their relationships at the bank and in the industry. Their identities are known to Insider.Some of those who spoke with Insider defended Solomon, pointing out that he had made a lot of changes in a short amount of time and that some turmoil was to be expected. They didn\\'t excuse his strategic mistakes but acknowledged that he felt that his mandate would modernize Goldman Sachs in a way that his predecessors didn\\'t or, perhaps, couldn\\'t.\\\\u00a0In particular, before Solomon, Goldman nurtured many fiefs and then spread the wealth from the most successful ones across the firm. Under Solomon, that model has been turned on its head in favor of delivering return-on-equity targets for investors in a way that made Goldman more like JPMorgan.Goldman\\'s lead director, Adebayo Ogunlesi, acknowledged that Goldman lost some partners \\\\\"it did not want to lose in part due to disagreements as GS began acting more like a Fortune 50 firm,\\\\\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a September 18 report after meeting with Ogunlesi and referencing the company\\'s stock ticker.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0Investors have largely supported the shift. Goldman\\'s stock has gained 94% since the end of 2018, compared with a 79% increase in the S&P 500, Devin Ryan, a JMP analyst, wrote in a September 11 report.\\\\\"We think it is also fair to criticize certain aspects of management and its decisions, including Mr. Solomon, as that comes with the territory,\\\\\" Ryan wrote. \\\\\"However, when looking back on how the firm has operated since 2019 (Mr. Solomon took the helm in late 2018), we would highlight that a lot has gone right.\\\\\"Nonetheless, the changes Solomon has made have angered many current and former employees, partners and managing directors alike, one of the people said.\\\\\"It was a multiyear process of pissing a lot of people off,\\\\\" the person said.Of the former Goldman executives that Insider interviewed, here are the most cited reasons they gave for leaving Goldman.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0One doesn\\'t get too far into a conversation with a former partner before hearing complaints about the personnel decisions made by Solomon or Waldron.\\\\u00a0According to the former partners, as well as those still at the bank who spoke with Insider, Solomon and Waldron have repeatedly elevated executives without the appropriate management experience into much larger roles, or placed people in charge of teams where they had no industry experience. In many of those cases, the handpicked executives have failed to execute on the firm\\'s strategic priorities.Solomon and Waldron have justified the appointments by saying that talented executives should be able to flourish anywhere and that an internal candidate who knows Goldman\\'s culture is preferable to an outsider.\\\\u00a0Yet the appointments have had destabilizing effects on various teams and contributed to the turmoil, some of the people said. Managers below them in the division have had to spend time on backfilling positions or calming anxieties when they could be focused on developing new business.\\\\\"That\\'s absurd,\\\\\" Tony Fratto, a Goldman spokesperson, said in an emailed statement, using abbreviations to describe the businesses of asset and wealth management and global banking and markets. \\\\\"Our AWM business is exceeding its targets and delivering record management fees and our GBM business is taking market and wallet share from peers.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0Many of the people who spoke with Insider pointed to the asset- and wealth-management division as a prime example of a unit that had suffered from Solomon\\'s unorthodox leadership choices.In September 2020, Solomon merged Goldman\\'s mutual fund and third-party alternatives business with its in-house private-equity business, known as the merchant-banking division, to create one large asset-management division. He named Eric Lane and Julian Salisbury to run the combined business. While Lane had long run one of Goldman\\'s divisions, Salisbury was a relative newcomer to the senior ranks. He was a talented investor who had only ever managed a team of several hundred people.\\\\u00a0When Lane departed six months later in March 2021, it left Salisbury in charge of a division of about 5,000 people. It wasn\\'t until the following January that Luke Sarsfield, an investment banker said to be close with Waldron, was named to cohead the division.\\\\u00a0 Sarsfield also didn\\'t have management or operations experience that would have prepared him to run a sprawling division.\\\\u00a0When both men struggled, senior partners left, and Goldman stumbled in its efforts to wind down its balance-sheet investments. Salisbury and Sarsfield have both left the bank.Solomon has now tapped Marc Nachmann to run the asset-management business. Even Nachmann, known internally for his operational chops, is a stranger to the world of asset management, having spent most of his career as a banker, and then the past three years in the markets division. He\\'s having to do a lot of learning on the job, two of the people said.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"The asset-management business is one where all of these consultants, all of these clients, want longevity,\\\\\" one former partner said. \\\\\"They are frustrated with having the churn.\\\\\"Solomon addressed the turnover at the investor conference, saying: \\\\\"Whenever you put businesses together, there\\'s going to be disruption and there\\'s going to be volatility.\\\\\"The CEO said he\\'s satisfied with the division\\'s leadership and excited about its future.\\\\\"We think we\\'re well positioned, and one of the things that gives us such confidence is the feedback from our clients about our offering, the mandates we\\'re competing for and winning, gives us a lot of comfort that we have something unique that can be powerful and can grow over time,\\\\\" he said.Goldman recently won the right to manage two pensions holding \\\\u00a323 billion, or about $28.5 billion, for the defense company BAE Systems.\\\\u00a0Fratto said the asset-management division was \\\\\"exceeding its targets under Marc\\'s leadership,\\\\\" adding that the firm promoted 11 investors to partner this year and hired another nine managing directors to invest on clients\\' behalf. Attrition is the lowest it has been in years, Goldman says.\\\\u00a0Solomon took a similar managerial approach in naming an inexperienced executive when he selected Stephanie Cohen to corun the firm\\'s consumer-banking division. Cohen also hadn\\'t run a large division before, and people with direct knowledge of her leadership said they believed the division suffered as a result. After head count and expenses spiked in 2022, Solomon finally pulled the plug and ordered a large-scale retreat.\\\\u00a0Now overseeing a much-scaled-down division called platform solutions, Cohen is on leave.Solomon \\\\\"has a big ego, is ambitious, and really wants to disrupt,\\\\\" one of the former partners said, adding: \\\\\"He wants to think out of the box and wants people who don\\'t seem to make sense. He underestimated the pushback he would get from the people on the ground.\\\\\"There are other examples. Solomon chose as his chief legal officer, Kathy Ruemmler, President Barack Obama\\'s White House counsel and a former Justice Department attorney who helped convict the Enron executives Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. Hired as the head of regulatory affairs in 2020, Ruemmler became the firm\\'s top lawyer the following year.\\\\u00a0Unbeknown to Goldman\\'s partners, Ruemmler held dozens of meetings with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the years before she joined Goldman, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. While Ruemmler disclosed the meetings before she was hired, a Goldman spokesperson told Bloomberg, her hiring in the face of that knowledge has left several people who spoke with Insider questioning Solomon\\'s judgment \\\\u2014 Ruemmler cochairs Goldman\\'s reputational-risk committee.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\\\\\" Ruemmler told the Journal.On Wall Street, one thing that can be counted on to ease personnel problems is pay. There\\'s no question that Solomon disappointed on that front last year as the boom of mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings dried up.But now, the question raging among Goldman\\'s highest earners is whether the 2022 bonus disappointment is part of a changing norm as Solomon adjusts how to spread the wealth in good times and in bad.Goldman Sachs partners are paid well by any standard: $950,000 in base salary and often multiples of that in annual bonuses. Bonuses were exceptional in 2021, thanks to a pandemic-fueled increase in trading and investment banking.\\\\u00a0But last year felt very different to the people Insider spoke with. The discomfort started about midyear, when Solomon and Waldron started communicating compensation levels to managers in a way that made many people believe that something might have changed about their approach, four of the people said.\\\\u00a0That was right around the time that losses were beginning to mount in Goldman\\'s consumer bank, and it didn\\'t take long for partners to put two and two together.\\\\u00a0Though partners were long accustomed to working from the bottom up to figure out compensation levels, Solomon and Waldron last year imposed top-down figures that suggested they had little understanding of what each desk or business was paying its people, the people said.When managers looked at their teams and calculated the base salaries they were paying out and the bonuses they expected to pay to keep people, the two sides were far apart, two of the people told Insider. The money Goldman had set aside for compensation and benefits heading into the fourth quarter was over $3 billion less than in the prior year.\\\\u00a0Managers pushed back on those top-line figures, and by the end of the year, Solomon and Waldron relented and topped up the compensation pool.The adjustment increased the compensation ratio to 32% for the year, compared with 30% the prior two years, and resulted in fourth-quarter results that, one analyst said, were \\\\\"even more miserable than anticipated.\\\\\"But by then, three former partners that Insider spoke with said they had come to believe that Solomon was inclined to reward shareholders at the expense of employees. After all, Solomon had become CEO in late 2018 with a mandate to bring more corporate accountability to a company that had been run as a private partnership before going public in 1999.It was a clear signal to them, in other words, that the way Goldman had traditionally paid its people \\\\u2014 for example, by paying investment bankers to maintain relationships even during years when dealmaking was slow \\\\u2014 had fundamentally changed.\\\\u00a0Fratto, the spokesperson, disputed that interpretation, saying: \\\\\"The process for compensation did not change at all. Business heads fight for compensation for their people every single year. The only thing that changed in 2022 was that it was a relative down year off a record high in 2021.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0Current partners are now looking to the 2023 compensation cycle for signs that Solomon still has their interests in mind. If it\\'s another year like 2022, some people fear there will be another wave of exits.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"A decade-high decline in comp in 2022 probably caused a degree of extra concern on the part of some employees,\\\\\" Mayo wrote in his September 18 report. He added that he worried that Goldman \\\\\"could feel a need to transfer more wealth from shareholders to employees to placate any potential situation.\\\\\"What\\'s not in dispute is that Solomon and Waldron have less flexibility when it comes to paying people because of how large Goldman\\'s staff has become.Last year, for example, pay and benefits fell 15%, while its staff rose 10%.Over the four years through 2022, head count ballooned 33%, to 48,500 from 36,600. Many people who have been hired in technology or consumer-banking roles get a higher percentage of their compensation in base salary. That\\'s the opposite for investment bankers and traders, who get a larger portion of their compensation in variable bonuses.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"It was a massive ballooning of head count to support the consumer and tech build-out,\\\\\" one of the people said, citing Goldman\\'s expansion in lower-cost locations such as Texas. \\\\\"Those are people in Plano making $100,000 a year, so there is not a lot of variability.\\\\\"Solomon has begun to reverse the head-count trend, firing 3,200 people earlier this year to bring the increase during his tenure to 21%.\\\\u00a0One of the people who spoke with Insider described the shift in compensation structure more simply: \\\\\"If you have a blowout year, you pay top performers very well. You don\\'t need to use those discretionary dollars on the people who have more of a fixed compensation scheme. It works in reverse, too, so you can\\'t pay top performers very well in down years.\\\\\"Fratto disputed that characterization, saying: \\\\\"This makes no sense for Goldman Sachs compensation structure or decision making.\\\\\"That increase in head count has brought additional bureaucracy, some of the people said. Solomon, to his credit, according to one person who spoke with Insider, has sought to eliminate red tape wherever he can, for example, by encouraging partners to call or text him directly rather than going through assistants.\\\\u00a0But for investment bankers, traders, and portfolio managers who like to do deals, their reality is that a significantly larger firm\\\\u00a0is in danger of becoming unwieldy. Partners\\' roles are now taken up with more paperwork than some of them would like, three of the people said.\\\\u00a0The pressures of more people are going to increase as Goldman ramps up hiring in the wake of increased scrutiny from the Federal Reserve.Bloomberg reported last month that Goldman was hiring for several hundred back-office roles to help address the Fed\\'s concerns, but the people who spoke with Insider said it might take months, if not longer, for Goldman to shake the Fed\\'s scrutiny.\\\\u00a0While most banks face regular scrutiny from their regulators, some of the people said the focus on Goldman is at least partly driven by Solomon\\'s headlong push into consumer banking, a highly regulated industry.\\\\\"The Fed is all over us,\\\\\" one person said. \\\\\"And David doesn\\'t want to acknowledge it\\'s all driven by the consumer business.\\\\\"In 2022, Solomon publicly acknowledged that Goldman\\'s consumer ambitions were costing the company too much money. He has been scaling them back ever since. Late last month, for example, Goldman sold off a business it had acquired when it bought United Capital Financial Partners for $750 million in 2019.\\\\u00a0The bank is also now selling its GreenSky point-of-sale financing business. Yet the acquisition, which Goldman made in 2021 for $2.2 billion, still rankles Goldmanites. The deal never made sense to many people inside Goldman, especially those in its investment-banking division who had spent their careers advising corporate executives on takeover targets.\\\\u00a0With GreenSky, Goldman took a financial-technology firm valued at a high multiple that used other banks\\' funding and turned it into a business dependent on Goldman\\'s balance sheet with a lower multiple.It\\'s not just internal people who have noticed. One former partner who spoke with Insider said that in calling on clients, people had had to answer for Goldman\\'s consumer-banking missteps.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"It\\'s kind of embarrassing when you are showing up to a client pitching for M&A business, position yourself as the best M&A advisor, pointing to these credentials, and our own deals have been an absolute mess,\\\\\" the person said. \\\\\"The number of jokes clients make, and there is some truth, why hire you to do M&A if you can\\'t even do your own M&A.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0Fratto noted that Goldman had been ranked No. 1 in M&A advisory for 20 years running, adding that the firm\\'s consumer troubles were mostly behind it.\\\\\"We began narrowing our consumer ambitions nearly a year ago, have been executing on that strategy ever since, and the market has reacted positively,\\\\\" he said.\\\\u00a0Goldman has said that much of the bad press surrounding the CEO has come from former partners who disagree with the firm\\'s direction, with Fratto saying it\\'s \\\\\"not surprising\\\\\" that many of Insider\\'s sources were \\\\\"disgruntled former employees.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0Even so, Solomon apparently believes that if he can win back the former partners, some of the noise will die down, one of the former partners said.\\\\u00a0To that end, Solomon has gone on offense, charging Alison Mass, the chair of investment banking, with leading the office of alumni engagement and winning back the hearts and minds of the partnership. Over the past several months, Mass has hosted numerous dinners and get-togethers for former partners, in places including London, Paris, and Chicago, where Solomon and former CEO and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson spoke to a group of ex-partners.\\\\\"He is on a campaign to reconnect with the ex-partners,\\\\\" one person who saw Solomon at one of the alumni events said. \\\\\"If he can get them to back off and get them to be supportive, that will help.\\\\\"Solomon has also wooed partners at his Wooster Street apartment in lower Manhattan.Last month, Solomon brought a respected former partner, Russell Horwitz, back into the fold by hiring him as the firm\\'s chief of staff. Several of the former partners who spoke with Insider supported that move.The stakes are high as Solomon faces the biggest test of his five-year stint.\\\\u00a0The company\\'s board met earlier this month when firmwide succession planning was high on the discussion list. And the bank is set to report third-quarter earnings next month. Ryan, the JMP analyst, said he expected quarterly revenue of $12.4 billion, which would be the most in six quarters.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0If Solomon can put up better numbers, and weather the media storm around partner exits and his personality, the CEO may outlast his critics.Mayo agrees, writing after his meeting with Ogunlesi that \\\\\"our conclusion is that the CEO is not going anywhere anytime soon,\\\\\" based in part on his belief that the \\\\\"board is in anything but caretaker mode, as reflected by the engagement of the lead director.\\\\\"That means Solomon still has time to cement his legacy.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"The people that are really unhappy with the way that David has run the firm are being flushed out, they are cutting their ties with the firm, and they are deciding it\\'s not the place it used to be,\\\\\" one of the former partners said. \\\\\"The people who are left behind are those who are in support.

Private credit is most often floating-rate debt \\\\u2014 that is, debt where interest rates rise in concert with rate hikes.

Private credit strategies like direct lending (which makes up the larget portion of private credit assets), mezzanine capital, and asset-backed lending demand specialized skill sets, noted Richard Fernand, head of certificate management at the CFA Institute.\\\\u00a0Some business schools are seeing a subtle shift in where students are going. Nicholas Kalogeropoulos, senior associate director of employee relations for Columbia Business School, said there has been a steady increase in interest from firms seeking to recruit the school\\'s students for private credit positions in the past few years, though this is from a very small base as the space is nascent and private credit has not historically targeted MBAs.Even by Wall Street standards, the private credit market is commanding large paydays, a theme magnified while firms increasingly seek out people specializing in restructuring for portfolio companies gone bad.\\\\u00a0In demand, too, are private credit-focused investor relations roles, with competitive pay packages to match, said Sam Iles, executive director and cohead of distribution at asset management consultancy Alpha FMC. Acerra of Spencer Stuart said he isn\\'t hearing much demand from candidates necessarily choosing between banking and private credit roles at the executive level, where his team is active. But at junior levels, he senses that \\\\\"banks are losing high-quality junior bankers to private credit roles, as opposed to the traditional buyout roles they might otherwise have favored.\\\\\"Robb of Eastward said that for private credit funds seeking workout talent in the past year, \\\\\"I\\'ve negotiated packages that are more than $2 million, guaranteed for multiple years, which is somewhat unheard of.\\\\\"The demand for private credit extends to the attorneys these firms hire.\\\\\"For most of my career, attracting new attorneys to private credit was a challenge. They didn\\'t quite know what it was, were concerned about committing long-term, or oftentimes, viewed finance as a boring practice area,\\\\\" said Mike Mezzacappa, partner and cohead of private credit at the law firm Proskauer. Proskauer\\'s private credit group now has 90 lawyers, 24 of whom are partners, working full-time on private credit. Evan Palenschat, a newer partner in the group, noted that more firms are starting to brand practices as \\\\\"private credit\\\\\" or \\\\\"direct lending.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0The industry is grappling with what rising rates mean for the companies they have invested in, both on the debt and equity sides, including monitoring defaults.Last week, KKR\\'s chief financial officer, Robert Lewin, said default rates are ticking up, though they are below their 10-year rolling averages. \\\\\"Relative to expectations, I think it has been better across the board,\\\\\" he said at a conference hosted by Barclays. Goldman Sachs research analysts noted in a June report that Moody\\'s forecasts the loan default rate to increase to a peak of 6% next year from 1.5% in the last two years.Acerra of Spencer Stuart said default risks broadly are \\\\\"somewhat tempered,\\\\\" pointing to firms creating custom agreements with portfolio companies, known as covenants, to protect against default.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"That said, I expect more private credit lenders will need to be set up to handle restructurings and workouts in-house, which is a trend that we expect will accelerate,\\\\\" Acerra said.\\\\u00a0Private credit is an attractive career for people in financial services in part because \\\\\"banks naturally have more capital constraints and private credit firms are not regulated in the same way,\\\\\" Heller of Caldwell said. \\\\\"But at some point, the market can saturate.\\\\\"\", \"label\": \"Finance, BI Prime, Finance, Asset Management, Wall Street\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-private-credit-careers-asset-management-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"I Make the Impossible Possible for Some of America\\'s Richest People\", \"date\": \"2023-09-17 14:47:26+00:00\", \"content\": \"This is an as-told-to essay based on a transcribed conversation with Rey Flemings, 50, the founder and CEO of community and concierge service app Myria. The following has been edited for length and clarity.I created Myria, a community and concierge for ultra-high-net-worth individuals in 2021. It works in two ways. There\\'s a community for members to connect with one another through our app, and there\\'s an access side where they can get off-market luxury experiences.From my time working with big celebrities, I\\'ve learned that A-list celebrities have access that the rich don\\'t.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0We are highly selective about who our members are and what their personal profile looks like.\\\\u00a0Membership starts at $30,000 per person per year. Myria has 35 members, but we plan to accept a further 85 by the end of this year.We have a waiting list of about 1,000 names, but we only let in small numbers at a time.Over half of our business is experiential \\\\u2014 on things like travel and events.The remainder is more serious: staffing, hiring, security, professional services, and dealing with crises.The general rule of thumb for using Myria is that if your assistant can do it, then your assistant should do it. For everything else, call Myria.\\\\u00a0Right before the world essentially shut down due to the pandemic, we threw a birthday party for a client\\'s wife.The client is the CEO of a Fortune 100 company and wanted to go all out, so we hired around 100 people to work the event and got Pitbull to perform.We had it all filmed as a reality show that they could watch later.A level one request is easy \\\\u2014 something anyone can do or likely can purchase online. Level five requests are all but impossible.\\\\u00a0Let\\'s say you wanted to get a VIP pass to Coachella, anyone with internet access and a credit card can buy that.A level two request could be someone wanting to attend an after-party at a fancy villa in Palm Springs or maybe booking a private jet.\\\\u00a0Level three requests are off-market \\\\u2014 things that you can\\'t Google. For example, a backstage pass to Coachella with an all-access artist\\'s credentials. They sell them but there\\'s no website where you could go to find it.A level four request could be getting a backstage pass to Beyonce\\'s headline performance.\\\\u00a0But the vast majority of our business isn\\'t celebrity-driven. People have very diverse interests.Before launching Myria, I set up and ran an offline concierge service called The Blue. Before that, I was CEO of Particle, which was sold to Apple in 2010.In the startup world, I met a lot of people who had built big fortunes and built relationships with them.I\\'ve helped produce events and taken care of the biggest celebrities in the world and some of the most prominent families on the planet, including the Justin Timberlake family office, which I\\'ve worked with for eight years.I came from not very much in Memphis, Tennessee. I attended a public junior high school, but my principal suggested I attend a private all-boys school, which happened to be one of the best in the southeastern US. It has a lot of renowned alumni, from the founder of FedEx to Paul Tudor Jones, one of the most famous option traders in history \\\\u2014 so I was exposed to a world of wealth.\\\\u00a0In the 1990s, my mentor asked me if I could make digital presentations for his financial services business to some wealthy families.Over the next four years I pitched hundreds of presentations to super-rich families and got an understanding of their concerns, who they were, and their interests. That experience was the best training ground that I could ever have and it has enabled me to be able to do what I do today.\", \"label\": \"Careers, Finance, Tech\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/ultra-exclusive-concierge-app-myria-wealthy-clients-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Finance Execs in China Spend 30% of Working Day on \\'Xi Thought,\\' Report Says\", \"date\": \"2023-09-19 13:53:13+00:00\", \"content\": \"Employees of the global finance firm BlackRock, together with other bankers and business leaders in China, are said to be spending up to a third of their working time engaging in materials related to \\\\\"Xi Jinping Thought,\\\\\" per Bloomberg.Study sessions have now apparently become mandatory for many employees at non-state-owned companies, including foreign staff members at international firms.In June, some employees of the financial firms Franklin Templeton and BlackRock were ordered to attend a lecture on sticking to the party\\'s leadership in the industry, Bloomberg reported. Some have reported having to join activities or courses, or read numerous books on the subject each month.First published in 2017, Xi Jinping Thought lays out 14 principles by which China will prosper. It follows a pattern of Chinese leaders building on the original Marxist-Leninist teachings. Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin all introduced their own revised teachings on the theory that underpins China\\'s communist political system.But Beijing\\'s promotion of the doctrine fits into the shift towards prioritising ideology to maintain the party\\'s grip on power as economic pressures have mounted.In addition to the pressure to study of Xi\\'s doctrine, new laws have limited international banks\\' abilities to operate as normal in China.Amendments to the country\\'s counter-espionage laws have hindered typical business practices including gathering information on local markets, potential partners, and competitors, as well as making accurate reporting to investors and regulators more difficult by cutting access to certain sources of information to non-local businesses.In March, Deloitte was fined $31 million after an official investigation found \\\\\"serious deficiencies\\\\\" in its audit of a state-owned debt management firm, per the Financial Times.Meanwhile, China\\'s foreign relations law makes clear that foreign nationals will not be exempt from China\\'s increasing control over private business. \\\\\"Foreigners and foreign organisations in mainland China shall comply with Chinese law and must not endanger China\\'s national security, harm the societal public interest, or undermine societal public order,\\'\\\\\" the law states, per the Financial Times.\\\\u00a0Correction: September 19, 2023 \\\\u2014 An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of Xi Jinping.\", \"label\": \"Finance, China\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-execs-in-china-ordered-spend-working-day-xi-thought-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Meet Fran\\\\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, World\\'s Richest Woman Worth $87B\", \"date\": \"2023-09-16 11:24:40+00:00\", \"content\": \"Fran\\\\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers, the 70-year-old granddaughter of L\\'Oreal founder Eug\\\\u00e8ne Schueller, is the richest woman in the world, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\\\u00a0Bettencourt Meyers is worth almost $88 billion, mostly due to her stake in L\\'Oreal.

Other growing applications of AI include dubbing, recreating voices of bygone actors, and restoring old films and TV series.\\\\u00a0The number of new original series soared in recent years to feed the booming appetite for streaming content. The pitch of these startups is that their tools can aid artists overwhelmed by the explosion of work associated with that growth.MARZ has a new tool, Vanity AI, that reduces to 20 minutes what it used to take a special effects artist three days to do. \\\\\"Anything you can do in VFX that saves time and capacity is welcomed with open arms,\\\\\" COO Matt Panousis said.\\\\u00a0Investors are flocking to these companies because they figure if the new AI tools they\\'re making can satisfy Hollywood\\'s standards for quality and verisimilitude, other industries will fall in line to use them, too. Deepdub, for example, in July announced it was expanding to serve industries outside of entertainment.Investment in AI startups for entertainment is \\\\\"blowing up right now,\\\\\" Michael Blank, head of consumer investing at CAA, told Insider in March.

AI has been a key issue in the Writers Guild of America\\'s strike against the studios as film and TV writers seek guardrails on its use in generating content. The actors\\' guild, SAG-AFTRA, has battled over the issue in contract negotiations, while the Directors Guild of America reached a tentative agreement acknowledging that \\\\\"AI is not a person.\\\\\"There are also worries about the nascent technology being used to deceive viewers and exploit actors.There are already AI tools that can write full scripts.

The average price return for an NBA team, for example, was 1,057% from 2002 to 2021, per PitchBook.Now rich individuals have to compete with institutional investors like private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds for a limited number of teams. As a result, aspiring team owners have gotten more creative to seal the deal.Many are joining forces in order to amass enough cash for a controlling stake. Actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, for instance, bought Welsh minor-league soccer club Wrexham AFC for $2.5 million in 2021. Less popular sports, such as pickleball, are also drawing investors, with LeBron James buying a team this past October.Even billionaires are looking overseas for opportunities, such as former co-owner of the NBA\\'s Milwaukee Bucks Marc Lasry, who is eyeing African and Asian basketball teams.Goldman Sachs, which has worked on a number of high-profile sports deals like financing the stadium for the\\\\u00a0National Football League\\'s Tennessee Titans, is helping its wealthy clients get a piece of the action. On the back of demand for \\\\\"the rapid increase in capital\\\\\" looking to invest in the sports industry, the bank is creating a new unit of sports dealmakers, Goldman Sachs announced in a memo Friday. The new team aims to work with its wealth business to pitch investments in sports teams and stadiums to its rich clients.These trends are likely to continue as valuations show no sign of cooling off, according to Brian Kantarian, head of sports finance in JPMorgan\\'s private bank. A controlling stake in a NFL team requires at least $2 billion of cash equity, he told Insider. Apollo cofounder Josh Harris bought the NFL\\'s Washington Commanders for a record-breaking $6.05 billion this summer.\\\\\"Some of what\\'s driving interest towards these more nascent leagues is that the entry point is achievable, especially if you want to have a say in club operations and be any kind of decision-maker,\\\\\" Kantarian told Insider.Professional sports are viewed by many as a recession-proof investment. Even when discretionary income drops, some consumers continue to go to games in order to take their minds off their troubles, Kantarian said.\\\\\"Sports, given the passion aspect of it, will continue to play an important role in people\\'s lives,\\\\\" he said.\\\\u00a0Much of this resilience can be credited to the rising value of media rights, according to Ivo Voynov, who leads sport finance for Citi Private Bank.He has observed that newer investors, whether their backgrounds are in tech or private equity, have brought a new sophistication to sports team ownership. Due to the rising costs of controlling stakes, many have formed syndicates of other high-net-worth limited partners to buy teams.\\\\\"It\\'s brought this sense of building up real companies around these assets that used to be thought of as nice-to-have trophy assets that you could talk about at cocktail parties,\\\\\" he told Insider.American investors are also becoming more dominant in European soccer leagues, according to Voynov. More than a third of clubs in Europe\\'s Big Five soccer leagues are backed by US investors, including private equity firms and high-net-worth investors, according to PitchBook.\\\\\"The perception is that there are a lot of inefficiencies in the way clubs are run there, and then potentially you could bring in some of the lessons learned in the US to Europe and improve operations, whether its data and analytics,\\\\\" he said.Plenty of investors have no attachment to their franchises before inking the deal.\\\\\"I think it\\'s my biggest competitive advantage that I don\\'t get emotionally attached,\\\\\" RedBird Capital CEO Gerry Cardinale told Insider in December. \\\\\"They\\'re all pieces of intellectual property that have a legitimate right to be monetized as long as they balance the fan-social contract at the same time.\\\\\"But most team owners often become personally invested, according to Kantarian and Voynov.\\\\\"A lot of the owners we work with, they may have initially approached the investment looking at the metrics and the financials and the growth rates, but they get in the owner\\'s seat and suddenly they want to win,\\\\\" Kantarian told Insider.Despite the flurry of M&A activity, the number of sports teams is largely static. Starting a new league is risky and expensive. The XFL, a spring football league, is on its third try after first launching two decades ago.Advising on deals in European soccer has proved to be big business for Wall Street banks. But banks have limited interest when it comes to emerging sports like pickleball. JPMorgan, for instance, generally does not finance debt if the league involved is less than 10 years old, Kantarian said. The bank also considers the existing owners involved and whether they are current clients or prospective ones.These investments are also typically regarded as evergreen investments, Voynov said.\\\\\"It\\'s never going to be a private equity type of model where these assets will be exited every five years,\\\\\" he told Insider. \\\\\"You\\'re becoming part of the community so it\\'s not as easy to extricate yourself in those scenarios.\\\\\"\", \"label\": \"Finance, BI Prime, Investing, Billionaires, Private Equity\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/rich-sports-team-owners-investing-private-equity-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"David Marcus Lays Out Why Meta\\'s Crypto Plans Failed and How That Influenced His New Startup\", \"date\": \"2023-09-21 13:58:19+00:00\", \"content\": \"After years of pie-in-the-sky dreams and pitches, crypto founders have become more realistic.Perhaps that\\'s because of the market \\\\u2014 investors are more willing to suspend disbelief when rates are low \\\\u2014 or thanks to the industry\\'s well-known bad actors, but either way, those remaining are no longer promising to take over the world.David Marcus is a good example.The one-time president of PayPal was the head of the failed stablecoin project at Facebook, now Meta, which was known as Libra and Diem at different points in its short existence. With an ultimate goal to be the go-to currency for the global financial system, it was, in hindsight, too ambitious, Marcus admits now.Speaking to reporters at Andreessen Horowitz\\'s downtown Manhattan office, he explained how they were too \\\\\"idealistic\\\\\" with their original idea.\\\\\"If you\\'re dependent on one centralized stablecoin to do global payments, it\\'s a problem as we\\'ve experienced firsthand,\\\\\" he said.Now, his new startup Lightspark is working within the system \\\\u2014 building on top of Bitcoin to connect, but not replace, governments and their local currencies. Investors, including well-known venture shops like a16z and Paradigm, have poured $175 million into the new company already.In 2019 Meta unveiled plans to create a digital currency pegged to hard currencies including the US dollar. The idea was that people using Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp would be able to send cryptocurrency seamlessly around the world, which could later be be changed for local currencies.Libra\\'s goal to make \\\\\"everyone happy and it\\'ll be wonderful and everyone will agree,\\\\\" Marcus said, couldn\\'t mesh with political realities.\\\\\"You don\\'t want a private company to become massive in controlling the unit of account and managing reserves at a single point of failure,\\\\\" Marcus said.\\\\\"If you depeg and it\\'s a centralized company that\\'s managed privately, governments really don\\'t like that \\\\u2014 they want to be in control of their unit of account, they want to be in control of their currency.\\\\\"The project was zealous, even for pie-in-the-sky crypto standards. Massive payment companies like Visa, regulators across the globe including the Securities and Exchange Commission, and politicians were going to have to work together and approve a radical transformation of global financial policy that was coming from a company known for scandal after scandal tied to user data and privacy.Even Mark Zuckerberg admitted in his testimony to Congress on the project that his company might not be the \\\\\"ideal messenger\\\\\" for Libra. Regulatory roadblocks and concerns over Facebook\\'s data privacy eventually stalled the project.While Marcus is best known for his time spent at PayPal and Meta, he\\'s founded three companies that went on to be bought by competitors.When he announced in a tweet in November 2021 that he was leaving Meta he added: \\\\\"my entrepreneurial DNA has been nudging me for too many mornings in a row to continue ignoring it.\\\\\"With his new startup, Lightspark, Marcus plans to hypercharge the global payments system is simpler, or at least less grandiose.Users will swap their local currency for bitcoin and then have it converted to the local currency of whichever country the capital is needed in. Marcus likens it to a software-as-a-service company; it makes revenue on transaction fees.The Los Angeles-based company uses bitcoin as its \\\\\"neutral internet money\\\\\" for several reasons, mainly its liquidity and the regulatory clarity governments have provided on the digital currency. Plus, it is not tied to one particular country so there is less geopolitical mistrust.Lightspark is using the best part of the crypto industry\\'s progress, said Christian Catalini, Marcus\\'s cofounder who previously worked at Facebook with him.\\\\\"The most valuable thing that\\'s been built has been the connection to legacy systems,\\\\\" he said. Given bitcoin\\'s popularity around the world, exchanges in far-flung locales have the ability to transfer it to local currencies. It\\'s an area that JPMorgan is reportedly looking at too. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Wall Street bank was exploring a blockchain-based deposit token for faster cross-border payments and settlements.Marcus and Catalini have signed up different exchanges like Bahrain-based Rain and crypto wallets and are hoping to have the first currency transfers go through later this year. Next year, Marcus said, the firm hopes to \\\\\"seriously ramp it up.\\\\\"\\\\\"Money is the last thing that doesn\\'t move over the internet.\\\\\"\", \"label\": \"Finance, Finance, Wall Street, Meta\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/david-marcus-failed-facebook-meta-stablecoin-plans-new-startup-lightspark-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Deutsche Bank to Launch Gen AI Tools and Hire Hundreds of Engineers\", \"date\": \"2023-09-14 16:31:56+00:00\", \"content\": \"A handful of men clustered around a structure of half a dozen computer screens erected overhead. They stood face-to-face with what could be the future of banking.\\\\u00a0With a touchscreen pre-populated with questions in front of them, they queried the machine about the performance and ESG strategy of a fictitious company called Cymbal. Line graphs, bar charts, company reports, and stock charts whirled across the screens. Then they cut to black before text came into focus to provide intel on Cymbal, a hypothetical corporate client of Deutsche Bank.The tool presented a client briefing, a report to prep investment bankers before client meetings. Thanks to generative AI, what would usually take a team of junior bankers a day or two to put together was produced in seconds.The German bank\\'s interest in the buzzy technology was fully displayed at Google Cloud Next 2023 in San Francisco in late August. Live demos of genAI tools drove a steady stream of admirers as they experimented with souped-up chatbots that could change language mid-conversation, dashboards that brainstormed potential clients, and a new way to generate software code.Generative AI has become all the rage on the Street since the splashy debut of ChatGPT. For all of Wall Street\\'s interest and investment in generative AI, many are still exploring applications of the technology.Deutsche Bank is aiming to transform the business and work of banking. The firm is running about 25 pilots, with many experiments going live in early 2024. It is looking to double or triple its AI-related workforce in the next year and retrain existing front- and back-office employees as the technology permeates DB\\'s ranks, from HR to tech to the investment bank. But it will also be a trusting moment for the bank, with a minefield of unknowns, including future costs, evolving regulations, and a talent war that\\'s heating up.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"On generative AI, it\\'s like net new. There are no benchmarks. There\\'s a lot of assumptions,\\\\\" Gil Perez, Deutsche Bank\\'s chief innovation officer, told Insider.\\\\\"You need to basically get people to do a bit of a leap of faith and say, \\'Yes, I understand that we don\\'t have all of the details, but we will get there.\\' And that\\'s really difficult for a lot of boardrooms, a lot of CFOs,\\\\\" Perez said.Deutsche Bank has been establishing its AI strategy since 2021, a year after the bank pivoted to the public cloud, forming a partnership with Google Cloud. A centralized AI team with less than 100 technologists builds core AI capabilities.\\\\u00a0The bank is aggressively hiring more technologists to build out its AI empire. In total, between 300 to 400 technologists are working on all of Deutsche\\'s AI projects. Perez said the bank will at least double, maybe even triple, the size of the team in the next 12 months.A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined to comment on the amount it is investing in its AI efforts.What\\'s unique about the bank\\'s approach is that it is being driven by about 13 chief operating officers who span the firm and suggest ideas for how to improve their business lines through tech.\\\\u00a0With the business driving the momentum behind Deutsche\\'s AI ambitions, technology is being developed at an unprecedented speed. Usually, tech needs to convince the business to allocate budget before a new capability or tool can be developed \\\\u2014 and that\\'s usually met with pushback about years\\' long product roadmaps, Perez said.\\\\u00a0But with ideas generated by the businesses themselves, tech teams get the green flag to move quicker.\\\\\"The analogy is that we\\'re not pushing any more, we\\'re being pushed,\\\\\" Perez said.By as early as January, a day in the life of a Deutsche banker could look very different. The corporate bank, which drew in 1.6 billion euros, or more than $2 billion, in revenue in the second quarter, serves Deutsche\\'s institutional clients, financial services firms, and investors.\\\\u00a0The division has been a hotbed of experimentation ever since February, and many of the use cases are targeted at improving time-consuming processes usually shouldered by junior ranks.\\\\u00a0The pilot that was on display at the Google event produced a client briefing with the touch of a few keystrokes.\\\\u00a0The time saved will allow junior bankers to spend more time critically thinking about the client, headwinds within their industry, or something a client isn\\'t doing that its competitors are, Tamara Bitticks, vice chair within the corporate bank, told Insider. Bankers can focus on building people skills, like building trust, reading the room, and being a good listener, she added.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"What I struggle with our juniors a lot of times is they\\'re gathering the information, and they\\'re so consumed with the gathering that they don\\'t think about the analyzing,\\\\\" Bitticks said.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"It will be a new way of being a banker,\\\\\" she said.Deutsche is currently piloting a genAI chatbot to serve corporate and investment banking clients. It has the ability to answer complex questions, like if a client needs to update account signatories, the chatbot could provide the total number of accounts a client has where a specific person is a signatory or authorizer.The bank has plans to launch the chatbot in the first quarter of 2024. It\\'s testing it on a sampling of everyday customers and internally for HR employees. Reusability of these so-called core platforms will be a core piece of how Deutsche scales its AI capabilities, Perez said.Deutsche Bank\\'s genAI journey won\\'t be easy to pull off.\\\\u00a0The bank will need to compete for in-demand AI tech talent, a market that is only set to heat up. And it will need to establish retraining and upskilling programs for existing employees across the firm, not just the developers building the tech.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"We are going to ensure that people understand that you now have somebody that helps you, just like a personal assistant helps you and does something for you, but at the end of the day you need to take responsibility,\\\\\" he said.\\\\u00a0There\\'s also a gap between regulatory acceptance and generative AI. Red tape is a common source of frustration for many innovation and tech teams on Wall Street, but how Washington D.C. will regulate genAI has yet to be determined.\\\\u00a0Determining the technology\\'s return on investment will be another tricky unknown to navigate.

Our opinions are always our own.When Michael Burry decided to invest in a mortgage-tech company, it made headlines.\\\\\"\\'Big Short\\'\\\\\" hero goes long mortgage startup,\\\\\" CNBC announced in December 2015, days ahead of Hollywood\\'s debut of the movie in which Burry, who played a role in ringing alarm bells over the housing bubble that caused the Great Recession, is played by Christian Bale.Burry\\'s \\\\\"long\\\\\" was PeerStreet, a real-estate-crowdfunding website that allowed qualified investors to buy a piece of a mortgage on a residential property, usually a rental. Crowdfunding had popped up in the wake of the financial crisis that made Burry\\'s name, offering the promise of private-equity-style returns to smaller investors.\\\\\"What happened in the crisis is there was practically no underwriting,\\\\\" Burry was quoted as saying at the time. \\\\\"It\\'s important for the next-generation alternative lending model that there be controls in place. There\\'s somebody at the door checking for excess credit risk.\\\\\"Just eight years and $121.9 million in funding later, including from the Silicon Valley behemoth Andreessen Horowitz, Burry\\'s optimism was proved wrong. PeerStreet and its affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 26 after its lending business dropped to $5.4 million in mortgage originations, down from $695 million in 2021.PeerStreet blamed its collapse on plummeting demand amid rising rates. But the bankruptcy documents show the empty promises of real-estate crowdfunding, which rose from the ashes of the global financial crisis, to \\\\\"democratize\\\\\" real-estate investing and give the little guy a chance at the spoils previously enjoyed only by the fabulously wealthy. With the help of hundreds of millions in venture capital, this pocket of investing morphed into a $14 billion industry by 2022, anchored by major companies such as Yieldstreet, CrowdStreet, and, for a time, Fundrise.Insider pored over hundreds of court filings, spoke with bankruptcy and crowdfunding experts, and interviewed six PeerStreet investors and one former employee to find out what went wrong. We found that most of the company\\'s loans were \\\\\"nonperforming,\\\\\" indicating that the majority of PeerStreet\\'s investors loaned money to borrowers who\\'ve stopped paying them back.\\\\u00a0More importantly, many PeerStreet investors who thought they were purchasing a slice of a loan in a property have learned that they did no such thing, at least according to the company. PeerStreet has told a Delaware federal bankruptcy-court judge that it sold financial instruments that acted as fractions of mortgages instead of mortgages themselves, giving the company the right to sell the loans in bankruptcy.The question of ownership is before Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein. Depending on how she rules, many PeerStreet investors stand to lose much of their investment \\\\u2014 raising questions about the viability of the real-estate-crowdfunding business model for Main Street investors.PeerStreet CEO Brew Johnson told Insider he\\'s \\\\\"unable to comment at this time.\\\\\"A ruling in favor of PeerStreet \\\\\"will break people\\'s trust in the crowdfunding platforms as a whole,\\\\\" Braun Mincher, a PeerStreet investor, told Insider.Like many PeerStreet investors who spoke with Insider, Mincher has a strong r\\\\u00e9sum\\\\u00e9. He\\'s a tech entrepreneur who has successfully exited multiple businesses and has experience as both a buyer of real estate and a direct lender to real-estate projects. He is a founding shareholder of a $250 million community bank and served as the head of the committee of creditors in another Delaware bankruptcy case. He even wrote a book on personal finance.Yet the extent of the prospective losses stemming from PeerStreet\\'s bankruptcy has taken even sophisticated investors such as him by surprise.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"I feel that I\\'m savvy, but I feel duped by what they\\'re trying to do here,\\\\\" Mincher said, echoing language filed in letters to the court, including one from a noteholder who said they felt like the \\\\\"victim of an investing scam.\\\\\"Crowdfunding took hold in the age of social media, with the pioneer LendingClub getting its start on Facebook in 2007. The concept is simple: Instead of requiring someone with a business plan \\\\u2014 be it a startup, a product, or a real-estate investment \\\\u2014 to go to a bank or large investor for cash to get their idea off the ground, the investment can be collectively funded by small investors.\\\\u00a0The most well-known version is reward crowdfunding, most commonly seen on Kickstarter, where someone with an idea for a gadget asks for startup money and then provides these early investors with a reward, usually the product itself, once it\\'s created.Another form of crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding, works a bit like the stock market without the onerous and expensive process of initial public offerings. An asset, be it a company, a piece of real estate, or even an expensive artwork, is split into shares. Small-time investors can then purchase a share of the asset and split the spoils.In the case of PeerStreet, investors purchase a note that operates like a mortgage tied to (in most cases) a residential investment property. As long as the property owner can pay the mortgage, the investor gets a monthly payout proportional to their share.Launched in 2013, PeerStreet quickly grew a stellar reputation among the burgeoning crowdfunding community, but the quality of deals on the platform noticeably declined as its popularity grew, said Ian Ippolito, the founder of the Real Estate Crowdfunding Review, a website that researches real-estate crowdfunding platforms.According to Ippolito, it\\'s a common story: A crowdfunding company grows in popularity to the point where deals are fully funded in 30 minutes or less, prompting it to increase the number of deals on the platform. Skyrocketing demand for deals comes with \\\\\"a temptation to reduce the underwriting,\\\\\" he said.\\\\u00a0PeerStreet didn\\'t respond to requests for comment, but its executives have made no bones about its ambition to function as a \\\\\"two-sided marketplace,\\\\\" instead of as an investment manager. Marketplaces, which merely connect buyers to sellers, do better as more volume flows through them, which means the incentive is for more investments, not necessarily high-quality ones. This is true for many real-estate crowdfunders, whether they sell notes attached to debt or shares of an equity investment.\\\\\"If you get up to a cruising altitude with a whole bunch of developers up there, it\\'s impossible for them to do the due diligence,\\\\\" said John McNellis, a principal and cofounder of the development group McNellis Partners and an author of a best-selling book on real-estate development.He said the up-for-grabs investment pitch of many crowdfunding companies was: \\\\\"This is up on our website. It may or may not suck as an investment. Make your own decision.\\\\\"Perhaps not coincidentally, the rise in demand for deals often coincides with capital infusions from venture capitalists, further fueling the cycle and leading to even more deterioration in the underwriting standards, industry insiders including a former crowdfunding founder said.Burry was an early PeerStreet investor and vouched for the company\\'s credit quality in 2015, when it was still in startup mode. By 2016, the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz was also backing the company. By 2019, PeerStreet had raised $121.9 million in venture funding and surpassed $3 billion in total loans funded. (It had hit the $2 billion benchmark only a year earlier after five years in business.) The company\\'s meteoric growth continued amid the pandemic, but loan volume collapsed as interest rates rose.The collapse has revealed deeper issues, including a massive number of loans in or near default. A mind-boggling 54% of the company\\'s loans were more than 30 days delinquent as of the bankruptcy, a fact pulled from court documents that drew gasps from industry insiders when discussing PeerStreet with Insider.Ippolito and McNellis said crowdfunding companies were never in line to get the best deals anyway because those tended to be reserved for the banks or institutional investors, which have higher underwriting standards. The focus on quantity exacerbated the situation, resulting in a flood of low-quality deals.\\\\\"They call it democratizing real estate. I call it shearing sheep,\\\\\" McNellis added, explaining his view that the crowdfunding industry was regularly taking advantage of Main Street investors.PeerStreet\\'s bankruptcy is also testing a fundamental principle of crowdfunding: It gives small investors a chance to own assets, whether it\\'s a piece of a company or a mortgage loan.Bankruptcy filings show that the El Segundo, California, company is arguing that it controls the loans and should therefore be allowed to sell them at auction to pay off its creditors. PeerStreet\\'s lawyers have pointed to language in the investment agreement that says the notes sold on its platform are unsecured. Instead of a fraction of a mortgage backed by real estate, they\\'re a financial instrument that acts as a fraction of a mortgage secured by nothing.More than 50 investors have sent letters to the judge, the vast majority saying they believe they\\'re secured investors. They have also argued that they should have a right to decide what happens to their investments. The investors who spoke with Insider said they wanted to ride the loans to term in hopes that they could recoup their investments.\\\\u00a0The site\\'s users have cited the company\\'s marketing, such as a post on the company\\'s website that says the notes PeerStreet offers are first-lien loans \\\\\"sitting at the safest part of the capital stack.\\\\\" The post adds: \\\\\"This position is the least risky because these investors will be the first in line to get paid, and take priority to junior debt and equity in the event of default or foreclosure.\\\\\" In conversations with Insider, some investors also cited a Burry quote in a press release from 2015 that said: \\\\\"PeerStreet\\'s notes are backed by real estate.\\\\\"Burry declined to comment for our story, but bankruptcy filings show that he, too, has a lot to lose. In addition to his investment in the company, he was a user of the site with over $600,000 in investments and about $9,000 in cash in his PeerStreet account.The largest investor on PeerStreet\\'s platform, Pacific Funding Trust, which owned just under one-quarter of the notes on the platform, has also filed an objection to PeerStreet\\'s effort to sell the loans, claiming that the notes it purchased were actually pieces of the loans.\\\\u00a0In an August 4 hearing, the bankruptcy judge halted PeerStreet\\'s plan to sell until the question of ownership was resolved, noting both the Pacific Funding objection and the letters from smaller investors. Silverstein, the judge, said the case was extraordinarily complex and that the dispute would take time to figure out.One of PeerStreet\\'s lawyers tried to push the sale forward, arguing that the judge could authorize the sale before figuring out ownership. The judge disagreed.\\\\\"If you don\\'t own them, you can\\'t sell them,\\\\\" Silverstein said.The PeerStreet investors who spoke with Insider said the outcome of this case could determine whether they stick with real-estate crowdfunding. The next hearing on the question of ownership has been scheduled for Wednesday.\\\\\"If they allow PeerStreet to confiscate my investment that they promised wouldn\\'t be confiscated, I don\\'t see why anyone would crowdfund anything ever again,\\\\\" Sean Quinn, a PeerStreet investor and retired labor-relations executive, said.Doug Lyon, an engineering professor at Fairfield University and an investor on many crowdfunding platforms, told Insider he planned to continue investing on other platforms but not PeerStreet, even if it successfully emerged from bankruptcy.\\\\\"This is where money goes to die,\\\\\" Lyon said of the site.Real-estate crowdfunding tends to be restricted to investors with at least $1 million in net worth, not including their home, or $200,000 a year in income. As a result, some investors have hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, according to the bankruptcy court letters.According to Ippolito, unsecured instruments are common in the debt-crowdfunding world, which PeerStreet helped pioneer. One of the largest crowdfunding platforms, Yieldstreet, uses a similar form of note that\\'s not directly tied to the underlying loan, Ippolito found in an analysis of the company\\'s investment agreement.Patch of Land operated with a similar note structure before it paused originations in 2020 and let the loans run to term as it moved away from crowdfunding, according to CEO Jason Fritton. The company was eventually sold, and the platform wound down.To be sure, platforms that offer equity instead of debt tend to provide investors with a true piece of the asset, instead of a note. They do this by creating an entity known as a special-purpose vehicle to buy the property. Then investors receive shares in the actual entity proportional to the amount of money they invested and therefore should have more autonomy in the case of bankruptcy.Of course, equity holders are often the first to get wiped out in a bankruptcy.PeerStreet investors also take issue with the company\\'s past representations about how it would handle a bankruptcy if one ever needed to be filed. In a post on its website, PeerStreet wrote that its investments were held in a \\\\\"bankruptcy-remote entity\\\\\" and that in the \\\\\"unlikely event PeerStreet no longer remains in business,\\\\\" a third party would come in to manage the investments \\\\\"and ensure that investors continue to receive interest and principal payments.\\\\\"Instead, the company froze all payments to investors and lobbied the court to let it sell the loans to satisfy its debts. While some of that money could make its way back to investors, the amount is unclear, bankruptcy experts said.\\\\u00a0The company has argued that it would sell the loans in tranches of similarly performing loans and then pass the proceeds to noteholders after calculating each investor\\'s holding to limit losses.\\\\u00a0But investors said the company could just as easily put the proceeds of any sale into one big pot to pay off its debts in order of seniority. In that case, the platform\\'s noteholders would be below the hedge-fund company Magnetar Capital, which is owed $27 million, lawyers, and even real-estate brokers, bankruptcy experts said.\\\\u00a0Kirk Brett, the chair of Adler & Stachenfeld\\'s bankruptcy group, which is not involved in the PeerStreet bankruptcy, said the question of distributions could play out in various ways, including the big-pot scenario investors said they feared.\\\\u00a0\\\\\"I don\\'t think that has been addressed in cases before, and you can tell that because there\\'s not a lot of case-law citations on the issue in the filings,\\\\\" Brett said.\\\\u00a0The real-estate-crowdfunding industry is littered with allegations of faulty controls.\\\\u00a0In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the CEO and founder of iFunding and another corporate officer of misappropriating more than $1.17 million in investor funds and making fraudulent statements to investors. In 2021, the two men were ordered to fork over more than $2 million in fines and restitution after admitting to the SEC\\'s allegations.More recently, CrowdStreet has come under scrutiny after it raised $53.8 million for two deals that never closed, prompting an investigation in Delaware bankruptcy court. In July, the fiduciary tapped to review the matter said the money had been \\\\\"misappropriated,\\\\\" with much of it transferred to entities connected to the CEO of the developer, Nightingale\\'s Elie Schwartz.\\\\u00a0CrowdStreet has responded by blaming Nightingale and said that it was assessing legal actions against Schwartz and Nightingale. Nightingale has not responded to the allegations, but its lawyer told the court the company was working on a settlement with investors after the fiduciary revealed that the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission were looking into the matter.\\\\u00a0Meanwhile, the SEC on Tuesday charged Yieldstreet, one of the largest crowdfunding platforms, with $728.5 million raised, with misleading investors. The SEC said the company did not disclose to investors that the borrowers of a $14.5 million project to take apart a ship had previously failed to repay similar loans to Yieldstreet entities. Investors lost millions.Yieldstreet agreed to pay more than $1.9 million without admitting or denying wrongdoing. In a statement to Insider, the company said it continued \\\\\"to aggressively pursue recovery for our investors through ongoing litigation and collection efforts both here and abroad.\\\\\"Ippolito told Insider that the industry, which used to have hundreds of operators, had been whittled down to roughly 20 platforms over the past decade.\\\\u00a0Some, such as Yieldstreet, have broadened their operations to other alternative assets, including art and private credit, which has become a highly lucrative pocket of commercial real estate as banks retreat from lending. Some operators have consolidated. Others have wound down their operations. Others, such as Fundrise, have moved away from crowdfunding in favor of a model for private real-estate investment trusts, similar to the BREIT later offered by Blackstone.Fritton, the former Patch of Land CEO, said Fundrise\\'s fund model was the wave of the future for real-estate crowdfunding. There\\'s a large appetite from accredited investors to put money into real-estate deals, but a fund structure can offer more protection for both the sponsor and the investors.A marketplace of individual investments prioritizes the quantity of investments, but a fund requires the sponsor to operate like a more-traditional investment manager, which ideally leads to tighter underwriting standards.\\\\u00a0Funds are also better able to weather the inevitable but random operating expenses that pop up when you\\'re dealing with physical investments, such as a broken elevator or water heater or repairs after flooding. Instead of requiring each individual property to keep enough money on hand to deal with these eventualities, a fund can hold a much-larger amount of cash across all its properties that can be used whenever these issues arise. This means there\\'s much less chance that the sponsor will have to go back to investors to ask for more capital to complete a necessary repair.\\\\u00a0Funds can also protect individual investors from getting wiped out if a single investment goes south, Fritton said. If investors pour all their money into the one deal that fails, they lose it all, but if they pour it into a fund, one deal failing won\\'t make their entire investment evaporate. \\\\\"No matter how well you underwrite,\\\\\" Fritton said, some deals fail.Fritton gave the example of one deal that looked perfect on paper: The sponsor was the CEO of a publicly traded company with a large amount of experience and fantastic credit. It was the company\\'s first payment default.\\\\\"He never paid us a dime on that loan,\\\\\" Fritton said.\", \"label\": \"Real Estate, BI Prime, Startups, Finance, Investing, Real Estate, Mortgage\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/problem-with-real-estate-crowdfunding-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"Visa Is Rolling Out GPT-4 to Employees As It Goes All-in on AI\", \"date\": \"2023-09-14 18:48:52+00:00\", \"content\": \"It\\'s been three decades since Visa introduced AI to its tech stack, but by the end of the year, there won\\'t be a job or position that doesn\\'t incorporate the technology.\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0Visa relies on AI for mission-critical tasks like processing payments, detecting fraud, and securing its massive network infrastructure.

It aims to roll it out to the rest of its workforce by year-end.Taneja himself used it recently to revamp a job posting for an AI role, using ChatGPT to rewrite the job description, draft interview questions based on the position, and then ask the AI for the ideal answers.Visa continues to experiment with similar AI models, like Meta\\'s AI model Llama 2 and those from French-American company Hugging Face, Taneja said.Visa\\'s engineers are leveraging AI to write code, and while it\\'s not perfect, more AI-generated code is being used each week, with about half of the code being approved in some cases. The idea is that engineers will direct and supervise models and use them as an \\\\\"assistant coder,\\\\\" somebody who never forgets anything, who is trained on the latest technologies, and who continues to know more every single day, Taneja said.Not only will AI change how Visa employees work, but it\\'ll push the firm to grow its headcount too. There are more than 2,500 technologists who build Visa\\'s data and AI platforms and services, but the firm will look to hire 2,000 more people in the next few years to carry out its AI road map.Even though Visa first used AI in 1993, it wasn\\'t until 2014 that Visa rebuilt its core data platform and started applying AI across the business and to maintain operations.Every second, Visa processes up to 76,000 transactions.

It uses AI to continuously upgrade its tech stack, with Visa making a thousand software changes and updates on some days.It protects cardholders against criminals signing into their accounts through AI by knowing how a specific customer types in their user ID and password. Biometric behavioral analytics will trigger AI to step up authentication if the models think someone other than the customer is typing in the credentials, even if the ID and password are correct and the IP address and device are recognized, Taneja said.\\\\u00a0AI has been indispensable for Visa to offer clients and customers reassurance and reliability, Taneja said. \\\\\"If someone is buying a subway ticket or paying for groceries or buying medicine or having a cup of coffee, then in the event there is a problem going on, Visa\\'s AI systems will continue to work in a way that prevents fraud, catches counterfeits, and catches any ATM withdrawal attacks,\\\\\" he added.\", \"label\": \"Finance, BI Prime, Generative AI, ChatGPT, Visa, Payments, Fintech\", \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-visa-uses-ai-for-cybersecurity-employees-chatgpt-2023-9\"}, {\"title\": \"The Latest News, Headlines, and Business Stories for September 14\", \"date\": \"2023-09-14 11:51:34+00:00\", \"content\": \"Almost to the weekend!

Insider\\'s Jennifer Sor has more on the reorg, deemed by CEO Jane Fraser as the most consequential change to Citigroup in nearly 20 years. Citigroup is pitching the move as a way to simplify its structure. Case in point: Fraser said the changes eliminated 35 committees.Changes like these are bound to ruffle some feathers, but Fraser isn\\'t bothered by it. The reorg will \\\\\"make some of our people very uncomfortable,\\\\\" but the CEO said she\\'s \\\\\"absolutely fine with that.\\\\\"That might seem like a harsh stance, but understand the bank needs tough love. Citigroup\\'s share price is down nearly 40% since Fraser took over as CEO in March 2021. To be fair, Fraser\\'s tenure has been an uphill battle. She inherited plenty of headaches from her predecessor, Michael Corbat. That included the bank accidentally wiring $900 million, which is the type of thing that\\'s typically frowned upon in banking.But two-plus years later, problems persist. Before the announcement, the bank\\'s share price was down almost 9% this year, trailing all of its fellow big bank peers in the US except Bank of America.Citi\\'s overhaul represents how big banks are scrambling to stay on top of a financial world passing them by. When news of Citi\\'s reorg broke, I immediately thought of Goldman Sachs. The prestigious investment bank has also grabbed headlines for its multiple reorgs amid a failed push into consumer banking under CEO David Solomon.Meanwhile, my colleague Rebecca Ungarino pointed out that Wells Fargo has faced continued setbacks from a slew of fines over the years as CEO Charlie Scharf continues to work to right the ship.Even the big bank having the best year \\\\u2014 JPMorgan \\\\u2014 isn\\'t completely happy.

The chairman of the financial giant Citibank and its parent corporation, Citicorp, he was also a man with a vision. Wriston was a globalist who was deeply influenced by economist Friedrich Hayek\\'s vision of a world in which market freedoms were the basis of individual liberty. Look closely at the burgeoning of international finance, of information networks, of logistical innovations that transformed trade. You\\'ll find Wriston everywhere.\\\\u00a0Wriston\\'s financial innovations helped create the modern Eurodollar market \\\\u2014 a vast offshore realm of financial transactions in US dollars happening outside of US borders. His efforts to build a private global payments system under Citibank\\'s control in the early 1970s prompted other banks to build their own collective system, so as to avoid being drawn inside Citibank\\'s gently smiling jaws.Wriston\\'s willingness to put his ideas into action changed the world. As he explained in 1979, the \\\\\"current banking network, with its Euromarkets and its automated payments system\\\\\" seemed dull and technical, but it had immense political consequences. He believed that if money could move rapidly from country to country, it could no longer be mastered by nations. Instead it might master them, replacing the whimsical tyranny of political rulers with the austere rigor of market discipline.But the tragedy of globalization was that men and women like Wriston built a world that seemed to escape the control of government but in fact was wide open to government power and its own undoing.At the beginning of Wriston\\'s career, in the 1960s, international banking barely existed. It was sluggish, timid, and lazy. Banks were trapped inside national borders by complex and clashing rules put in place after the financial crash of the Great Depression. These regulations meant that most banks faced little international competition and had scant incentive to invest in new ways of doing things. It was nearly impossible to be a true international bank.The 1960s banking industry was a Victorian relic in the modern era, a clattering steampunk engine of rusting pistons and gutta-percha-covered cables, with a few incongruously modern parts bolted on. Eric Sepkes, who helped build the European payments system, later recalled how Citibank\\'s London operation relied on a system of pneumatic tubes to communicate between the office that initiated the payments to clients \\\\u2014 borrowers, business, brokers \\\\u2014 and the office that authorized those payments. Staff had to handwrite payment instructions on a form, which they then stuffed into a canister and inserted into a partial vacuum conduit that ferried it to its destination where the authorizes would then release the funds (the City of London had built miles of pneumatic tube networks in the nineteenth century). One day, when the payments people didn\\'t hear back from authorization, they discovered that the tube had become blocked. Citibank had to call in a chimney sweep to fix the problem, re-enabling payments processing for the entire continent of Europe.Global banking was a system of mysterious tubes on a much larger scale, with various portals that took money in, did expensive and incomprehensible things to it, and spat it out somewhere else. No one fully understood the machinery, least of all the people who were supposedly in charge. The gentlemanly activities of merchant banking, where men with excellent pedigrees built on their social connections to win deals, remained rigidly distinct from the mundane tasks of payments processing, which were performed by female clerks surrounded by vast piles of paper. It took a very long time to send money across borders. At one point, inflation in Argentina was rising so rapidly that Citibank\\'s branch in the country had to convert its profits into cases of Scotch whisky to prevent the value of the income from being inflated away before they could be sent to New York.Wriston helped rebuild this clanking machine into an engine of transformation, welding disjointed national markets into a true world economy. His strategy was built around two insights. The first was that global markets could \\\\u2014 if they were allowed \\\\u2014 circumvent the labyrinthine systems of rules constructed by national regulators and eventually replace them. The second was that banking was a \\\\\"branch of the information business.\\\\\"\\\\u00a0Market prices provided one crucial source of information, summarizing as they did the decisions of millions of individuals over what to buy and sell. Technology provided another, allowing banks to discover the information they had buried within their own bureaucracies and to better exchange information with each other and their customers. With proper technology, the dull-seeming backroom activities of banking such as payments processing could become a source of profit and power.When Wriston began to remake Citibank, money had already begun to seep through the seams in the ductwork. Businesses outside the United States desperately wanted US dollars, which were needed, for example, to buy and sell oil, while businesses in the United States wanted to earn higher returns. US regulators had capped interest rates for ordinary consumers and stopped interest payments altogether on corporate deposits, limiting the profits many stateside banks could earn. Bankers had already begun to figure out crafty means to connect overseas dollar demand to American supply.Wriston and his colleagues built the institutional infrastructures that allowed this to happen at scale. They created financial instruments like the certificate of deposit, which provided a legal pipeline to smoothly convey the dollars owned by American businesses to the international banks that needed them for their customers. Citibank\\'s competitors, like JPMorgan and Warburg, adapted these instruments and came up with their own ideas. What was once a small and disconnected trade in Eurodollars, based primarily in London, became a vast marketplace for buying, selling, and lending in dollars outside the United States.As the political economist Eric Helleiner describes it, the Eurodollar market became a legal gray zone where vast amounts of US dollars circulated beyond US borders. As the market grew, the US dollar became established as the universal basis of international trade. If you were a Japanese company selling goods to a business in Italy, it was hard to convert the Italian lira that you were paid in directly into Japanese yen. The economic relationship between Japan and Italy wasn\\'t big enough to support a liquid market where the two currencies could be exchanged directly. The Eurodollar market provided an easy detour, where you could turn lira into dollars and then dollars into yen. And as the supply of Eurodollars grew, it increasingly made sense for companies to simply buy and sell in dollars, which they could then convert into their home currencies.The result was that the dollar became a global currency, without anyone really planning it. More dollars circulated outside the United States than within it. US officials at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere paid surprisingly little official attention to what was happening. This made the market attractive, for example, to the Soviet Union, which needed dollars for international trade but worried that they might be seized by the US government if they were deposited directly in American banks. By using Eurodollars, which were bought and sold in London and Italy, they thought they could avoid this risk.These markets all depended on an infrastructure of clever financial engineering. Banks weren\\'t trading physical stacks of hundred-dollar bills. Looked at closely, Eurodollars were an accounting fiction, imaginary dollars traded between real banks. They couldn\\'t be used for anything other than buying other currencies. But every single Eurodollar had to be backed by a real dollar, sitting in a US bank operating under US law and responsible to US regulators. As Wriston explained, \\\\\"All the dollars in the world \\\\u2014 except [physical] currency \\\\u2014 are deposits in a bank in America, because that is the only place anyone can spend a dollar.\\\\\"This meant that transactions using Eurodollars had to be cleared through a US bank\\'s internal processes (moving money from one customer\\'s account to another\\'s) or through a clearing institution run by US banks, such as CHIPS, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System. Foreign banks had to maintain clearing accounts in US financial institutions if they were to trade dollars and participate in global finance. The Eurodollar market might indeed have been a pirate kingdom, but it was one where the buccaneers had to regularly provision themselves in the monarch\\'s ports. The more that foreign banks came to depend on access to US dollars, the more vulnerable they were to US regulators, whenever those regulators finally woke up.Gradually, the \\\\\"dollar clearing system\\\\\" run by US banks like Citibank and JPMorgan and clearing institutions like CHIPS became the beating heart of the world\\'s financial system, circulating dollars around the world in a regular systole and diastole. The Eurodollar market, far from creating a decentered new realm of finance, had made the global financial system more fragile and more vulnerable to American jurisdiction.Wriston had hoped to build a world where business, not government, was in charge. He and his peers helped markets spill over the confines of national borders into each other, a confluence that grew into a world ocean of information, money, and production. But even if business leaders like Wriston did not aspire to become sovereigns, they wanted to build their own business empires.\\\\u00a0In 1998, Helleiner wrote a skeptical riposte to Wriston\\'s vision. It wasn\\'t just that Eurodollar markets existed on the sufferance of governments and would have withered if the United States had not let them flourish. It was that global finance was \\\\\"increasingly concentrated\\\\\" in great financial centers like New York and London where electronic money had to pass through various \\\\\"central \\'choke points.\\'\\\\\"As Helleiner speculated, this might actually increase the power of governments like the United States rather than undermining it. The question was when these governments would take up their power, and what they would do when they did.Within a couple of weeks of the September 11 attack, Helleiner\\'s predictions began to become a reality. The US Department of the Treasury started to aggressively investigate its options for gathering financial data from the world, so that it could detect future attacks. One of the key areas to watch, the Treasury found, was the flow of dollars around the world. It began to develop a new kind of sanction, which used its control of \\\\\"dollar clearing\\\\\" to force international banks to implement US policy outside its borders. The SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) messaging system \\\\u2014 which plays a core role in global financial transfers \\\\u2014 and dollar clearing were combined to cut Iran out of the world\\'s financial system, forcing it to the negotiating table to discuss its nuclear weapons program.\\\\u00a0The US officials who planned these steps often thought of them as once-off emergency measures. But in the years to come, the US government would repeatedly exercise its power over the dollar to exact a financial toll on its geopolitical adversaries \\\\u2014 including, most recently, its sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Instead of the stateless, government-less world that Wriston envisioned, the internationalization of the US dollar became the precedent for a massive transformation of America\\'s financial power.Henry Farrell\\\\u00a0is the SNF Agora Professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS, the 2019 winner of the Friedrich Schiedel Prize for Politics and Technology, Editor-in-Chief of The Monkey Cage at The Washington Post, and co-founder of the popular academic blog, Crooked Timber.Abraham Newman\\\\u00a0is a professor at the School of Foreign Service and Government Department at Georgetown University.Excerpted from UNDERGROUND EMPIRE: How America Weaponized the World Economy by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman.

Saudi Arabia sparked international outrage in 2018 after Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and continues to face accusations of human rights violations.Despite this, little has been able to stop Saudi Arabia from exerting more and more influence on the global stage.It\\'s opened its purse strings to direct billions of dollars towards everything from sports to media and entertainment as part of an international spending spree aimed at helping it diversify beyond oil.All this makes Saudi Arabia a country more relevant than ever. Here\\'s a closer look at everything from its GDP to employment in the Gulf Kingdom.Like many countries, Saudi Arabia\\'s economy suffered when the pandemic struck in 2020, but the only way has been up since then.It GDP soared past $1 trillion last year for the first time, while per- capita output stood at $30,436, up about 50% in just two years, according to World Bank data.The growth phase, which secured the kingdom\\'s spot as the G20\\'s fastest-growing economy last year, was fueled by higher global energy prices as well as a 4.8% non-oil GDP growth thanks to a boom in areas such as construction and transport, per the IMF.Saudi Arabia may be trying to reduce its reliance on oil revenues as part of its Vision 2030 plan for a diversified economy, but it\\'s clear that crude still calls the shots for the world\\'s top exporter.An 8.7% economic expansion last year was driven by higher oil prices. Saudi Aramco, the majority state-owned oil major that raised $25.6 billion in its 2019 IPO, made record profit of $161 billion last year, up from $110 billion in 2021.Despite the resilience of oil demand even with the rise of renewable energy, Saudi Arabia\\'s wants to increase the share of non-oil exports in non-oil GDP from 18.7% to 50%.Both at home and far away, Saudi Arabia hasn\\'t shied away from investing boatloads of cash. The investments are primarily led by the Public Investment Fund, the state\\'s powerful sovereign wealth fund led by MBS and fund governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan.It\\'s the investment vehicle behind splashy deals in sports such as Saudi Arabia\\'s takeover of Newcastle United and the LIV Golf merger with the PGA Tour, to being the driving force behind Saudi Arabia\\'s domestic investments in giga-projects like NEOM and the Red Sea resort.In August, the fund disclosed assets under management surpassed 2.23 trillion riyals ($594 billion) in 2022, Reuters reported. Almost a quarter of those assets were international.Saudi\\'s population is young and growing. The total hit 32.2 million in May with a median age of 29, according to Saudi Arabia\\'s General Authority for Statistics.The population has increased by a third in 13 years and more than half of Saudis are under 30, according to a 2022 census reported by Reuters.The high proportion of young people attempting to enter the workforce is one of the MBS\\'s biggest challenges. The prince has been attempting to diversify the economy and create opportunities for young workers.Saudi Arabia, along with several other countries in the Arab States region, is a key destination for foreign nationals. Just over 40% of the kingdom\\'s total population are non-Saudis, per Reuters.The country has been heavily reliant on migrant labor for some time, with many employed in sectors such as agriculture and domestic service industries. The country has faced criticism from international groups about its treatment of migrant workers including the exclusions from some protections under national labor law.The unemployment rate was 5.1% in the first quarter of this year, according to estimates based on an official labor force survey. The country\\'s average overall employment participation rate was 61.7% \\\\u2013 52.4% for Saudi nationals and 75.2% for non-Saudis.Saudi women are also less likely to be working, with the unemployment rate for those aged 25 to 54 at 15.7% compared to just 3.5% for men in the same age bracket.The Arab Gulf economies share similar characteristics and are all heavily reliant on oil or gas revenue.While Saudi Arabia was the world\\'s fastest-growing G20 economy last year, fellow Gulf states Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates registered rapid growth as well.The kingdom registered the largest overall GDP in the Arab League last year.Its record-setting $1 trillion economy was more than double the size of the UAE.
