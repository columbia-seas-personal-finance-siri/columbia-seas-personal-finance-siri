It is now three acts, an evolution of reassessed expectations and redefined goals. Longer life expectancies, and the health care costs that come with them, should be top of mind.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.Running out of money in retirement tops the list of concerns for clients. Nearly 73% of RBC Wealth Management clients surveyed said they worry about outliving their assets, while 62% said they were concerned about the cost of health care and long-term care.Being too cautious and spending too little during your working years might needlessly restrict your lifestyle. But spending too much and not taking longevity into account increases your risks in retirement. Planning for the post-work years is a balancing act, but you can set yourself up for success by considering how you will spend your time and money during those three phases.Leaving a life focused around a career represents a major transition. While taking a break from the workaday world may be a relief, you may find yourself wanting to continue an active lifestyle.Along with travel and renewed interest in a hobby, more Baby Boomers realize the importance of being involved during retirement, which could mean traveling, volunteering with charitable organizations or even taking on childcare duties with grandkids.This means their spending is equal to or, in some instances, higher than what it was when they were working. Some decide to continue working on a reduced scale to keep busy or stretch their dollars in retirement. Before making that choice, consider the following.Heading into your 70s, you will likely still be \u201con the go,\u201d but it\u2019s reasonable to expect the pace of life beginning to slow down.At this phase, retirees are staying closer to home, starting to downsize their lifestyles and spending less \u2014 less on cars, less on homes, less on travel. They are leading a simpler and thus more inexpensive lifestyle.Besides health care, housing is one of the most expensive pieces of the retirement puzzle. Not only is it a large expense, for many it represents a significant and often overlooked asset. To think about retirement without having a serious conversation about housing is a mistake.Consider the following housing choices when developing your plan:As you reach your 80s and 90s, another major shift in focus often occurs: spending less money on activities like travel and hobbies and more on the essentials of life.The challenge in these years isn\u2019t normal monthly expenses \u2014 it\u2019s planning for health care, including the possibility of moving to a retirement village or nursing home. Preparing in advance for this stage of life is critical.Annual out-of-pocket health care expenses, on average, are nearly triple for an 85-year-old couple compared to a 65-year-old couple, according to a 2021 HealthView Services report.While most don\u2019t like to think about it, long-term care and its costs are no longer something we can ignore. Seventy percent of 65-year-olds will need some form of long-term care, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The national annual median cost for a private room in a nursing home is $108,405, with the average length of stay at 2\u00bd years.Consider the following health and long-term care pieces as you set up your plan:For couples, having a survivor benefit plan is also important. Often the survivor will have greater care needs as they age without the support of the spouse.How confident are you that you're truly prepared for what retirement may throw your way?The answer may lie in having a comprehensive wealth plan in place. Eighty-four percent of RBC Wealth Management clients surveyed who have a wealth plan are confident about retirement, while the same is true for only 45% of those without a plan.It makes sense. Those who worked with a financial adviser and created a wealth plan have fewer concerns and generally are less likely to be blindsided by a change in direction that can easily occur over the course of a long retirement.A solid retirement plan, created thoughtfully and managed over time, can help you prepare for unexpected changes in your life and give you the freedom to identify solutions to suit your lifestyle as your circumstances change in your three acts of retirement.This article was written by and presents the views of our contributing adviser, not the Kiplinger editorial staff.

The remarkable rally of 2023 lost steam a couple of months ago amid mounting anxieties over everything from interest rates and bond yields to rising oil prices and the outlook for global growth. The S&P 500 is still up more than 11% on a price basis so far this year, but sentiment has shifted since the benchmark index hit its 2023 peak at the end of July.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.Indeed, the S&P 500 is down about 7% since then, with fears of a government shutdown weighing on the index as we approach Washington's weekend deadline.\u00a0Throwing a potential government shutdown into the mix when markets were already struggling during the seasonally weakest month of the year for equities is less than ideal. Whether stocks can get back on track for a fourth-quarter push very much remains to be seen. A government shutdown certainly can't help matters, the thinking goes.Happily, for market participants, the historical record for stocks when the federal government shuts down is far from one of doom and gloom.\u00a0There have been 21 government shutdowns since 1976, but on only four occasions were operations affected for more than one business day, writes Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. That leaves us with only four \"true\" shutdowns, Buchbinder notes, the last occurring in late 2018 into early 2019.\u00a0It's tough to remember now, but the S&P 500 returned 10.3% during the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019. Stocks did fine during the extended shutdown of October 2013 too.\"Historically, markets were not materially impacted by a shutdown,\" Buchbinder says. \"For example, in 2013, the House and Senate were in a standoff over funding for the so-called Affordable Care Act and the government was shut down for 16 days during the first part of October. The S&P 500 had some down days but overall, the equity market took all the political drama in stride with a 3.1% advance during those 16 days.\"It's sort of counterintuitive, but during the 21 government shutdowns, the S&P 500 rose 55% of the time, generating an average return of 0.3%, according to data from Carson Group. Even better, 12 months after the end of the shutdown, the S&P 500 was higher 86% of the time, with an average return of 12.7%.\u00a0Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but the record for stocks in government shutdowns is almost encouraging. When the last federal government shutdown ended in 2019, the S&P 500 went on to return almost 24% over the next 12 months. There are probably plenty of market participants who would take that deal again.\u00a0", "label": "https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/what-does-a-government-shutdown-mean-for-stocks"}, {"title": "Deferring Taxes Until Retirement? You May Want to Reconsider | Kiplinger", "date": "2023-09-28 09:40:20+00:00", "content": "Conventional wisdom about putting money in qualified accounts (401(k), 403(b) and IRA are examples) for decades has been to defer your tax liability on those assets for as long as possible and get growth in those accounts unhindered by taxes. If you can wait and pay Uncle Sam later, why pay him now?As the qualified accounts grow, so does the tax liability \u2014 along with the future pressure that required minimum distributions (RMDs) may cause related to where you end up in tax brackets and Medicare premium surcharges.The reality is that if tax rates go up, deferring is not likely helpful and may actually be harmful. If you have a known tax liability today (that\u2019s fairly low by historical standards), settling that liability is not always a bad idea.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.The risk of deferring taxes well into the future is the uncertainty. Tax rates down the road are up in the air, but you can probably count on the word \u201cup.\u201d They are relatively low now, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which expires at the end of 2025. Taxes can go up in the future in at least a few ways. (They can go down or stay the same also, but few believe that will happen.)First, for many people, tax rates can increase starting in 2026 if Congress doesn\u2019t extend the rules currently in place, and who knows how high they might go in subsequent years as many continue to retire? When Uncle Sam comes calling in your retirement (RMDs and Medicare premiums included), you\u2019ll likely want more control and less tax burden whenever possible.Second, many retirees may face tax increases for other reasons. Death of a spouse is one. Divorce can be another. Either circumstance can put a person into a single-tax-filing status whereas they previously filed jointly.Further, taxes could also go up if Congress chooses to raise rates to address the spending that seems to continue to spiral.Here are some other issues to consider.Too many people, because they want to limit as much as possible the amount of tax they will pay in a given year, will not sell a stock that has appreciated significantly and will allow greater and greater concentration in an individual stock. That is an example of letting \u201cthe tax tail wag the dog.\u201dWhen it comes to investment returns, your focus should be on managing risk and thinking in terms of net gains after taxes and on limiting your taxes in retirement. Again, this is about considering settling a liability at a reasonable tax rate rather than at a rate that is likely to be higher in the future. Just like ordinary income tax rates can increase in the future, so, too, can capital gains tax rates.Pay attention to tax location when looking at your investments. What does that mean? You do not have to have your qualified accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s) invested the same way as your non-qualified accounts (those that don\u2019t receive \u201cpreferential\u201d tax treatment).Example: Let\u2019s say I am retired and have $1 million in a traditional IRA and decide to withdraw $50,000 from that IRA. That withdrawal will be taxed as ordinary income, as is the case with all qualified accounts, no matter what I own in that account.But with a non-qualified account, how the money is taxed depends on what kind of investment asset I own. For instance, if I own a corporate bond, and I receive interest income on that bond, that is going to be taxed as ordinary income. But if I own a stock, and its value has increased significantly, all of that appreciation is capital gain and, if held for greater than 365 days, is treated as a long-term capital gain and not ordinary income. And under current law, capital gains taxation is generally better for the taxpayer than ordinary income taxation.So, consider owning things that generate ordinary income in accounts that, no matter what you own, are taxed as ordinary income, and own more capital-gain-oriented assets in accounts that can enjoy capital gains rates.It is beneficial to have assets that have the highest long-term growth potential in a Roth IRA. You don\u2019t get to defer taxes on the money you deposit in a Roth, but you do get growth tax-free and withdrawals tax-free. You\u2019re not going to be hit with taxes when you make withdrawals in retirement, which means you don\u2019t have to worry about those future tax rates.If you have a capital-gain-oriented asset (usually assets that have growth potential), such as a stock, the least advantageous thing you could do in terms of taxes is to invest in that stock through a qualified account. Again, that goes against conventional wisdom because everyone is told to defer, defer, defer, and you get to use the government\u2019s money \u2014 until it is time to pay the piper later.When you defer, all you are doing is expanding the liability. When you put $100,000 in a 401(k), you\u2019ve deferred taxes on that $100,000, but if it grows to $500,000 over many years, wonderful, you\u2019ve also got a tax liability on that $500,000 awaiting you. And if the tax rates are higher when you get to retirement, what you gained will be considerably less.Having a short-term mentality is not prudent when it comes to investing, nor is it when it comes to taxes. It is not the person who pays the least amount of taxes this year who wins. It is the person who thinks long-term and limits their long-term tax liability \u2014 and has a more enjoyable retirement because they did so.Dan Dunkin contributed to this article.The appearances in Kiplinger were obtained through a public relations program.

You\u2019re likely even getting unsolicited calls and emails. All kinds of health insurance brokers and companies want to dazzle you with their offerings.Yep, Medicare open enrollment starts soon. It\u2019s time to make sure you have the best plan or plans for you.\u00a0First, let\u2019s review the basics. As most retirees know, Medicare has several parts. Part A, which is offered at no cost, generally covers hospitalizations. Part B covers outpatient medical care. Part D is prescription drug coverage provided by private insurers.\u00a0Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.Medicare Advantage is the umbrella term for plans offered by private insurers regulated by Medicare to replace parts B and D. Medigap plans, also offered by private companies, are supplemental plans that cover copays and coinsurance charges imposed under Medicare Part B.While some people assume that Medicare will cover all their healthcare costs, experts warn that\u2019s not the case. A 65-year-old retiring this year can expect to spend an average of $157,500 in healthcare and medical expenses throughout retirement, according to data from Fidelity Investments. This highlights the importance of reviewing your Medicare plan choices during open enrollment each year to ensure you have the best coverage to meet your needs.Every year, Medicare\u2019s open enrollment period is October 15 to December 7. This is the time to enroll in or make changes to any Medicare or Medicare Advantage policies, although you may be restricted from making a change regarding a supplementary policy, or Medigap.There is another open enrollment period only for people with Medicare Advantage plans, from January 1 to March 31. During this January open enrollment, you can change from one Medicare Advantage plan to another or go back to original Medicare.\u00a0But while authorities urge an annual review of your coverage, you don\u2019t have to do anything if you\u2019re happy with what you have. If you want to maintain your current Medicare coverage, you do not need to re-enroll.While Part D plans can change the drugs they cover, and Medicare Advantage plans can change their provider networks as well as your costs and other provisions, less than one-third of enrollees are estimated to take advantage of open enrollment to compare plans and reevaluate their coverage.\u00a0Tim Smolen, director of the Washington State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIP), which helps residents navigate Medicare, says beneficiaries consistently care about three things during open enrollment: access, what benefits are included in their plan, and cost.\u00a0That last issue is the toughest to gauge. \u201cIt's very difficult to forecast in the year ahead how much health care you're going to use,\u201d he says.People who choose to keep traditional Medicare may also enroll in a supplemental medigap plan from a private insurer to cover costs like copays. Traditional Medicare, when not paired with Medigap, does not have a limit on out-of-pocket expenses in a year.\u00a0Medigap policies, which cannot be paired with Medicare Advantage plans, have standardized benefits. Most states offer 10 types of Medigap policies, but premiums vary by insurer. You can compare costs, benefits and availability on Medicare\u2019s website.\u00a0If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, you may switch to traditional Medicare, but you may have trouble getting a Medigap policy. Some states offer more protections than others, but, in general, your first time enrolling in Medicare is your best opportunity to get a Medigap policy.These plans have a monthly cost, in addition to the Part B premium, that varies depending on the plan. The plans frequently include prescription drug coverage and limits on annual out-of-pocket costs for covered services.\u00a0They also may offer extras not included by traditional Medicare, such as dental, hearing and vision coverage and gym memberships. They are able to do this because they manage costs, partly by limiting beneficiaries to in-network providers. During open enrollment, experts recommend checking to make sure your preferred providers remain in the network for your plan.\u00a0These plans have come under fire in recent years for their aggressive marketing tactics. Some beneficiaries have told of having good experiences with their Advantage plans until they get sick and find themselves fighting for coverage.\u00a0Sandy Leith, director of SHIP for Illinois, says advertisements for some plans set people up for failure, with important details hidden in fine print. Appeals for denied claims can be difficult to navigate. \u201cThey're getting away with a lot of misrepresentation and services that aren't up to par,\u201d Leith says.At press time, the government had not yet announced premium amounts for traditional Medicare for 2024.\u00a0The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) did say the average total monthly premium for Part D coverage is projected to be about $55.50, a decrease from $56.49 for 2023. That drop will likely be offset by an increase in premiums for Part B, which were expected to rise at least $15 a month.\u00a0According to CMS, the average monthly plan premium for all Medicare Advantage plans is projected to increase by 64 cents from $17.86 in 2023 to $18.50. If enrollees choose to stay in their plan, most will see little or no premium increase for next year, with nearly 73% of beneficiaries not seeing any premium increase.\u00a0People with higher income are charged higher Part B and D premiums \u2014 the income-related monthly adjustment amount, or IRMAA. In 2023, a single person with an income between $97,000 and $123,000 was charged $230.80 a month for Part B, compared to premiums of $164.90 for people who earned less. Your income for IRMAA purposes is calculated based on income two years before the plan year.\u00a0You can appeal your IRMAA if your income is significantly lower now than two years ago due to a life-changing event, such as retirement, divorce or death of a spouse, or if you think the government made a mistake. Beyond that, the only way to avoid the surcharge is to have less modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which includes all taxable income from work and investments, as well as the taxable portion of your Social Security.\u00a0Unfortunately, most popular deductions, such as charitable donations and mortgage interest, do not reduce your MAGI. However, withdrawals from Roth IRAs don\u2019t count toward your MAGI. If you\u2019re still working, you can contribute more toward tax-deferred retirement accounts to lower your income. Another option is to delay starting Social Security.\u00a0In general, you initially enroll in Medicare within three months before and three months after turning 65. Failing to do so can result in financial penalties, increasing your premiums for the rest of your life.\u00a0However, there are exceptions, including many people who receive health insurance through their employer or through their spouse\u2019s job, as long as the workplace has 20 or more employees. Be sure to check with your employer about how it handles your group health coverage at age 65.\u00a0Be warned of the \u201cCOBRA trap\u201d \u2014 insurance you may receive after you leave your job does not eliminate the requirement that you apply for Medicare at age 65.\u00a0The choices can seem overwhelming, and the marketing can be confusing and misleading. Fortunately, each state has unbiased experts who can walk you through the different plans and help you make sure your plans are the best for your needs. State Health Insurance Assistance Programs can be found through www.shiphelp.org or by calling 877-839-2675.

The agency would not award new contracts during a shutdown, but contracts already in place would continue.\u201cThe department will continue to defend the nation and conduct ongoing military operations,\u201d according to the DOD\u2019s plan. \u201cIt will continue activities funded with any available budgetary resources that have not lapsed, as well as excepted activities such as those necessary for the safety of human life and the protection of property.\u201dTens of thousands of other \u201cnon-essential\u201d federal workers from various agencies are also expected to be furloughed should there be a shutdown as some agencies partially close and some services reduced. Social Security would be impacted by a government shutdown, with 8,512 of its 61,869 workforce furloughed, but it would continue to send Social Security checks.Likewise, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid would be affected by a government shutdown but continue to provide essential services, albeit with a reduced staff. That means that in the event of a funding lapse, Medicare and Medicaid programs and services, including the sending of Medicare payments would continue.A government shutdown could also impact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which initially was expected to continue functioning as usual during a shutdown, but now reportedly may be partially shut with thousands of employees furloughed.The Department of Education (DOE) contingency plan, last updated in 2021, states that basic operations, including the servicing and disbursement of federal student loans and Pell Grants, could continue for a very limited time during a shutdown but that these operations could also experience some level of disruption.At a September 25 White House press conference, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked whether the Oct. 1 deadline for student loan repayments could be pushed back, given the looming shutdown. For now, people are expected to start paying student loans even in the event of a shutdown on October 1.Jean-Pierre responded that if the shutdown occurs, \u201cwe anticipate that key activities at Federal Student Aid will continue for a couple of weeks.\u201d However, if the shutdown lasts a few weeks, it \u201ccould substantially disrupt the return to repayment effort.\u201d", "label": "https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/how-government-shutdown-impacts-veterans"}, {"title": "What to Know When You Need a Business Loan | Kiplinger", "date": "2023-09-28 12:15:21+00:00", "content": "There are times when your business needs a cash injection. You may require a major piece of equipment, say, or have to cover expenses as you increase your employee count. Whatever the reason, borrowing money is something that might be necessary from time to time.But what exactly should you apply for? There\u2019s not just one type of loan appropriate for all businesses or purposes. Here\u2019s a quick guide to help demystify business loans and provide guidance on choosing the best one for your needs.\u00a0There are numerous types of loans available, and there are instances when one variety is more appropriate than others. I won\u2019t get into all of them, but here are some of the most common varieties to know about.Be a smarter, better informed investor.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail.Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail.First, there is the traditional business loan, also known as a term loan. With such loans, you contact a lender \u2014 either a bank or a private lender \u2014 and apply for a set amount of funds. These are then scheduled to be repaid over a certain time period. Getting a traditional business loan approved is by no means guaranteed. Banks will want to see a solid business plan or history in addition to a good credit rating.\u00a0Traditional loans are usually best when businesses need a predetermined amount of money for a specific purpose. That may include things such as a large equipment purchase or a set period of time you\u2019ll have to cover payroll.\u00a0Term loans oftentimes require collateral of some sort before the funds are released. This can be business equipment, real estate, accounts receivable, inventory or securities.There are instances where no collateral is required. Usually, these unsecured loans come with higher interest rates, carry extra fees or require a personal lien.\u00a0A Small Business Administration loan is similar to a standard business loan but has a couple of key differences. With an SBA loan, you still take out a loan through a banking institution. Unlike a standard loan, however, the government will back a portion of your loan. In addition, you will provide a personal guarantee against the loan. Because you and the government are relieving the majority of the risk, the bank is more likely to approve your loan and possibly offer lower interest rates.Other benefits of SBA loans include longer repayment periods, higher loan amounts and low fees. All of that probably sounds pretty good, so why don\u2019t all businesses take advantage of SBA loans? The answer is that they can be difficult to qualify for.Not only is good credit required, but businesses typically need to have been established for at least two years. A great deal of documentation is necessary, as well. Then, if you\u2019re successfully approved for a loan, it can take a while \u2014 sometimes months \u2014 to receive the funds. So if your cash requirements have a quickly approaching deadline, a traditional loan or line of credit might be a better option.\u00a0Kiplinger Advisor Collective is the premier criteria-based professional organization for personal finance advisors, managers, and executives. Learn more >As I just mentioned, lines of credit can work well for quick cash needs. With a line of credit, companies have a set amount available that they can draw from. Some lines of credit are even directly linked to a business\u2019 bank account as a kind of built-in overdraft protection.\u00a0Some businesses find lines of credit to be an efficient system, but they\u2019re definitely for smaller, ongoing cash necessities. Lines of credit almost always have higher interest rates than standard business loans. So if you consistently max out your line of credit and never look at your monthly statements, you might be unaware of how much you are paying in interest.\u00a0Whether it\u2019s a small business loan, a line of credit or an SBA loan, you\u2019ll likely be dealing with a bank. While banks must adhere to certain rules and regulations, not all of them are equal. Since your financial institution can have a major impact on your overall business wellness, choose carefully.The first thing to avoid is being tricked into a tempting introductory offer. Maybe a bank is offering an ultra-low interest rate on new loans. Check to see how long this interest rate is good for. If the rate is subject to change after six months, it might not be such a good deal.Something else to consider is the depth of the relationship you can develop with the people at your bank. With national banks, you might benefit from robust online banking capabilities and other perks but be a virtual stranger to their employees.\u00a0With local or regional banks and credit unions, there tends to be more potential for customization and negotiation. One of my peers was able to structure a line of credit at his local bank that automatically fed into multiple entities. The bank created this option at his request and did some custom coding to accomplish it. Without that close relationship, this arrangement would likely not have been available.

But just knowing the basic types and which ones might be available to you can be beneficial.\u00a0So before applying for a loan, figure out exactly what you need and why. If you don\u2019t, your business could suffer devastating cash shortages during the crucial startup stages.
