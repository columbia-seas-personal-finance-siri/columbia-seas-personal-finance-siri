I think I first read about it somewhere in this subreddit.\nThe basic concept is that you spend the month of September ('Shelftember') eating primarily out of your cupboards/ pantry/ freezer/ fridge/ deep freeze/ etc. It helps save costs and reduce waste but also helps you become creative with some of the random things that have been taking up space or getting older.\nWe are going in with a few ground rules that might be specific to us, but are relevant to note.\nFirst, we are trying to do Shelftember without sacrificing our 'normal' level of nutrition. So, we will still get our weekly CSA (veggie farm share, basically) and we will still buy basic fruit, veg, and milk. We think we can stay under $40 a week (CSA is $25 and $15 for milk and produce fill-ins that don't come in the CSA).\nSecond, we are not including birthdays/celebrations, any events we might host, etc in Shelftember. We will purchase as needed for anything like that.\nThird, this does not include pets. Honestly we have a month's supply of their foods already but if they need something, they need it, so we'll still get that.\nWe are a two-adult household in a mid-cost-of-living area with a fairly full small drop freezer, as well as a fair amount of dry goods in our 'pantry' (cupboards). We are excited to see where this takes us and hopeful we will also be able to save a little money. Might get a little 'Chopped' style by the end of the month with us having to get creative, but I think it will be fun.\nUpvote\n17\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\nSaltyComments69\n\u2022\n19 days ago\nGenerally that's a great idea.\nBut take care: Everyone should have some emergency food stash at home.

I usually have stayed away from Safeway, as the prices usually seem pretty comparatively high, but I moved to a town where Safeway is the primary grocery store, so I figured I'd use the Safeway Deals digital coupon app and give it a shot.\nThe most peculiar deal on the app I found while shopping:\nWidmer Brothers Brewing Deadlift Imperial IPA 4 pack of 16 oz cans.\nOn sale for $6.49 (original price 8.99).

If you have an interest in frugality and/or you're a regular reader/contributor who wants to help people achieve a more frugal lifestyle, please apply! The only true requirement is having a Discord account!\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16ije81/rfrugal_is_seeking_new_moderators/\nNow, back to the regularly scheduled program.\n----\nWe have decided to enact some minor rule adjustments to help improve clarity and to address a rising trend we've observed.\nTLDR\nRule 9 regarding solicitation, surveys, and spam is being combined with Rule 4 regarding self-promotion. The former Rule 9 is being replaced as No requests for material aid or financial assistance.\n----\nCombining Rules 4 and 9\nThe (former) Rule 9 addressing solicitation, surveys, and spam was borderline redundant with Rule 4 regarding self-promotion. So, we've pulled (most of) the information from Rule 9 and combined the two rules for simplicity. The new rule reads as follows:\n4. No self-promotion, solicitation, or surveys.\nr/Frugal is intended as a place for discussion, not as a market or test audience for your blog, site, service, product, or channel. Nor is it intended to promote anyone\u2019s product.\nThis rule applies to:\nSelf-promotion or solicitation of any kind, especially where you stand to gain financially.\nSurveys and petitions, regardless of the use or purpose.\nLinking to a YouTube channel, blog, or online store you own.\nPromoting your product or service.\nLinks to a company you own or work for.\nIf you are curious about what Rule 4 said previously, please click here: https://ibb.co/y4sfvDp\nIn replacement of the old Rule 9, we have added a new rule, No requests for material aid or financial assistance.\n9. No requests for material aid or financial assistance.\nr/Frugal is intended as a place for discussion, not for soliciting aid or financial support due to a challenging situation.\nThis rule applies to:\nPosts or comments asking for money, material goods, or direct assistance.\nPosts which highlight/emphasize severe hardships or dire situations which are likely to exploit the charity of other users, even if not explicitly seeking assistance.\nIf you are curious about what Rule 9 said previously, please click here: https://ibb.co/P4Q6Msz\n-----\nWhy the change?\nAt the end of the day, bad actors will be bad actors. We've experienced multiple cases where a scammer/fraudster has made a post outlining a horrible financial situation or otherwise \"buttering it up\" under the guise of seeking advice. This has lead to charitable, good faith people giving money (or offering to give money) to a fraudster under the assumption that it's helping somebody eat, take care of their child, pay their rent, etc. This is our target and what we hope to prevent. You can read more about the scam here (credit to u/Ajreil for finding this thread): https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/16qxgy9/a_common_scam_on_reddit/\nYes, there are real, genuine posts where people are in a terrible situation and need advice. But, there simply isn't an effective manner to reliably filter these out from dishonest posts. With the rise of ChatGPT bots which can manipulate the verbiage to make a post appear more genuine, this is only an increasingly large problem.\nThat being said, we don't want to hang people out to dry either. So, we'll be resurrecting a wiki page from the u/Vorokar days tailored to helping people find support or assistance. This page is linked within the new rule itself and will be attached to the removal reason for any post removed under this rule.\nThe page can be accessed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/wiki/assistance\nIf you know any subreddits dedicated towards helping people find assistance/help during a difficult situation, please link the subreddit below and provide a brief description of the requirements! This Wiki page is a bit outdated, but we would like to expand it as much as possible and we will be updating it as fast as we can!", "upvote": "12", "comment_no": "0", "comments": [], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16r6bv9/rule_changes_moderator_applications/"}, {"title": "Adult Nephew Doubled My Grocery Budget Part 2 : r/Frugal", "date": "2023-09-28 18:53:11.771000+00:00", "content": "I hope the mods will please indulge me on updating this situation. The original post is here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16s740r/adult_nephew_doubled_my_grocery_budget/\nBasically, I took in my 24yo nephew Jr. who is a very large man who works at an Amazon warehouse and he is eating everything, requires gargantuan meals, and has eaten everything edible in my pantry.\nI've spent hundreds of dollars over my food budget, and have made frequent trips to the grocery store because if I stock up on things he'll just eat them faster.\nThe deal was that Jr. lived with me for free for 90 days to save up money to get his own place and his own car.\nJr. is learning disabled and about at a 16yo level of comprehension. I did not know that before he moved in. To picture us: Jr. is a 6'8\" 400 pound black man, I'm a small white woman, my mother is a small Hispanic woman. Jr. was adopted by my sister as a baby when she married his father.\n- The Update:\nI broached therapy with my nephew and found out he is ALREADY doing online therapy once a week. In retrospect, I heard him talking to someone on his computer before, but never knew what it was. He showed me all the systems the therapist set up with him to keep him on track.\nA lot of the good I see in him that I was attributing to his grandmother is actually the therapist. She was the one who made sure Jr. showed appreciation for my hospitality, which he does.\nFor the people who say he probably isn't saving his money. I know that he is because I set him up with a high interest savings account from the beginning and he gave me access to his checking to move money over for him every payday. Should I force him to handle his own banking? Well, probably, but this way I know he's doing what he's supposed to.\nNext, the doctor visit to see if he has thyroid issues, a parasite, or some other condition. I went to the website on his Health Insurance card with him. We picked him a nurse practitioner (no doctors with good availability) and made an appointment. This being Tucson, his appointment isn't until January, but at least it's happening. If there's anything noteworthy found I'll make another update.\nThe big thing: I let my mother see my Reddit post and we went through many of your comments together. My mother seemed confused. What's this talk about him moving out in 90 days? He can't live on his own.\nI said that was the deal I made with him and his grandmother for him to live here. She agreed, but assumed it was different now that we know how learning disabled he is. How could he possibly ever live alone?\nShe has a good point, because before this I only knew him as a kid when my sister was still part of his life. I know he was held back in school at least once, but so was my brother who is very successful now. I didn't know he had the mind of a 16 year old when he moved in.\nI told her I hadn't planned on this being permanent. She asked me why not? Why can't he just live with us now?\nMy mom see's this 6'8\" 400 pound man as her little baby grandson. That grandson has taken over all of her chores (I'm the breadwinner and the chef and my mother and a housekeeper was handling the rest).\nAlso Jr. has taken to driving her to her doctor appointments, a huge deal since I work from home and she has frequent appointments. She can't drive due to poor vision and hates disrupting my work.\nThe final straw was that Jr. wanted to go to church when he moved here and my mother is the bible queen. She hadn't been going because I work late into the night and couldn't get up early enough to drive her. Now Jr. is taking her to church every Sunday. She's ecstatic.\nOn top of this, my mom and Jr. have become best friends. He's intimidated by me (as most people are, sadly) but he loves my mother. I often hear them talking and laughing together in the living room. He also runs to her when she gets dizzy and needs to hold on to something (she has virtigo) and he makes a fuss over her.\nMy mother says the only problem with him living here is the food budget. So, if he's no longer having to save up to move out and no longer has a deadline, why can't he pay for ALL the food? Ours and his.\nWhen I crunch the numbers I can see that Jr. could still save for a large vehicle, pay car insurance, gas, max his retirement account out, pay his bills, have enough \"fun\" money and savings, and still provide $1,400/month for groceries. This would be less than rent and food for him if he'd ever lived alone.\nHe'd be happy because he'd get more quality food and my mom would get to keep her grandson around.\nWhen I talked to him about he looked like I was taking a huge worry off his shoulders. He offered $2000 a month before I could bring up the $1400 (but we settled at $1400 because I want him to keep building his savings). He started selling himself to me, saying all the chores he would do and how he \"wouldn't cause me no trouble.\"\nI felt so guilty, because I realize now the 90 day deadline was really stressing him out, and he was THRILLED when I said he could just stay indefinitely. He went to call his grandmother to tell her the news and I heard her thanking God saying her prayers were answered.\nI guess I didn't have much of a chance in this situation if both his mother and grandmother were praying for this. But I'm fine with him staying. I think it's for the best.\nI will set boundaries with what food is off limits, and I'll really stock up on fruits, vegetables and healthy snacks for him. His father died young from heart disease and I don't want him to do the same.\nI'm also keeping an eye out for what job he could switch to when his body gives out from all the running around at Amazon. Someone messaged about the CDL training that Amazon offers, so maybe that. But only if he can handle it.\nAnyway, that's the resolution to this situation.

However, if you have a shift with lunch, you seriously only get 15, maybe 20, minutes to eat (this is due to the time it takes to walk from the floor to the breakroom and back). More often than not, I didn't get shift hours that consisted of anything more than a bathroom break (if I was lucky) and was left to eat at home. Usually, by the time I got home, I was starving with actual hunger pain in my stomach. The best solution I found was to ensure I had a LOT of fiber in the initial meal after getting home from work. Just a serious salad of mixed greens and fresh veggies cut into it. It helped with easing the blood sugar drop, helped with financial budgeting and was just healthier to eat. It made it possible to control simply gorging on food the rest of the day to make up for the deficit and to account for the accelerated metabolism.

The healthiest diet for cats is the one that has the least amount of vegetable matter (incl. grains, starches, etc) in it, as cats are carnivores. There is lots of research on this.\nStory time.\nMy cat developed severe IBD when he was 15yo. I spent a year going to vets, trying medication, prescription food, and nothing helped. He was vomiting and having diarrhea nearly daily, losing weight.\nIn desperation, I went to a \"healthy\" pet store and began trying him on the frozen raw cat foods they sold there. Some of those have a small amount of plant matter in them. He tolerated those better, but was still vomiting. Ultimately, I found one made of turkey without any added plant material. Thankfully, he could tolerate this and all of his GI problems went away and he lived for several more years.\nInterestingly , after switching him to this diet, his poops became very small and nearly odorless. Most likely because his GI tract was damaged, and cats are not meant to digest large amounts of plant material on a regular basis, which is why their poops are so stinky.\nThe raw food was expensive, but my cat would have died from the IBD, so I cut costs out of other parts of my budget to provide him that diet.\nUpvote\n2\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\nFoyerPatio\n\u2022\n5 hr. ago\nJust to reply to the first part of your message; yes I know that a healthier brand isn't going to be cheap.

Anything from a large known company is going to meet all of your cat's dietary requirements from a nutritional standpoint. The only differences you are going to find are protein quality and fillers. Cats are obligate carnivores, all of their natural diet is meat. So anything that is added that is not meat is a filler. Fillers aren't necessarily bad and act to bulk up food so kitty is full without getting fat, especially if they are old or inactive.\nProtein quality is the other big item. Most people would agree that something like a whole fish is healthier than just the off-cuts left over from human food being ground up. This is also tricky though because something like a chicken liver is actually BETTER for a car than a chicken breast because it is much higher in vitamins and minerals.\nSo honestly you're not going to see much difference between a mid-tier food and the most expensive boutique food at the store.

If you're broke and you're trying to get by, sometimes you just have to go cheap.

He had a housemate who used to get the cheapest shopping and try to scrounge off the others in the house, even using their soap in the shower or drinking their cans instead of his own. My brother said he didn't know if he was saving up for a golden coffin or what, because you can't take it with you.

I've taken paint from paint recycling (it was perfect, full tins just opened but not used). At the time, I thought it was great.

The father died when he was 12 and my sister had him live with her husband's mother thereafter.\nMy sister is not stable, and is not able or willing to support him. She has opted out of the situation. If I ask her to pitch in, she will just see it as an opportunity to beg or con me for money for her vices.\nHis grandmother needed to move into assisted living and Jr. had no where to go. He worked for an Amazon warehouse in his city. Since there was another Amazon warehouse in my city that he could transfer to, his grandmother asked if I'd take him in until he could get on his feet. There weren't any other options for housing for him at the time, since he lived in a much more expensive city then, and I had liked him when he was a kid, so I said we'd try it out.\nI still mostly like him. He's got a great personality. He goes above and beyond to show how much he appreciates my taking him in.\nHowever, the problem is that he's a giant of a man with a giant of an appetite at rest, and he's doing 12 hour shifts running around the huge Amazon warehouse all day.\nJr. is 6'8\" and has to be over 400 pounds. He's not fat per say, but he's one sandwich away from it. Most of his bulk seems to be muscle.\nThe agreement is that he lives here rent free while saving up for an apartment. I'm providing room and board. I knew that the grocery bill would go up with him here, but I had no idea by how much.\nAs an example, a frugal meal I make is a homemade chicken pot pie in a regular sized pie tin. My mother (who also lives with me) and I eat a slice each for lunch, a slice each for dinner, and that leaves us half a pie for the next day. I figured now that Jr. lived with me, he'd eat the other half of the pie for a meal.\nNo. Half a chicken pot pie is not enough food for one meal for him. He needs an entire extra pot pie baked for him, and then he'll still eat the four slices left over from my mother and I's pie.\nI can't cook him a steak with mash potatoes and green beans for a meal. He needs two such steaks and plates. If I make a large batch of stir fry I have to make sure I serve my mother and I before he gets to it or he is going to eat all of it for one meal.\nI tried to get smart and make big batches of rice and beans just to fill him up, or stretch out the meat sauce for spaghetti, but he can't stand it. \"Aunty I need protein! A man's got to have meat to get by! How you expect me to get by with no protein!\" He literally gets sad over it.\nJust like he literally gets happy when I make him a large amount of good quality food. He loves to eat. Food is his obsession. All he watches on TV are food programs.\nWe had a full pantry before he came to live with us. It has been wiped out. Either I'm using everything to make his titanically huge lunches, or he's at home eating everything that remotely qualifies as food. Can of maceral? Gone. Instant mashed potatoes? Gone. Granola bars that I bought to put in his lunches? Gone. Spam? Gone. And I don't even think of making brownies or cookies anymore because my mother and I will get one each if we're lucky before he inhales them all.\nI like to keep mini marshmallows around to make ambrosia. He found them in the high cupboard over the refrigerator and inhaled them in one go. The same with the canned pineapple, cottage cheese, and mandarin oranges.\nHe says that his binging on his days off makes up for how he's starving all day long at work. Yes, even with large coolers full of massive lunches.\nIt's getting so I never know if I'm going to have food available for my mother and I. I took out some ground turkey to defrost it and he came to me asking if he could have them all. \"No. That is for dinner for all of us.\" Thankfully he asked and didn't just inhale them.\nThe amount of extra grocery trips I'm having to make has gotten ridiculous. I can't even stock up on things, because having extra food around just makes him eat everything faster. It hasn't even been a month yet, but it's cost hundreds of dollars to keep him fed.\nAnd he's not a terrible person. I can tell he feels bad. He keeps asking me if I'm good with money, because I know he feels guilty. He took on cleaning the house from top to bottom once a month so I didn't have to pay for housekeeping anymore (I used to pay for a deep clean once a month).\nHe has zero willpower. If I tell him not to eat something I see him fighting with himself over it. Like his muscles and stomach are screaming at him for fuel. He's got an insane metabolism added to his size and the amount of running around he does at his work.\nAsking him for money to help pay for groceries is going to extend the time he's in my home saving up to move out. And I don't want to do that. When he moved in the agreement was 90 days. With his income he should afford rent, transportation, and everything easily, but that will just leave him $500 a month for food. There is no way that will buy him enough for even half a month. Plus, I'm sure he'll buy giant steaks and racks of ribs since that's what he wishes I would make for him all the time. I don't know how that's going to work out, but I'm taking one problem at a time.\nI signed up for this, so I'm stuck, at least until his time is up. I just need some idea on how to keep this man fed, a long with the rest of us, without it costing over $1,000 extra every month just for him. Does anyone have any ideas?

Next is to track your spending to see where it is going and how much you are spending in each category. That means budget. Being frugal is a mindset and behavior. I used to be like you and spend a lot, many times because I couldn\u2019t resist a good deal but in the end I was wasting a lot of money so I had to troubleshoot the source of this behavior. Shopping gives a rise in endorphins, it\u2019s a high. It\u2019s not much different than another addiction. So it\u2019s possible you may need therapy to identify the psychological root of your spending habit. Once you get that under control, you can take baby steps to change your mindset, then your physical habits. Then it just becomes more intuitive.\nUpvote\n4\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare", "dogsRgr8too\n\u2022\n9 hr. ago\nIdentify what you are feeling or doing that leads to spending. Are you bored? Sad? Tired? Lonely?\nExercise instead, take a walk or a hike, call a friend, read a book, check out the library for movies/books/ see if they have zoo or museum passes.\nTo choose frugality, You have to have your \"why.\" What is an important enough reason for you to start making frugal decisions?\nI grew up on the poor side, not as poor as others but we were almost out of food a couple of times. I never want to risk that again. I also am seeing people near retirement age that aren't able to stop working because they don't have enough (or in some cases anything) saved for retirement. Other things that have solidified my desire to be frugal were unexpected job loss as well as some prior medical bills. Life will throw things at you regardless of if you have savings or not, but having savings cushions the blow. In addition, the earlier you start to save and invest, the more you can take advantage of compound interest. Magic in the financial world.\nThen, you take steps to make your frugal choices.\nI would freeze your credit so you can't apply for any loans etc currently. You can unfreeze it if needed. Don't lose your pin.\nBased on your description, I would also remove any saved credit card information from online stores or mobile apps.\nOnly go to the store with a list of items you need and get tunnel vision by going directly to where those items are.\nI don't use the envelope system, but it is really effective and I think you might need it temporarily at least. --- get several envelopes and label them for your different spending categories -gas, car maintenance, grocery, restaurant, rent/mortgage, insurance, Internet, phone, entertainment etc. Take the amount of cash from your bank account that you need for each category for a month and put it in the envelope (keep it in a safe/ safe place if you have roommates you don't trust and/or just get out a weekly amount). Only spend cash from the envelope for each category. If you run out of restaurant money, stop eating at restaurants for the week/month. If you are tempted to borrow from an envelope, remember when the cash is gone, it's gone. Don't borrow from a necessity (grocery) for a want (entertainment).\nLook at the last few months' spending. Where is the biggest place you have spent unnecessarily? How can you cut that down? (Door dash? Then pick up your own food or cook at home, going to the movies? Borrow DVDs from the library cable TV? Switch to a streaming service).\nIf you are in debt, Dave Ramsey's baby steps are a good way to get out. I really don't care for his radio show anymore, but those were a nice guide for me when I was younger.\nIf you are comfortable sharing what the biggest area of spending is people might be able to give you suggestions. Food is a big one for a lot of people. If you don't know how to cook, learning how to make simple meals can help your budget a lot.\nUpvote\n3\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\ntightmetalass\n\u2022\n7 hr. ago\nBut if I use cash I won\u2019t get cash back from credit card use\nUpvote\n1\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\n2 more replies", "tightmetalass\n\u2022\n7 hr. ago\nBut if I use cash I won\u2019t get cash back from credit card use\nUpvote\n1\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\n2 more replies", "Usernamenotdetermin\n\u2022\n13 hr. ago\nGet a partner involved.

This article from Forbes provides 12 options, that the author used after selling their car. They are, by category:\nTravel avoidance: e.g. Using online delivery services to do shopping.\nHuman-powered transit: Walking and bikeshare programs.\nPublic transportation: Buses, light rail, and commuter rail.\nHired personal transit: This would cover things like Uber and Lyft, but also taxis, carsharing companies (e.g., a car rental model meant for quicker trips of e.g. an hour), and standard rental.\nKindness: For completion's sake, the author did once over the course of a month ask a friend for a ride that wasn't somewhere they were already going. Informal carpooling, though, might count under this category too; gas money for friends is I'm sure always appreciated.\nBut these aren't the only options for transit other than cars:\nThere's an entire series of non-car bicycle-like transit options these days. E-bikes would be the basic level, helping make bike transit less onerous. But heavier-duty machines get classified by law as outright electric motorcycles, and of course, there are motorcycles powered by gas too.\nRetired people nowadays may use golf carts to get around. There's probably some light stigma around that, but I don't think there should be: people do it because it works.\nWhere I grew up, a kid with access to a dirt bike or 4-wheeler might use it to drive themself to a friend's place. Snowmobiles too, although you may not have use for one in North Carolina. ATVs are effective modes of transportation.\nGetting into one of the less common ideas, the term for an enclosed human-powered vehicle is a velomobile. It's basically a bike, often recumbent, but with an aerodynamic shell. There are electric-assist models too these days; here's a YouTube video on them. All the same battery and power technologies that are improving electric cars, are improving our electric-pedal hybrid vehicles too.\nBut obtaining one might be hard; they aren't as common to want, so not as common to be made or sold either.\nUpvote\n2\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare", "pickandpray\n\u2022\n2 days ago\nebike would be useful, but you would probably still need a car once in a while (like the hotest or coldest days)\nUpvote\n1\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\n1 more reply"], "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/16sq6y1/alternative_to_a_car_in_north_carolina/"}, {"title": "How can i contact with Ollie's from another country? : r/Frugal", "date": "2023-09-27 11:23:27.556000+00:00", "content": "I really want to buy some stuff from the store since the price is just insane.

As an update, was told yesterday that one of front calipers was stripped and that was causing the squeaking sound; shop acknowledged their fault for not catching it sooner so fixed at no extra cost. After test driving tho, manager noticed sound became worse (now a screech) and front of car started to shake significantly more at low velocity acceleration. Mechanic lent me his shop car to get back to work/home bc said he didn't feel safe letting me drive my car yet & needed more time to check it out. I'm supposed to go in later today before heading downtown this evening for more work. Anxious of what I'll hear next [tho grateful for loan of shop car, it had an ongoing check engine light and tire sensor low alert that the shop tech said they can't figure out so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f...my confidence is low]. If they can't source the problem, what's a reasonable expectation on time to leave my vehicle there for diagnostics / refund? Grateful for any feedback!\nOriginal Post:\nI love my lil Honda [9 years / 113k mileage] -&- hope to make it at least another 5+ years together with standard maintenance. Today I changed the brakes/rotors; after 20 min of driving, I began to hear brakes squeak again. Thinking it might be dust from the shop, I hosed down the underbody and drove around the neighborhood; sound continued. I called the shop and will go back tomorrow.\nLast week tho, the local Brake Check quoted me twice as much as the mechanic I used, citing I needed a low arm repair and alignment, due to front end shaking while driving at low velocities ($1,200 in addition to $1k for brakes). The shop I used gave me a tiny discount for the brakes work for being a regular customer; and they didn't mention any further repair needs. They did advise tho I start planning / budgeting ahead approx $650 combined for standard 120k maintenance such as transmission flush, power steering flush, radiator service, etc.\nWhile I did anticipate would likely need to replace the shocks / an alignment soon, the rest I'm unsure about. I'm always on time with my oil changes and invested in new tires this Summer. I drive 50-100 miles/daily for work. My paycheck goes to caring for my mother, paying off past medical debt, gas & groceries; with very lil if any to spare afterwards, which goes into emergency savings. I know it's the continued squeaking that has me this frazzled -&- logically, it doesn't make sense to pick up a car payment now. My company is notorious for layoffs too.

You do not need to flush fluids.

Pull things out of the closet periodically at least twice a year to inspect for mildew. Leather and suede seems to be the worst. I don\u2019t own suede anymore and I hand wipe down leather to keep mildew off it. Clean any mildew on the walls of the closet or behind the dresser if it accumulates. Try to keep air circulating in your room. So open up your windows at least every other day for 30-60 minutes, alternatively turn on a fan. When you shower or take baths, always turn on the fan. If there is no fan, always keep the bathroom door closed and open the window and vent all the steam and moisture.

On the flip side, during the winter these curtains will help insulate the windows and prevent heat to escape.\nMany people recommened \"Green Guard\" or \" Oeko Tex\" fabric but I ultimately decided against paying extra for these features.\nTLDR: Buying a standard blackout curtain was able to bring my utility bill down $50.

I\u2019m moving out of my parent\u2019s for the first time into my own house (lived at home for 6 yrs after graduating uni to save for a house!). I used to pay my parents market rate rent + would chip in for groceries every couple of weeks, so I\u2019ve been using a budget to track my expenses and trying to live as frugally as I can for as long as I can remember.\nHowever, with rising prices + mortgage and bills, I know I have to live more frugally than ever. I will have a roommate too. My questions are:\nHow did you rebuild your savings after buying a house?\nWhat small things can I do to save more money?\nMy plan is to:\nEat out only once a week at most ($30 per week)\nShop at no-frills grocery stores\nEat less meat and more veggies (How do u make ur veggies last longer?)\nWork from home twice a week to save on gas\nThank you!!", "upvote": "32", "comment_no": "40", "comments": ["soverylucky\n\u2022\n4 days ago\nIn regards to your 4 intentions, I would modify them slightly\n1- Give yourself a $30/week budget for eating out. That way you'll be more inclined to find cheaper places so that you can get more for your money, and potentially have more than one 'eat out' meal. Things are expensive, but, for example, in my city there are places where you can get fresh chinese dumplings for $10-ish for a full meal.\n2- There isn't a single grocery store that's the best. Instead, find a store that price matches, and download Flipp or another flyer app. Look up everything that you intend to buy, and get one store to price match everything.\n3- Nothing to add here. I do it too, and now beans make up 75% of my protein needs. PM me if you want some good recipes! Veggies last longest in airtight containers. Invest in some good quality reuseable containers, or even large ziplock bags (which can be reused many times), then put your veggies in them with a sheet of paper towel to absorb moisture.\n4- If you can swing this, great! Another alternative is public transportation or biking to work, depending on your commute. I used a combination of these two things for 10 years while I lived in a city and while admittedly inconvenient, I estimate I saved between $50,000-$80,000 in car, gas, insurance, and maintenance costs. I also didn't need a gym membership when I was biking.\nETA: Other tips to save money- Don't wash your clothes as often, and hang them dry when you do. Clearly the first doesn't apply if you have a job or lifestyle where your clothes are noticeably smelly/dirty after one use, but since you can work from home, I'm guessing that's not the case. This not only cuts down on energy bills, but your clothes themselves will last 4x longer.\nRebuilding savings after a house purchase: There's a common saying that when you pay rent, it's the most you have to budget for, but when you pay a mortgage, it's the minimum you have to budget for. Things WILL break down around your house. Use Youtube and other online (or public) resources to teach yourself basic home repair. This will save you $$$$.\nUpvote\n17\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\n9 more replies", "pyrochi\n\u2022\n4 days ago\nMoving out you might need a lot of things such as a waste basket, Tupperware, utensils, bowls, cups, cleaning supplies.

A lot of our inflation comes from broken supply chains, increase in energy costs, etc. Although increasing interest rates will lower demand which will have a small impact on inflation, we have not fixed the root cause of inflation so what they are doing is not 100% effective however they only have a few tools in their tool belt.\nUpvote\n428\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\nMikeTheActuary\n\u2022\n5 days ago\nOne thing that I would add:\nSome banks have been slow to reflect higher interest rates in broader market in the rates they pay on savings accounts.\nHowever, a few banks started offering higher rates to savers, and now competition is finally driving more banks to follow.\nUpvote\n114\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\n31 more replies\n[deleted]\n\u2022\n5 days ago\nUpvote\nDownvote\nReply\nreply\nShare\nShare\nwinfly\n\u2022\n5 days ago\nThank you for this explanation.

Along those lines is there a favorite beverage you can grab some of, ice tea, soda, sparkling water. When our now out of state family returns home theres always their favorite regional soda for them.
